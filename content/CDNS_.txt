we are unable to accurately predict the full impact that the covid19 pandemic will have on our results of operations financial condition liquidity and cash flows due to numerous uncertainties including the duration and severity of the pandemic the impact of covid19 variants and the distribution acceptance and effectiveness of vaccines and containment measures our compliance with these measures has impacted our daytoday operations and could disrupt our business and operations as well as that of our key customers suppliers including contract manufacturers and other counterparties for an indefinite period of time to support the health and wellbeing of our employees customers partners and communities a vast majority of our employees are still working remotely as of february 22 2022 however we have begun a limited pilot program for employees to begin voluntarily returning to work in certain jurisdictions with lower rates of new covid19 cases and higher vaccination rates 

the disruptions to our operations caused by covid19 may result in inefficiencies delays and additional costs in our product development sales marketing and customer service efforts that we cannot fully mitigate through remote or other alternative work arrangements in addition we have experienced and may continue to experience some volatility in our hardware product delivery times due to delays in obtaining access to customer sites volatile surges in demand and in infection rates may also result in the unavailability delay or congestion of and increased costs for transportation and the raw materials inputs and other matters used in our business and by our customers moreover access by our employees to our laboratory facilities that are necessary for the development of certain ip products has been and may in the future be disrupted due to local conditions 

more generally the impact of the pandemic may increase the possibility of an extended global economic downturn and extended periods of high inflation and has caused volatility in financial markets which could affect demand for our products and services and impact our results and financial condition even after the pandemic is contained and local conditions improve for example we may be unable to collect receivables from those customers significantly impacted by covid19 and in fact have received and may continue to receive requests from our customers to delay their payments to us while we continue to provide services to these customers also a decrease in orders in a given period could negatively affect our revenues in future periods particularly if experienced on a sustained basis because a substantial proportion of our software licenses yield revenue recognized over time the pandemic may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this “risk factors” section including risks associated with our customers and supply chain we will continue to evaluate the nature and extent of the impact of covid19 to our business 

we have experienced varied operating results and our operating results for any particular fiscal period are affected by the timing of revenue recognition particularly for our emulation and prototyping hardware and ip products 

historical results of operations should not be viewed as reliable indicators of our future performance various factors affect our operating results and some of them are not within our control our operating results for any period are affected by the mix of products and services sold in a given period and the timing of revenue recognition particularly for our emulation and prototyping hardware and ip products in addition we have recorded net losses in the past and may record net losses in the future also our cash flows from operating activities have and will continue to fluctuate due to a number of factors including the timing of our billings collections disbursements and tax payments 

a substantial portion of the product revenue related to our hardware business and our ip offerings is recognized upon delivery and our forecasted revenue results are based in part on our expectations of hardware and ip to be delivered in a particular quarter therefore changes in hardware and ip bookings or deliveries relative to expectations will have a more immediate impact on our revenue than changes in software or services bookings for which revenue is generally recognized over time 

as we continue to expand our ip offerings a portion of the revenue related to our ip bookings will be deferred until we complete and deliver the licensed ip to our customers as a result costs related to the research and development of the ip may be incurred prior to the recognition of the related revenue 

table of contents 

revenue related to our hardware and ip products is inherently difficult to predict because sales of our hardware and ip products depend on the commencement of new projects for the design and development of complex ics and systems by our customers our customers’ willingness to expend capital to deploy our new and existing hardware or ip products in those projects and the availability of our new and existing hardware or ip products for delivery therefore our hardware or ip sales may be delayed or may decrease if our customers delay or cancel projects because their spending is constrained or if there are problems or delays with the supply delivery or installation of our hardware or ip products or our hardware suppliers moreover the hardware and ip markets are highly competitive and our customers may choose to purchase a competitor’s hardware or ip product based on cost performance or other factors these factors may result in lower revenue which would have an adverse effect on our business results of operations or cash flows 

a substantial proportion of our software licenses yield revenue recognized over time which may make it difficult for us to rapidly increase our revenue in future fiscal periods and means that a decrease in orders in a given period would negatively affect our revenues in future periods 

we plan our operating expenses based on forecasted revenue expected business needs and other factors such as changes in inflation these expenses and the effect of longterm commitments are relatively fixed in the short term bookings and the related revenue are harder to forecast in a difficult economic environment if we experience a shortfall in bookings our operating results could differ from our expectations because we may not be able to quickly reduce our expenses in response to shortterm business changes our operating expenses are also impacted by economic conditions such as inflation unexpected increases in inflation could cause our expenses to increase at a rate faster than our product pricing to recover such increases 

the methods estimates and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies have a significant impact on our results of operations see “critical accounting estimates” under part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” such methods estimates and judgments are by their nature subject to substantial risks uncertainties and assumptions and factors may arise over time that may lead us to change our methods estimates and judgments changes in those methods estimates and judgments could significantly affect our results of operations 

any periods of uncertainty in the global economy and international trade relations changes in governmental policies relating to technology and any potential downturn in the semiconductor and electronics industries may negatively impact our business and reduce our bookings levels and revenue 

purchases of our products and services are dependent upon the commencement of new design projects by ic manufacturers and electronics systems companies the ic and electronics systems industries are cyclical and are characterized by constant and rapid technological change rapid product obsolescence and price erosion evolving standards short product life cycles and wide fluctuations in product supply and demand 

the ic and electronics systems industries have also experienced significant downturns in connection with or in anticipation of maturing product cycles of both these industries’ and their customers’ products the current outlook for the global economy is uncertain and may result in a decrease in spending on our products and services despite recent growth 

uncertainty about future political and economic conditions adverse changes to international trade relationships between countries in which we do business or future decline in corporate or consumer spending could negatively impact our customers’ businesses reducing the number of new chip designs and their overall research and development spending including their spending on our products and services and as a result decrease demand for our products and services decreased bookings for our products and services customer bankruptcies consolidation among our customers or problems or delays with our hardware suppliers or with the supply or delivery of our hardware products could also adversely affect our ability to grow our business or adversely affect our future revenues and financial results our future business and financial results including demand for our products and services are subject to considerable uncertainties that could impact our stock price if economic conditions or international trade relationships between countries in which we do business deteriorate in the future or in particular if semiconductor or electronics systems industry revenues do not grow including as a result of the current global semiconductor shortage extending or intensifying the ability to export or import products or services by the semiconductor or electronics systems industry is adversely restricted or our supplies of hardware components and products are subject to problems or delays we may be adversely affected 

we are subject to governmental export and import controls that could subject us to liability or impair our ability to compete in global markets as well as a variety of other laws and regulations 

we must comply with regulations of the united states and of certain other countries in selling or shipping our products and transferring our technology outside the united states to foreign nationals or across borders changes in these regulations or restrictions due to changes in trade relationships with the united states including new tariffs trade protection measures import or export licensing requirements sanctions trade embargoes and other trade barriers could harm our business operating results or financial condition 

table of contents 

for example in fiscal 2019 the doc placed certain entities who are our customers on the “entity list” limiting our ability to deliver products and services to these entities when certain customers are on the entity list or are subject to new or expanded trade restrictions such as the expansion in scope by the doc of the military enduser and military enduse regulations in april 2020 and the foreignproduced direct product rules in august 2020 it will have a negative effect on our ability to sell products and provide services to these customers without first obtaining a license from the bis in addition new or expanded trade restrictions such as the continued expansion of the military enduser and military enduse rule the foreignproduced direct product rules or any future rule that will prevent a class of technology from export to any specific country or countries without a license will increase our costs or expenses entity list restrictions and other trade restrictions may also encourage customers to seek substitute products from our competitors including a growing class of foreign competitors and open source alternatives that are not subject to these restrictions or to develop their own solutions thereby decreasing our longterm competitiveness in addition although customers are not prohibited from paying and we are not restricted from collecting for products we previously delivered to them the credit risks associated with outstanding receivables from customers on the entity list – including receivables from antipiracy enforcement efforts and litigation settlements – and other trade restrictions could increase as a result of these limitations in particular china’s stated national policy to be a global leader in all segments of the semiconductor industry by 2030 has resulted in and may continue to cause increased competitive capability in china 

we cannot predict whether or when any changes will be made that eliminate or decrease these limitations on our ability to sell products and provide services to these entity list customers or other customers impacted by other trade restrictions we are unable to predict the duration of the export restrictions imposed with respect to any particular customer or the longterm effects on our business or our customers’ business additionally other companies may be added to the entity list andor be subject to new or expanded trade restrictions and restrictions may be imposed against specific countries in addition there may be indirect impacts to our business which we cannot reasonably quantify including that a countryspecific export control may limit or prevent our employees who are nationals of the restricted country from performing their duties unless a license can be obtained additionally our business may also be impacted by other trade restrictions that may be imposed by the us china or other countries restrictions on our ability to sell and ship our products to customers on the entity list have had and may continue to have an adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

failure to obtain export licenses or restrictions on trade imposed by the united states or other countries could harm our business by rendering us unable to sell or ship products and transfer our technology outside of the united states or across borders although we have implemented policies and procedures to help us comply with all applicable trade restrictions we and governmental authorities have had and may in the future have reason to inquire into particular sales for example in february 2021 we received an administrative subpoena from bis requesting the production of records in connection with certain sales to china we are cooperating with bis and are in the process of responding to the subpoena as well as conducting an internal review such inquiries are subject to uncertainties and the outcomes of this and other proceedings that may occur are difficult to predict the laws and policies of the united states and other countries in this area are evolving and changing and we have experienced and may continue to experience challenges in complying with new rules as they become effective any failure or alleged failure to comply with these laws and policies could have negative consequences including significant legal costs government investigations penalties denial of export privileges and debarment from participation in us government contracts any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operations reputation and financial condition 

in addition to export control laws our global operations are subject to numerous us and foreign laws and regulations including those related to anticorruption tax corporate governance financial and other disclosures competition data privacy and employment these laws and regulations are complex and may have differing or conflicting legal standards making compliance difficult and costly and changes to these laws may require us to make significant changes to our business operations that may adversely affect our business overall the policies and procedures we have implemented to assist our compliance with these laws and regulations do not provide complete assurance that our employees contractors agents or partners will not violate such laws and regulations any violation individually or in the aggregate could have a material adverse effect on our operations reputation and financial condition 

we have acquired and expect to acquire other companies and businesses and may not realize the expected benefits of these acquisitions 

we have acquired and expect to acquire other companies and businesses in order to expand our product offerings and enter into new markets our future revenue growth and expansion of our business is dependent on our successful integration of our acquisitions we may incur significant costs in connection with potential transactions including acquisitions that are not consummated potential and completed acquisitions involve a number of risks if any of the following acquisitionrelated risks occur our business operating results or financial condition could be adversely impacted 

• the failure to complete transactions on a timely basis or at all including as a result of governmental antitrust approval dynamics 

• the failure to realize or a delay in realizing anticipated benefits such as cost savings and revenue enhancements 

• overlapping customers and product sets that impact our ability to maintain revenue at historical rates 

• the failure to understand compete and operate effectively in markets where we have limited experience 

• the failure to integrate combine or manage acquired products infrastructure technologies and businesses effectively 

• difficulties in integrating or retaining employees 

table of contents 

• the substantial diversion of management’s attention from daytoday business when evaluating and negotiating these transactions and integrating an acquired company or business 

• unanticipated costs or assumed liabilities including those incurred to remediate issues of an acquired company discovered during due diligence or thereafter such that we cannot realize the anticipated value of the acquisition or 

• unwillingness of customers of an acquired business to continue licensing or buying products from us 

in a number of our completed acquisitions we have agreed to make future payments either in the form of employee retention bonuses or contingent purchase price payments based on the achievement of specified milestones the performance goals pursuant to which these future payments may be made generally relate to the achievement by the acquired company or business or by the employees who joined us with the acquired company or business of certain specified bookings revenue run rate product proliferation product development or employee retention goals during a specified period following completion of the applicable acquisition the specific performance goal levels and amounts and timing of employee bonuses or contingent purchase price payments vary with each acquisition we may use contingent payments in connection with acquisitions in the future and we may be required to make certain contingent payments without deriving the value we expect to derive from an acquisition in excess of such payments 

future acquisitions may involve issuances of stock as full or partial payment of the purchase price for the acquired company or business grants of restricted stock restricted stock units or stock options to employees of the acquired companies or businesses which may be dilutive to existing stockholders expenditure of substantial cash resources or the incurrence of a material amount of debt these arrangements may impact our liquidity financial position and results of operations or increase dilution of our stockholders’ equity interests in the company 

we make and expect to make strategic investments and may not realize the expected benefits of these investments 

we have made and expect to make strategic investments in which we have a minority equity interest and do not have operational control these strategic investments may also involve collaboration agreements that further and complement our strategy and marketing efforts we may not be able to realize the expected benefits of these investments and the related collaborations may be difficult to manage without sole decisionmaking authority and the economic or business interests in these collaborations may become inconsistent with our interests these challenges could have an adverse effect on our business operating results or financial condition 

the accounting applied to strategic investments depends on a number of factors including but not limited to our percentage of ownership and the level of our influence over the entity losses experienced by these strategic investment entities or associated impairment charges could adversely impact our operating results and the value of our investment in addition if these entities fail and cease operations we may lose the value of our investment and shared profits 

the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations may adversely impact our revenue expenses cash flows and financial condition 

we have significant operations outside the united states our revenue from international operations as a percentage of total revenue has historically exceeded 50 and we expect that revenue from our international operations will continue to account for a significant portion of our total revenue we also transact business in various foreign currencies although the majority of our revenue contracts worldwide are denominated in us dollars volatility of currencies in countries where we conduct business most notably the us dollar chinese renminbi japanese yen european union euro british pound and indian rupee have had and may in the future have an effect on our revenue or operating results 

fluctuations in the exchange rate between the us dollar and the currencies of other countries where we conduct business could seriously affect our business operating results or financial condition including due to inflation devaluations and currency controls for example if we price our products and services in a foreign currency we receive fewer us dollars when this currency declines in value relative to the us dollar if we price our products and services in us dollars the decrease in value of a local currency results in an increase in the price for our products and services compared to those products of our competitors that are priced in this currency this could result in our prices being uncompetitive in markets where business is transacted in the local currency on the other hand when a foreign currency increases in value relative to the us dollar it takes more us dollars to purchase the same amount of the foreign currency as we use the foreign currency to fund payroll costs and other operating expenses in our international operations this results in an increase in operating expenses approximately 34 of our total costs and expenses are transacted in foreign currencies our attempts to reduce the effect of foreign currency fluctuations may be unsuccessful and significant exchange rate movements may adversely impact our results of operations as expressed in us dollars

we could suffer serious harm to our business because of the infringement of our intellectual property rights by third parties or because of our infringement of the intellectual property rights of third parties as well as any associated efforts to enforce such rights including through intellectual property litigation 

there are numerous patents relating to our business and ecosystem new patents are being issued at a rapid rate and are owned by computational software companies as well as entities and individuals outside the computational software field including parties whose income is primarily derived from infringementrelated licensing and litigation it is not always practicable or possible to determine in advance whether a product or any of its components infringes the patent rights of others as a result from time to time we may be compelled to respond to or prosecute intellectual property infringement claims to protect our rights or defend a customer’s rights 

intellectual property infringement claims including contractual defense reimbursement obligations related to thirdparty claims against our customers regardless of merit could consume valuable management time result in costly litigation or cause product shipment delays all of which could seriously harm our business operating results or financial condition the risk of infringement and related indemnification claims associated with design ip products that are incorporated into a customer product broadly used by consumers may be higher than the risk associated with our software products in settling these claims we may be required to enter into royalty or licensing agreements with the third parties claiming infringement these royalty or licensing agreements may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all being compelled to enter into a license agreement with unfavorable terms could seriously harm our business operating results or financial condition 

any potential intellectual property litigation could compel us to do one or more of the following 

• pay damages including the potential for treble damages license fees or royalties including royalties for past periods 

• stop licensing products or providing services that use the challenged intellectual property 

• obtain a license to sell or use the relevant technology which license may not be available on reasonable terms or at all or 

• redesign the challenged technology which could be time consuming and costly or impossible 

if we were compelled to take any of these actions our business reputation or operating results might suffer 

if our security measures are breached or vulnerabilities are discovered in our products and services and an unauthorized party obtains access to customer data financial data or assets or our proprietary business information our information systems and products and services may be perceived as being unsecure we could experience business or financial harm and our business and reputation could be harmed 

our products and services involve storage including cloudbased storage and transmission of our proprietary information and that of our customers despite our security measures our information technology and infrastructure as well as our products and services may be vulnerable to cyber attacks by unauthorized third parties which may include nationstates and individuals sponsored by them or breaches due to employee error malfeasance or other vulnerabilities or disruptions which could result in unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information and could significantly interfere with our business operations or those of our customers third parties attempt to gain unauthorized access through a variety of methods such as the use of viruses malware ransomware phishing denial of service attacks and other cyber attacks and corrupt the processes of the products and services that we provide we may also be a target of malicious attacks in an attempt to gain access to our network including our cadence cloud portfolio which includes both our managed and customermanaged environments or data centers or those of our customers or end users steal proprietary information related to our business products services or infrastructure steal financial data or assets or interrupt our systems and services or those of our customers or others breaches of our security measures or vulnerabilities in our products or services could expose us to a risk of loss or misuse of this information loss of financial assets business interruption litigation and potential liability because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage information systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventive measures in recent years we have observed and expect to continue to see far reaching vulnerabilities such as the remote code execution vulnerability in log4j an open source component of the apache software foundation that was widely reported in december 2021 as impacting many systems globally furthermore we have and may continue to acquire companies with less sophisticated security measures and that have had or may experience in the future cybersecurity incidents causing business or financial harm in addition if we select a vendor that uses cloud storage of information as part of their service or product offerings or are selected as a vendor for our cadence cloud portfolio despite our attempts to validate the security of such services our proprietary information may be misappropriated by third parties in the event of an actual or perceived breach of our security or the security of one of our vendors the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed legal or regulatory actions could be initiated against us and we could suffer damage to our reputation or our business or lose existing customers and our ability to obtain new customers including government customers or suffer harm to our financial condition

risks associated with our international operations could adversely impact our financial condition 

a significant amount of our revenue is derived from our international operations and we have offices throughout the world including key research and development facilities outside of the united states our international operations may be subject to a number of risks including 

• government trade restrictions including tariffs export or import regulations sanctions or other trade barriers including licensing requirements for exports which may lengthen the sales cycle or restrict or prohibit the sale or licensing of certain products 

• countryspecific export controls could impact our employees who are nationals of the restricted country preventing these foreign nationals from performing their technologyfocused roles which may slow our pace of innovation andor impact our ability to service customers unless an export license is granted 

• limitations on repatriation of earnings and on the conversion of foreign currencies 

• reduced protection of intellectual property rights and heightened exposure to intellectual property theft 

• longer collection periods for receivables and greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable 

• difficulties in managing foreign operations 

• political and economic instability 

• unexpected changes in legal and regulatory requirements 

• differing employment practices and labor issues or inability to continue to offer competitive compensation in certain growing regions 

• variations in costs or expenses associated with our international operations including as a result of changes in foreign tax laws or devaluation of the us dollar relative to other foreign currencies and 

• public health emergencies and related public health measures including restrictions on travel between jurisdictions in which we and our customers and suppliers operate 

some of our international research and development and other facilities are in parts of the world where there may be a greater risk of business interruption as a result of political instability terrorist acts or military conflicts than businesses located domestically furthermore this potential harm is exacerbated because damage to or disruptions at our international research and development facilities could have a more significant adverse effect on our ability to develop new or improve existing products than other businesses that may only have sales offices or other less critical operations abroad we are not insured for losses or interruptions caused by acts of war furthermore our operations are dependent upon the connectivity of our operations throughout the world activities that interfere with our international connectivity or operations such as cyber hacking the introduction of a virus into our computer systems natural disasters public health emergencies civil unrest or terrorism could significantly interfere with our business operations 

in addition internal controls policies and procedures and employee training and compliance programs that we have implemented to deter prohibited practices may not prevent our employees contractors or agents from violating or circumventing our policies and the laws and regulations applicable to our worldwide operations 

we depend upon our management team and key employees and our failure to attract train motivate and retain management and key employees may make us less competitive and therefore harm our results of operations 

our business depends upon the continued services efforts and abilities of our senior management and other key employees competition for highly skilled executive officers and employees can be intense particularly in geographic areas recognized as high technology centers in addition competition for qualified personnel including software engineers in the eda commercial electronics engineering services and ip industries has intensified further increased uncertainty regarding social political and immigration policies in the united states and abroad may make it difficult to recruit employees with adequate experience and governmental policies resulting in increased funding of domestic technology companies such as china’s stated national policy to be a global leader in all segments of the semiconductor industry by 2030 has caused and may continue to cause difficulty in retaining and attracting local talent we may also experience increased compensation costs that are not offset by either improved productivity or higher sales we may not be successful in recruiting new personnel and in training retaining and motivating existing personnel our ability to do so also depends on how well we maintain a strong workplace culture that is attractive to employees particularly as we transition employees back to the office and hiring and training of new employees may be adversely impacted by global economic uncertainty and office closures in october 2021 we expanded our vaccine policy to require that us employees be fully vaccinated against covid19 or obtain an accommodation by december 2021 and the implementation of this policy may result in difficulty attracting or retaining employees from time to time there may be changes in our management team resulting from the hiring and departure of executive officers and as a result we may experience disruption to our business that may harm our operating results and our relationships with our employees customers and suppliers may be adversely affected 

table of contents 

to attract retain and motivate individuals with the requisite expertise we may be required to grant large numbers of stock options or other stockbased incentive awards which may be dilutive to existing stockholders and increase compensation expense and pay significant base salaries and cash bonuses which could harm our operating results the high cost of training new employees not fully utilizing these employees or losing trained employees to competing employers could also reduce our operating margins and harm our business or operating results 

we rely on our proprietary technology as well as software and other intellectual property rights licensed to us by third parties and we cannot assure that the precautions taken to protect our rights will be adequate or that we will continue to be able to adequately secure such intellectual property rights from third parties 

our success depends in part upon our proprietary technology we generally rely on patents copyrights trademarks trade secrets licenses and restrictive agreements to establish and protect our proprietary rights in technology and products despite the precautions we may take to protect our intellectual property third parties have tried in the past and may try in the future to challenge invalidate or circumvent these safeguards our patents and other intellectual property rights may not provide us with sufficient competitive advantages patents may not be issued on any of our pending applications and our issued patents may not be sufficiently broad to protect our technology furthermore the laws of foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights in those countries to the same extent as applicable law protects these rights in the united states and we may encounter difficulties in our attempts to protect our intellectual property in foreign jurisdictions including as a result of impacts from changes in international trade relationships the protection of our intellectual property may require the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources moreover the steps we take to protect our intellectual property may not adequately protect our rights or deter or prevent third parties from infringing or misappropriating our proprietary rights 

many of our products include software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties we may have to seek new or renew existing licenses for such software and other intellectual property in the future our engineering services business holds licenses to certain software and other intellectual property owned by third parties including that of our competitors our failure to obtain software other intellectual property licenses or other intellectual property rights that are necessary or helpful for our business on favorable terms or our need to engage in litigation over these licenses or rights could seriously harm our business operating results or financial condition 

we have substantial cash requirements in the united states but a significant portion of our cash is held and generated outside of the united states and if our cash available in the united states is insufficient to meet our operating expenses and debt repayment obligations in the united states then we may be required to raise cash in ways that could negatively affect our financial condition results of operations and the market price of our common stock 

we have significant operations outside the united states as of january 1 2022 approximately 55 of our cash and cash equivalents balance was held by subsidiaries outside the united states with the remainder of the balance held by us or our subsidiaries in the united states while we believe that the combination of our current us cash and cash equivalents future us operating cash flows and other cash that may be accessible to us on attractive terms are sufficient to meet our ongoing us operating expenses and debt repayment obligations we cannot accurately predict the full impact that covid19 may have on our cash flows in addition although the us tax cuts and jobs act the “tax act” may have reduced the tax impact of repatriation of foreign earnings there are still administrative processes associated with repatriation of foreign earnings that could affect the timing of returning cash to the us from nonus jurisdictions accordingly if our us cash were insufficient to meet our future funding obligations in the united states we could be required to seek funding sources on less attractive terms which could negatively impact our results of operations financial position and the market price of our common stock 

the long sales cycle of our products and services may cause our operating results to fluctuate unexpectedly 

generally we have a long sales cycle that can extend up to six months or longer the complexity and expense associated with our products and services generally require a lengthy customer education evaluation and approval process consequently we may incur substantial expenses and devote significant management effort and expense to develop potential relationships that do not result in agreements or revenue and may prevent us from pursuing other opportunities in addition sales of our products and services have been and may in the future be delayed if customers delay approval or commencement of projects because of the timing of customers’ competitive evaluation processes or customers’ budgetary constraints and budget cycles long sales cycles for hardware products subject us to a number of significant risks over which we have limited control including insufficient excess or obsolete inventory variations in inventory valuation and fluctuations in quarterly operating results 

our restructuring plans incur substantial costs and may not result in the benefits we have anticipated possibly having a negative effect on our future operating results 

in recent fiscal years we have initiated restructuring plans in an effort to better align our resources with our business strategy we incur substantial costs to implement restructuring plans and our restructuring activities may subject us to reputational risks and litigation risks and expenses our past restructuring plans do not provide any assurance that we will realize anticipated cost savings and other benefits or that additional restructuring plans will not be required or implemented in the future in addition our restructuring plans may have other consequences such as attrition beyond our planned reduction in workforce a negative effect on employee morale and productivity or our ability to attract highly skilled employees our competitors may also use our restructuring plans to seek to gain a competitive advantage over us as a result our restructuring plans may affect our revenue and other operating results in the future

the investment of our cash is subject to risks that may cause losses and affect the liquidity of these investments 

our marketable investments include various money market funds and may include other investments as well weakened financial markets have at times adversely impacted the general credit liquidity market prices and interest rates for these and other types of investments additionally changes in monetary policy by the federal open market committee or other relevant regulators and concerns about the rising us government debt level may cause a decrease in the purchasing power of the us dollar and adversely affect our investment portfolio the financial market and monetary risks associated with our investment portfolio may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition liquidity results of operations or cash flows 

our business is subject to the risk of natural disasters and global climate change 

our corporate headquarters including certain of our research and development operations and certain of our distribution facilities is located in the silicon valley area of northern california a region known to experience seismic activity and wildfires if significant seismic activity or wildfires were to occur or reoccur our operations may be interrupted which could adversely impact our business and results of operations 

our offices around the world may also be adversely impacted by natural disasters including those intensified by climate change our offices and those of our customers and suppliers can be disrupted by droughts extreme temperatures fires flooding and other climate changerelated risks as well as earthquakes actions by utility providers and other catastrophic events such as an actual or threatened public health emergency if a catastrophic event occurs at or near any of our offices or utility providers or public health officials take certain actions eg shut off power to our facilities or impose travel restrictions our operations may be interrupted which could adversely impact our business and results of operations if a catastrophic event impacts a significant number of our customers resulting in decreased demand for their and our products or our ability to provide services and maintenance to our customers our business and results of operations could be adversely impacted 

risks related to customers suppliers and industry competition 

customer consolidation could affect our operating results 

there has been a trend toward customer consolidation in the semiconductor industry through business combinations including mergers asset acquisitions and strategic partnerships if this trend continues it could make us more dependent on fewer customers who may be able to exert increased pressure on our prices and other contract terms and could increase the portion of our total sales concentration for any single customer customer consolidation activity could also reduce the demand for our products and services if such customers streamline research and development or operations reduce purchases or delay purchasing decisions these outcomes could negatively impact our operating results and financial condition 

our failure to respond quickly to technological developments or customers’ increasing technological requirements and to continue to develop or acquire technological capabilities could make our products uncompetitive and obsolete and impede our ability to address the requirements in technology segments that are expected to contribute to our growth 

our strategy is designed to increase our business among electronic systems companies which are now developing their own ics and other electronic subsystems our strategy is also intended to increase our business among semiconductor companies which are increasing their contribution to the end products into which their ics and other electronic subsystems are incorporated part of this strategy involves addressing the needs across a variety of vertical markets including consumer hyperscale computing mobile 5g communications automotive aerospace and defense industrial and healthcare where increased investment is expected by our customers each of these markets require technologies expertise and marketing and operations infrastructure that are applicationspecific our inability to develop or acquire these applicationspecific capabilities could impede our ability to expand our business in these categories and ultimately affect our future growth currently the industries we serve are experiencing the following trends 

• changes in the design and manufacturing of ics including migration to advancedprocess nodes and threedimensional transistors such as finfets present major challenges to the semiconductor industry particularly in ic design design automation design of manufacturing equipment and the manufacturing process itself with migration to advancedprocess nodes the industry must adapt to more complex physics and manufacturing challenges such as the need to draw features on silicon that are many times smaller than the wavelength of light used to draw the features via lithography models of each component’s electrical properties and behavior also become more complex as do requisite analysis design verification and manufacturing capabilities novel design tools and methodologies must be invented and enhanced quickly to remain competitive in the design of electronics in the smallest nanometer ranges 

• the ability to design socs increases the complexity of managing a design that at the lowest level is represented by billions of shapes on fabrication masks in addition socs typically incorporate microprocessors and dsps that are programmed with software requiring simultaneous design of the ic and the related software embedded on the ic 

• with the availability of seemingly endless gate capacity there is an increase in design reuse or the combining of offtheshelf design ip with custom logic to create ics or socs the unavailability of a broad range of highquality design ip including our own that can be reliably incorporated into a customer’s design with our software products and services could lead to reduced demand for our products and services 

table of contents 

• increased technological capability of the fpga logic chip which creates an alternative to ic implementation for some companies and could reduce demand for our ic implementation products and services 

• a growing number of lowcost engineering service businesses could reduce the need for some ic companies to invest in eda products 

• adoption of cloud computing technologies with accompanying new engagement models for an increasing number of software categories may impact our business 

• integration and optimization of solutions for system design with core eda technologies could result in reduced demand for our broad portfolio 

• with moores law slowing the trend towards more onchip integration and advanced system level 3d package design may change the requirements for the design multiphysics analysis and verification of complex homogeneous and heterogeneous systems and 

• changing enduser dynamics in our eight target technology verticals  consumer hyperscale computing mobile 5g communications automotive aerospace and defense industrial and healthcare  could advance the need from simple ics to fullsystem design and analysis capabilities that require increasingly complex computational softwarebased solutions 

if we are unable to respond quickly and successfully to these trends we may lose our competitive position and our products or technologies may become obsolete to compete successfully we must develop acquire or license new products and improve our existing products and processes on a schedule that keeps pace with technological developments and the requirements for products addressing a broad spectrum of designers and designer expertise in our industries we must provide frequent and relevant updates to our software products in order to provide substantial benefit to the customer throughout the license periods because of the rapid changes in our customers’ industries the market must also accept our new and improved products our hardware platforms must be enhanced periodically to reduce the likelihood that a competitor surpasses the capabilities we offer our introduction of new products could reduce the demand and revenue of our older products or affect their pricing we must also be able to support a range of changing computer software hardware platforms and customer preferences a transition by our customers to different business models associated with cloud computing technologies could result in reduced revenue we cannot guarantee that we will be successful in keeping pace with all or any of the customer trends 

we have invested and expect to continue to invest in research and development efforts for new and existing products and technologies and technical sales support such investments may affect our operating results and if the return on these investments is lower or develops more slowly than we expect our revenue and operating results may suffer 

we have invested and expect to continue to invest in research and development for new and existing products technologies and services in response to our customers’ increasing technological requirements such investments may be in related areas such as technical sales support and may include increases in employee headcount these investments may involve significant time risks and uncertainties including the risk that the expenses associated with these investments may affect our margins and operating results and that such investments may not generate sufficient revenues to offset liabilities assumed and expenses associated with these new investments we believe that we must continue to invest a significant amount of time and resources in our research and development efforts and technical sales support to maintain and improve our competitive position if we do not achieve the benefits anticipated from these investments if the achievement of these benefits is delayed or if customers reduce or slow the need to upgrade or enhance their computational software products and design flows our revenue and operating results may be adversely affected 

our operating results and revenue could be adversely affected by customer payment delays customer bankruptcies and defaults or modifications of licenses 

our customers have and may continue to face challenging financial or operating conditions including due to macroeconomic conditions or catastrophic events and delay or default on their payment commitments to us request to modify contract terms or modify or cancel plans to license our products our customers’ inability to fulfill payment commitments in turn could adversely affect our revenue operating expenses and cash flow additionally our customers have in the past sought and may in the future seek to renegotiate preexisting contractual commitments payment defaults by our customers or significant reductions in existing contractual commitments could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results

the competition in our industries is substantial and we may not be able to continue to compete successfully in our industries 

the industries in which we do business including software hardware ip and services for enabling the design of electronic products are highly competitive and require us to identify and develop or acquire innovative and costcompetitive products integrate them into platforms and market them in a timely manner we may not be able to compete successfully in these industries which could seriously harm our business operating results or financial condition factors that could affect our ability to compete successfully include 

• the development by others of competitive products or platforms and engineering services possibly resulting in a shift of customer preferences away from our products and services and significantly decreased revenue 

• aggressive pricing competition by some of our competitors including through significant discounts may cause us to reduce the prices of our products offer terms that are unfavorable to us or lose our competitive position any of which could result in lower revenues or profitability and could adversely impact our ability to realize the revenue and profitability forecasts for our software or emulation and prototyping hardware systems products and could over time significantly constrain the prices that we can charge for our products 

• the challenges of advancednode design may lead some customers to work with more mature less risky manufacturing processes that may reduce their need to upgrade or enhance their eda products and design flows 

• the challenges of developing or acquiring externally developed technology solutions that are adequate and competitive in meeting the rapidly evolving requirements of nextgeneration design challenges 

• intense competition to attract acquisition targets possibly making it more difficult for us to acquire companies or technologies at an acceptable price or at all 

• new entrants including larger electronic systems companies in our industry 

• the combination of our competitors or collaboration among many companies to deliver more comprehensive offerings than they could individually 

• our entry into new product categories or technology verticals including those in which success depends on absolute or relative scale 

• decisions by electronics manufacturers to perform engineering services or ip development internally rather than purchase these services from outside vendors due to budget constraints or excess engineering capacity 

• actions by regulators to limit the contractual terms that either we or our customers can apply to product and service offerings and 

• events or circumstances that damage the reputation of our company leadership products services or technologies 

for more information about our specific competitors see “competition” under item 1 of part i of this annual report on form 10k 

our future revenue is dependent in part upon our installed customer base continuing to license or buy products and purchase services 

our installed customer base has traditionally generated additional new license services and maintenance revenues in future periods customers may not necessarily license or buy additional products or contract for additional services or maintenance our customers many of which are large semiconductor and systems companies often have significant bargaining power in negotiations with us customer consolidation can reduce the total level of purchases of our software hardware ip and services and in some cases increase customers’ bargaining power in negotiations with their suppliers including us 

we depend on a single supplier or a limited number of suppliers for certain hardware components and contract manufacturers for production of our emulation and prototyping hardware products making us vulnerable to supply disruption and price fluctuation 

our reliance on single or a limited number of suppliers and contract manufacturers for certain hardware components and contract manufacturers for production of our emulation and prototyping hardware products could result in product delivery problems and delays and reduced control over contractual terms and quality in some cases it may not be practical or feasible to have multiple sources to procure certain key components we may suffer a disruption in the supply of certain hardware components if we are unable to purchase sufficient components on a timely basis or at all for any reason any supply or manufacturing disruption including delay in delivery of components by our suppliers or products by our manufacturers or the bankruptcy shutdown or upstream supply chain issues of our suppliers or manufacturers could delay our production process and prevent us from delivering completed hardware products to customers or from supplying new evaluation units to customers which could have a negative impact on our revenue and operating results for example the global semiconductor shortage in 2021 has negatively impacted and may continue to negatively impact multiple segments of the semiconductor industry including our customers

tax regulatory and litigation risks 

our results could be adversely affected by an increase in our effective tax rate as a result of us and foreign tax law changes outcomes of current or future tax examinations or by material differences between our forecasted and actual effective tax rates 

tax laws regulations and administrative practices in various jurisdictions are evolving and may be subject to significant changes due to economic political and other conditions including the fiscal impacts caused by the covid19 pandemic governments including the united states are increasingly focused on ways to increase tax revenues particularly from multinational corporations which may lead to changes in tax laws an increase in audit activity and harsher positions taken by tax authorities we are currently subject to tax audits in various jurisdictions and these jurisdictions may assess additional tax liabilities against us 

our operations are subject to income and transaction taxes in the united states and in multiple foreign jurisdictions with a significant amount of our foreign earnings generated by our subsidiaries organized in ireland and hungary any significant change in our future effective tax rates could adversely impact our results of operations cash flows and financial position our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by factors that include but are not limited to changes in tax laws or the interpretation of such tax laws in jurisdictions in which we have business activity earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions with low statutory tax rates changes in tax benefits from stockbased compensation changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities changes in our recognition or measurement of a tax position taken in a prior period increases to interest or penalty expenses new accounting standards or interpretations of such standards or results of examinations by the internal revenue service “irs” state and foreign tax or other governmental authorities in addition beginning in fiscal 2022 for united states corporation income tax purposes we are required to capitalize and amortize rd costs rather than expense these costs as incurred to the extent this requirement stays in effect it will significantly increase our fiscal 2022 effective tax rate and cash tax payments compared to fiscal 2021 

the irs and other tax authorities regularly examine our income tax returns and other nonincome tax returns such as payroll sales use valueadded net worth or franchise property goods and services consumption import stamp and excise taxes in both the united states and foreign jurisdictions the calculation of our provision for income taxes and our accruals for other taxes requires us to use significant judgment and involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes we regularly assess the potential settlement outcomes resulting from income tax examinations however the final outcome of tax examinations cannot be estimated with certainty and could be materially different from the amount that is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals for other taxes should the irs or other tax authorities assess additional taxes penalties or interest as a result of a current or a future examination we may be required to record charges to operations in future periods that could have a material impact on our results of operations financial position or cash flows in the applicable period or periods 

the current us presidential administration and congress have proposed several changes to corporate tax rules that if enacted could increase our future tax liability in october 2021 the organisation for economic cooperation and development “oecd” announced an agreement among 137 countries including ireland and hungary to adopt new rules to provide greater taxing rights to jurisdictions where customers or users are located and the introduction of a corporate global minimum tax rate of 15 with a target effective date of fiscal 2023 furthermore many countries have enacted or proposed new laws to tax digital transactions these developments in tax laws and regulations and compliance with these rules could have a material adverse effect on our operating results financial position and cash flows 

forecasts of our annual effective tax rate do not include the anticipation of future tax law changes and are complex and subject to uncertainty because our income tax position for each year combines the effects of estimating the amount and composition of our annual income or loss in jurisdictions with varying income tax rates as well as benefits from available deferred tax assets the impact of various accounting rules our interpretations of changes in tax laws and results of tax audits in addition we account for certain tax benefits from stockbased compensation in the period the stock compensation vests or is settled which may cause increased variability in our quarterly effective tax rates if there were a material difference between forecasted and actual tax rates it could have a material impact on our results of operations 

litigation government investigations or regulatory proceedings could adversely affect our financial condition or operations 

we currently are and in the future may be involved in various disputes and legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business these include disputes and legal proceedings related to intellectual property indemnification mergers and acquisitions licensing contracts customers products distribution and other commercial arrangements and employee relations matters governments and regulatory agencies in the jurisdictions in which we operate may also open or initiate investigations or regulatory proceedings for information regarding legal proceedings in which we are currently engaged please refer to the discussion under part i item 3 “legal proceedings” and note 18 in the notes to consolidated financial statements we cannot provide any assurances that the final outcome of these legal proceedings or any other proceedings that may arise in the future will not have a material adverse effect on our business reputation operating results financial condition or cash flows legal proceedings can be time consuming and expensive and could divert management’s time and attention from our business which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and operating results

errors or defects in our products and services could expose us to liability and harm our business 

our customers use our products and services in designing and developing products that involve a high degree of technological complexity each of which has its own specifications because of the complexity of the systems and products with which we work some of our products and designs can be adequately tested only when put to full use in the marketplace as a result our customers or their end users may discover errors or defects in our software or the systems we design or the products or systems incorporating our design and intellectual property may not operate as expected errors or defects could result in 

• reputational damage 

• failure to attract new or retain existing customers or market share and acceptance 

• diversion of development resources to resolve the problem 

• loss of or delay in revenue or payments and increased service costs and 

• liability for damages 

our reported financial results may be adversely affected by changes in united states generally accepted accounting principles and we may incur significant costs to adjust our accounting systems and processes to comply with significant changes 

united states generally accepted accounting principles “us gaap” are subject to interpretation by the financial accounting standards board “fasb” the sec and various bodies formed to promulgate and interpret appropriate accounting principles we are also subject to evolving rules and regulations of the countries in which we do business changes to accounting standards or interpretations thereof may result in different accounting principles under us gaap that could have a significant effect on our reported financial results 

in addition we have in the past and may in the future need to significantly change our customer contracts accounting systems and processes when we adopt future or proposed changes in accounting principles the cost and effect of these changes may negatively impact our results of operations during the periods of transition  

if we become subject to unfair hiring claims we could be prevented from hiring needed employees incur liability for damages and incur substantial costs in defending ourselves 

when companies in our industry lose employees to competitors they frequently claim that these competitors have engaged in unfair hiring practices or that the employment of these persons would involve the disclosure or use of trade secrets these claims could prevent us from hiring employees or cause us to incur liability for damages we could also incur substantial costs in defending ourselves or our employees against these claims regardless of their merits defending ourselves from these claims could also divert the attention of our management away from our operations 

we are subject to evolving corporate governance and public disclosure expectations and regulations that impact compliance costs and risks of noncompliance 

we are subject to changing rules and regulations promulgated by a number of governmental and selfregulatory organizations including the sec nasdaq and the fasb as well as evolving investor and stakeholder expectations around corporate governance executive compensation and environmental and social practices and disclosures these rules regulations and expectations continue to evolve in scope and complexity and many new requirements have been created in response to laws enacted by the us and foreign governments making compliance more difficult and uncertain the increase in costs to comply with such evolving expectations rules and regulations as well as any risk of noncompliance could adversely impact us our disclosures and public positions or commitments on these matters may change from time to time as may corresponding internal controls and external reporting standards which can expose us to reputational legal and other risks including as a result of a failure or perceived failure to achieve publicly disclosed aspirations targets or goals such as our greenhouse gas emissions reduction target or a failure to report accurately 

risks related to our securities and indebtedness 

our stock price has been and may continue to be subject to fluctuations 

our stock price is subject to changes in recommendations or earnings estimates by financial analysts changes in investors’ or analysts’ valuation measures for our stock our credit ratings and market trends unrelated to our performance furthermore speculation in the press or investment community about our strategic position financial condition results of operations business or security of our products can cause changes in our stock price in addition to these factors and industry and general economic and political conditions our stock price may be adversely impacted by announcements related to financial results or forecasts that fail to meet or are inconsistent with earlier projections or the expectations of our securities analysts or investors announcements of new products or acquisitions of new technologies by us our competitors or our customers or announcements by us of acquisitions major transaction or litigation developments or management changes a significant drop in our stock price could expose us to the risk of securities class action or shareholder derivative lawsuits which may result in substantial costs and divert management’s attention and resources which may adversely affect our business

antitakeover defenses in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and certain provisions under delaware law could prevent an acquisition of our company or limit the price that investors might be willing to pay for our common stock 

our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and certain provisions of the delaware general corporation law that apply to us could make it difficult for another company to acquire control of our company for example our certificate of incorporation allows our board of directors to designate and issue at any time and without stockholder approval up to 400000 shares of preferred stock in one or more series all 400000 shares of preferred stock are currently designated as series a preferred but because no such shares are outstanding or reserved for issuance our board of directors may reduce the number of shares of preferred stock designated as series a preferred to zero subject to the delaware general corporation law our board of directors may as to any shares of preferred stock the terms of which have not then been designated fix the rights preferences privileges and restrictions on these shares fix the number of shares and designation of any series and increase or decrease the number of shares of any series if not below the number of outstanding shares plus the number of shares reserved for issuance our board of directors has the power to issue shares of series a preferred with dividend voting and liquidation rights superior to our common stock at a rate of 1000to1 without further vote or action by the common stockholders 

in addition section 203 of the delaware general corporation law generally prohibits a delaware corporation from engaging in any business combination with a person owning 15 or more of its voting stock or who is affiliated with the corporation and owned 15 or more of its voting stock at any time within three years prior to the proposed business combination for a period of three years from the date the person became a 15 owner unless specified conditions are met 

all or any one of these factors could limit the price that certain investors would be willing to pay for shares of our common stock and could allow our board of directors to resist delay or prevent an acquisition of our company even if a proposed transaction were favored by a majority of our independent stockholders 

our debt obligations expose us to risks that could adversely affect our business operating results or financial condition and could prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under such indebtedness 

we have significant outstanding indebtedness as well as the ability to access additional borrowings under our revolving credit facility subject to the limits contained in the credit agreement governing our revolving credit facility the indenture that governs the 4375 senior notes due october 15 2024 the “2024 notes” and our other debt instruments we may be able to incur substantial additional debt from time to time to finance working capital capital expenditures investments or acquisitions share repurchases or for other purposes if we do so the risks related to our level of debt could intensify specifically our level of debt could have important consequences including the following 

• making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations to service our debt as described above 

• limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital capital expenditures acquisitions or other general corporate requirements 

• requiring a substantial portion of our cash flows including us cash to be dedicated to debt service payments instead of other purposes thereby reducing the amount of cash flows available for working capital capital expenditures acquisitions and other general corporate purposes and potentially requiring repatriation of cash from outside the united states 

• increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions 

• exposing us to the risk of increased interest rates as certain of our borrowings including borrowings under our revolving credit facility are at variable rates of interest 

• limiting our flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in the industry in which we compete 

• placing us at a disadvantage compared to other less leveraged competitors and competitors that have greater access to capital resources 

• limiting our interest deductions for us income tax purposes and 

• increasing our cost of borrowing 

at the option of the holders of our outstanding notes we may under certain circumstances be required to repurchase such notes 

under the terms of our 2024 notes we may be required to repurchase for cash such notes prior to their maturity in connection with the occurrence of certain significant corporate events specifically we are required to offer to repurchase such notes upon a “change of control triggering event” as defined in the indenture related to such notes such as a change of control accompanied by certain downgrades in the credit ratings of such notes the repayment obligations under such notes may have the effect of discouraging delaying or preventing a takeover of our company if we were required to pay the 2024 notes prior to their scheduled maturity it could have a significant negative impact on our cash and liquidity and could impact our ability to invest financial resources in other strategic initiatives 

table of contents 

the terms of the agreement governing our revolving credit facility and the indenture governing our 2024 notes restrict our current and future operations particularly our ability to respond to changes or to take certain actions 

the agreement governing our revolving credit facility contains a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and may limit our ability to engage in acts that may be in our longterm best interest including restrictions on our ability to 

• incur liens or additional indebtedness and guarantee indebtedness 

• enter into transactions with affiliates 

• alter the businesses we conduct and 

• consolidate merge or sell all or substantially all of our assets 

in addition the restrictive covenants in the agreement governing our revolving credit facility require us to maintain specified financial ratios our ability to meet those financial ratios can be affected by events beyond our control and we may be unable to meet them 

a breach of the covenants or restrictions under the agreement governing our revolving credit facility could result in an event of default under the applicable indebtedness such a default may allow the creditors to accelerate the related debt and may result in the acceleration of any other debt to which a crossacceleration or crossdefault provision applies in addition an event of default under the credit agreement governing our revolving credit facility would permit the lenders under our revolving credit facility to terminate all commitments to extend further credit under that facility in the event our lenders or note holders accelerate the repayment of our borrowings we and our subsidiaries may not have sufficient assets to repay that indebtedness as a result of these restrictions we may be 

• limited in how we conduct our business 

• unable to raise additional debt or equity financing to operate during general economic or business downturns or 

• unable to compete effectively or to take advantage of new business opportunities 

the indenture governing our 2024 notes also contains certain restrictive covenants that impose operating and financial restrictions on us and may limit our ability to engage in acts that may be in our longterm best interest including restrictions on our ability to incur liens and to enter into sale and leaseback transactions 

these restrictions may affect our ability to grow in accordance with our strategy in addition our financial results our substantial indebtedness and our credit ratings could adversely affect the availability and terms of our financing 

we may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness which may not be successful 

our ability to make scheduled payments on or refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial condition and operating performance which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial business legislative regulatory and other factors beyond our control we may be unable to maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal premium if any and interest on our indebtedness our inability to generate sufficient cash flows to satisfy our debt obligations or to refinance our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all would materially and adversely affect our financial position and results of operations and our ability to satisfy our debt obligations 

if our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations we could face substantial liquidity problems and could be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures or to dispose of material assets or operations seek additional debt or equity capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness we may not be able to effect any such alternative measures if necessary on commercially reasonable terms or at all and even if successful those alternative actions may not allow us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations the agreement governing our revolving credit facility restricts our ability to dispose of assets and use the proceeds from those dispositions and may also restrict our ability to raise debt or equity capital to be used to repay other indebtedness when it becomes due we may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain proceeds in an amount sufficient to meet any debt service obligations then due 

in addition we conduct a substantial portion of our operations through our subsidiaries none of which are currently guarantors of our indebtedness accordingly repayment of our indebtedness is dependent on the generation of cash flow by our subsidiaries and their ability to make such cash available to us by dividend debt repayment or otherwise our subsidiaries do not have any obligation to pay amounts due on our indebtedness or to make funds available for that purpose our subsidiaries may not be able to or may not be permitted to make distributions to enable us to make payments in respect of our indebtedness each subsidiary is a distinct legal entity and under certain circumstances legal and contractual restrictions may limit our ability to obtain cash from our subsidiaries in the event that we do not receive distributions from our subsidiaries we may be unable to make required principal and interest payments on our indebtedness 

table of contents 

if we cannot make scheduled payments on our debt we will be in default and holders of our debt could declare all outstanding principal and interest to be due and payable the lenders under our revolving credit facility could terminate their commitments to loan money and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation in addition a material default on our indebtedness could suspend our eligibility to register securities using certain registration statement forms under sec guidelines that permit incorporation by reference of substantial information regarding us potentially hindering our ability to raise capital through the issuance of our securities and increasing our costs of registration 

despite our current level of indebtedness we and our subsidiaries may incur substantially more debt this could further exacerbate the risks to our financial condition described above 

we and our subsidiaries may incur significant additional indebtedness in the future although the agreement governing our revolving credit facility contains restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions and the additional indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial if we incur any additional indebtedness that ranks equally with the 2024 notes then subject to any collateral arrangements we may enter into the holders of that debt will be entitled to share ratably in any proceeds distributed in connection with any insolvency liquidation reorganization dissolution or other winding up of our company 

our variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly 

borrowings under our revolving credit facility are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk if interest rates were to increase our debt service obligations on our variable rate indebtedness would increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same and our net income and cash flows including cash available for servicing our indebtedness would correspondingly decrease in the future we may enter into interest rate swaps that involve the exchange of floating for fixed rate interest payments in order to reduce interest rate volatility however we may not maintain interest rate swaps with respect to all of our variable rate indebtedness and any swaps we enter into may not fully mitigate our interest rate risk 

our revolving credit facility utilizes at our option either 1 libor plus a margin of between 0750 and 1250 determined by reference to the credit rating of our unsecured debt or 2 base rate plus a margin of 0000 to 0250 determined by reference to the credit rating of our unsecured debt to calculate the amount of accrued interest on any borrowings regulators in certain jurisdictions including the united kingdom and the united states have begun to phase out the use of libor ceasing publication for certain tenors of the us dollar and other libor at the end of 2021 with plans to cease publication for the remaining tenors of us dollar libor beginning june 30 2023 our revolving credit facility contains provisions that contemplate the transition from libor under specified events however the transition from libor to a new replacement benchmark remains uncertain at this time and the consequences of such developments cannot be entirely predicted but could result in an increase in the cost of our borrowings under our existing credit facility and any future borrowings 

in addition our revolving credit facility uses a pricing grid based on our credit ratings if our credit ratings are downgraded or other negative action is taken the interest rate payable by us under our revolving credit facility would increase credit rating downgrades could also restrict our ability to obtain additional financing in the future and affect the terms of any such financing 

various factors could increase our future borrowing costs or reduce our access to capital including a lowering or withdrawal of the ratings assigned to us and our 2024 notes by credit rating agencies 

we may in the future seek additional financing for a variety of reasons and our future borrowing costs terms and access to capital could be affected by factors including the condition of the debt and equity markets the condition of the economy generally prevailing interest rates our level of indebtedness our credit rating and our business and financial condition in addition the 2024 notes currently have an investment grade credit rating which could be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a credit rating agency based on adverse changes to circumstances relating to the basis of the credit rating consequently real or anticipated changes in our credit ratings will generally affect the market value of the 2024 notes any future lowering of the credit ratings of the 2024 notes likely would make it more difficult or more expensive for us to obtain additional debt financing

management uses certain performance indicators to manage our business including revenue certain elements of operating expenses and cash flow from operations and we describe these items further below under the headings “results of operations” and “liquidity and capital resources” 

during the second quarter of fiscal 2021 we offered a voluntary retirement program to eligible employees in the united states this program resulted in a onetime charge for voluntary termination and postemployment benefits of 268 million as of january 1 2022 liabilities related to the voluntary retirement program were 175 million and were included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities and other longterm liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet we expect to make cash payments to settle these liabilities through fiscal 2023 including 170 million that is expected to be paid in the next twelve months 

covid19 impact 

in march 2020 the world health organization declared the outbreak of covid19 a pandemic the effects of the ongoing global pandemic have been widespread and have resulted in authorities implementing numerous measures to contain the virus including travel bans and restrictions quarantines shelterinplace orders and business limitations and shutdowns we are unable to accurately predict the full impact that covid19 will have on our results of operations financial condition liquidity and cash flows due to numerous uncertainties including the duration and severity of the pandemic and containment measures and the distribution acceptance and effectiveness of vaccines our efforts to comply with these containment measures have impacted our daytoday operations and could disrupt our business and operations as well as that of our key customers suppliers including contract manufacturers and other counterparties for an indefinite period of time to support the health and wellbeing of our employees customers partners and communities a vast majority of our employees are still working remotely as of january 1 2022 however we have begun a limited pilot program for employees to begin voluntarily returning to work in certain jurisdictions with lower rates of new covid19 cases and higher vaccination rates 

since its inception the covid19 pandemic has caused some volatility in our delivery timing for our hardware and ip products to certain customers many of our customers’ employees are working remotely and in some cases we have experienced delivery lead times that are longer than normal because of delays in getting access to customer sites to complete our deliveries in other cases the amount of our hardware and ip products that we have been able to deliver has been greater than we originally anticipated at the beginning of the respective period despite the challenges the covid19 pandemic has posed to our operations it did not have a material adverse impact on our results of operations financial condition liquidity or cash flows during fiscal 2021 we will continue to evaluate the nature and extent of the impact of covid19 on our business see part i item 1a “risk factors” for additional information on the impact of covid19 on our business 

results of operations 

the discussion of our fiscal 2021 consolidated results of operations include yearoveryear comparisons to fiscal 2020 for revenue cost of revenue operating expenses operating margin other nonoperating expenses income taxes and cash flows for a discussion of the fiscal 2020 changes compared to fiscal 2019 see the discussion in item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in our annual report on form 10k for the fiscal year ended january 2 2021 filed on february 22 2021 

our fiscal years are 52 or 53week periods ending on the saturday closest to december 31 fiscal 2021 was a 52week fiscal year compared to 2020 which was a 53week fiscal year the additional week in fiscal 2020 resulted in additional revenue of approximately 45 million and additional expense including stockbased compensation and amortization of acquired intangibles of approximately 35 million 

results of operations for fiscal 2021 as compared to fiscal 2020 reflect the following 

• revenue growth that exceeded the growth of our costs and expenses 

• increased product and maintenance revenue primarily from growth in our software and hardware product offerings 

• continued investment in research and development activities focused on expanding and enhancing our product portfolio and 

• higher selling costs including additional investment in technical sales support in response to our customers’ increasing technological requirements

revenue 

we primarily generate revenue from licensing our software and ip selling or leasing our emulation and prototyping hardware technology providing maintenance for our software hardware and ip providing engineering services and earning royalties generated from the use of our ip the timing of our revenue is significantly affected by the mix of software hardware and ip products generating revenue in any given period and whether the revenue is recognized over time or at a point in time upon completion of delivery 

in any fiscal year we expect that between 85 and 90 of our annual revenue will be characterized as recurring revenue revenue characterized as recurring includes revenue recognized over time from our software arrangements services royalties maintenance on ip licenses and hardware and operating leases of hardware and revenue recognized at varying points in time over the term of our ip access agreements that include noncancellable commitments from customers 

the remainder of our revenue is recognized at a point in time and is characterized as upfront revenue upfront revenue is primarily generated by our sales of emulation and prototyping hardware and individual ip licenses the percentage of our recurring and upfront revenue and fluctuations in revenue within our geographies are impacted by delivery of hardware and ip products to our customers in any single fiscal period 

revenue by year 

the following table shows our revenue for fiscal 2021 and 2020 and the change in revenue between years 



product and maintenance revenue increased during fiscal 2021 as compared to fiscal 2020 primarily because of increased revenue from each of our five product categories this growth is driven by our customers investing in new complex designs for their products including electronic systems for consumer hyperscale computing 5g communications automotive aerospace and defense industrial and healthcare 

services revenue increased during fiscal 2021 as compared to fiscal 2020 primarily due to the timing of performance obligations being fulfilled for certain customer contracts during fiscal 2021 services revenue may fluctuate from period to period based on the timing of fulfillment of our services and ip performance obligations 

no one customer accounted for 10 or more of total revenue during fiscal 2021 or 2020 

revenue by product category 

the following table shows the percentage of product and related maintenance revenue contributed by each of our five product categories and services during fiscal 2021 and 2020 



revenue by product category fluctuates from period to period based on demand for our products and services our available resources and our ability to deliver and support them certain of our licensing arrangements allow customers the ability to remix among software products additionally we have arrangements with customers that include a combination of our products with the actual product selection and number of licensed users to be determined at a later date for these arrangements we estimate the allocation of the revenue to product categories based upon the expected usage of our products the actual usage of our products by these customers may differ and if that proves to be the case the revenue allocation in the table above would differ 

table of contents 

revenue by geography 



the increase in revenue in the united states and other asia during fiscal 2021 as compared to fiscal 2020 was attributable to growth in revenue from each of our five product categories 

the decrease in revenue in china during fiscal 2021 as compared to fiscal 2020 was due to higherthantypical volume in china during fiscal 2020 during fiscal 2020 we experienced an increase in demand for our emulation and prototyping hardware and ip product offerings from our customers in china that resulted in a larger percentage of total revenue coming from that geography 

the increase in revenue in europe middle east and africa during fiscal 2021 as compared to fiscal 2020 was attributable to growth in revenue from system design and analysis digital ic design and custom ic design product offerings 

revenue by geography as a percent of total revenue 

most of our revenue is transacted in the united states dollar however certain revenue transactions are denominated in foreign currencies for an additional description of how changes in foreign exchange rates affect our consolidated financial statements see the discussion under item 7a “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk – foreign currency risk” 

cost of revenue 

  

the following table shows cost of revenue as a percentage of related revenue for fiscal 2021 and 2020 

  

table of contents 

cost of product and maintenance 

cost of product and maintenance includes costs associated with the sale and lease of our emulation and prototyping hardware and licensing of our software and ip products certain employee salary and benefits and other employeerelated costs cost of our customer support services amortization of technologyrelated and maintenancerelated acquired intangibles costs of technical documentation and royalties payable to thirdparty vendors cost of product and maintenance depends primarily on our hardware product sales in any given period but is also affected by employee salary and benefits and other employeerelated costs reserves for inventory and the timing and extent to which we acquire intangible assets license thirdparty technology or ip and sell our products that include such acquired or licensed technology or ip 

a summary of cost of product and maintenance for fiscal 2021 and 2020 is as follows 

product and maintenancerelated costs decreased during fiscal 2021 when compared to fiscal 2020 due to the following 



costs associated with our emulation and prototyping hardware products include components assembly testing applicable reserves and overhead these costs make our cost of emulation and prototyping hardware products higher as a percentage of revenue than our cost of software and ip products the decrease in emulation and prototyping hardware costs during fiscal 2021 as compared to fiscal 2020 was primarily due to the mix of products generating revenue and a decrease in charges related to previous generations of our emulation hardware 

amortization of acquired intangibles included in cost of product and maintenance increased during fiscal 2021 as compared to fiscal 2020 primarily due to technologyrelated intangible assets acquired with our acquisitions of numeca and pointwise during the first half of fiscal 2021 and inprocess technology being placed into service during the second quarter of fiscal 2020 this increase was partially offset by certain technologyrelated intangible assets becoming fully amortized during fiscal 2021 and during fiscal 2020 

cost of services 

cost of services primarily includes employee salary benefits and other employeerelated costs to perform work on revenuegenerating projects and costs to maintain the infrastructure necessary to manage a services organization cost of services may fluctuate from period to period based on our utilization of design services engineers on revenuegenerating projects rather than internal development projects 

operating expenses 

our operating expenses include marketing and sales research and development and general and administrative expenses factors that tend to cause our operating expenses to fluctuate include changes in the number of employees due to hiring and acquisitions our annual merit cycle stockbased compensation restructuring and other employment separation activities such as the voluntary retirement program foreign exchange rate movements volatility in variable compensation programs that are driven by operating results and charitable donations 

many of our operating expenses are transacted in various foreign currencies we recognize lower expenses in periods when the united states dollar strengthens in value against other currencies and we recognize higher expenses when the united states dollar weakens against other currencies for an additional description of how changes in foreign exchange rates affect our consolidated financial statements see the discussion in item 7a “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk – foreign currency risk” 

table of contents 

our operating expenses for fiscal 2021 and 2020 were as follows 



our operating expenses as a percentage of total revenue for fiscal 2021 and 2020 were as follows 



  marketing and sales 

the changes in marketing and sales expense were due to the following 



salary benefits and other employeerelated costs included in marketing and sales increased during fiscal 2021 as compared to fiscal 2020 primarily due to additional headcount from hiring and acquisitions and increased variable compensation this increase was partially offset by reduced home officerelated expenses associated with the transition to a remote work environment during fiscal 2020 due to the covid19 pandemic 

research and development 

the changes in research and development expense were due to the following 

table of contents 

salary benefits and other employeerelated costs included in research and development expense increased during fiscal 2021 as compared to fiscal 2020 due primarily to additional headcount from hiring and acquisitions as we continue to expand and enhance our product portfolio this increase was partially offset by reduced home officerelated expenses associated with the transition to a remote work environment during fiscal 2020 due to the covid19 pandemic 

general and administrative 

the changes in general and administrative expense were due to the following 



the increase in contributions to nonprofit organizations is the result of our continued commitment to support charitable initiatives during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 we launched the cadence giving foundation a standalone nonprofit organization that was established to partner with other charitable initiatives to give back to the communities where we live and work the cadence giving foundation will also support critical needs in areas such as diversity equity and inclusion environmental sustainability and stem education 

salary benefits and other employeerelated costs included in general and administrative expense increased during fiscal 2021 as compared to fiscal 2020 due primarily to additional headcount from hiring and acquisitions 

amortization of acquired intangibles 

amortization of acquired intangibles consists primarily of amortization of customer relationships acquired backlog trade names trademarks and patents amortization in any given period depends primarily on the timing and extent to which we acquire intangible assets 



amortization of acquired intangibles increased during fiscal 2021 as compared to fiscal 2020 primarily due to intangibles assets acquired from pointwise and numeca during fiscal 2021 

restructuring 

we have initiated restructuring plans in recent years most recently in fiscal 2020 to better align our resources with our business strategy because the restructuring charges and related benefits are derived from management’s estimates made during the formulation of the restructuring plans based on thencurrently available information our restructuring plans may not achieve the benefits anticipated on the timetable or at the level contemplated additional actions including further restructuring of our operations may be required in the future for additional information about our restructuring plans see note 16 in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

operating margin 

operating margin represents income from operations as a percentage of total revenue our operating margin for fiscal 2021 and 2020 was as follows 



operating margin increased during fiscal 2021 as compared to fiscal 2020 primarily because revenue growth in each of our five product categories exceeded growth in operating expenses 

table of contents 

interest expense 

interest expense for fiscal 2021 and 2020 was comprised of the following 



interest expense decreased during fiscal 2021 as compared to fiscal 2020 primarily due to a decrease in outstanding borrowing under our revolving credit facility during the first quarter of fiscal 2020 we had outstanding borrowings of 350 million under our revolving credit facility as a precautionary measure to provide additional liquidity in light of global economic uncertainty that was present at that time all outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility were repaid in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 for an additional description of our debt arrangements including our revolving credit facility see note 3 in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

income taxes 

the following table presents the provision for income taxes and the effective tax rate for fiscal 2021 and 2020 



our provision for fiscal 2021 was primarily attributable to federal state and foreign income taxes on our fiscal 2021 income partially offset by the tax benefit of 221 million related to our foreignderived intangible income and the tax benefit of 643 million related to stockbased compensation that vested or was exercised during the period we also recognized a tax benefit of 105 million related to the release of the valuation allowance on our massachusetts rd tax credits because we expect to utilize these tax credits prior to expiration based on strong current earnings and future taxable income projections 

our provision for fiscal 2020 was primarily attributable to federal state and foreign income taxes on our fiscal 2020 income partially offset by the tax benefit of 222 million related to the partial release of the valuation allowance on our california rd tax credit deferred tax assets and the tax benefit of 601 million related to stockbased compensation that vested or was exercised during fiscal 2020 

the united states enacted the tax cuts and jobs act in december 2017 that requires companies to capitalize all of their rd costs including software development costs incurred in tax years beginning after december 31 2021 beginning in fiscal 2022 we must capitalize and amortize rd costs over five years for domestic research and 15 years for international research rather than expensing these costs as incurred if the united states doesn’t repeal or defer the effective date of the law in the future then we expect our fiscal 2022 effective tax rate and our cash tax payments to increase significantly as compared to fiscal 2021 we also expect to recognize increases to our deferred tax assets as we begin to capitalize domestic research costs 

our future effective tax rates may also be materially impacted by tax amounts associated with our foreign earnings at rates different from the united states federal statutory rate research credits the tax impact of stockbased compensation accounting for uncertain tax positions business combinations closure of statutes of limitations or settlement of tax audits changes in valuation allowance and changes in tax law a significant amount of our foreign earnings is generated by our subsidiaries organized in ireland and hungary our future effective tax rates may be adversely affected if our earnings were to be lower in countries where we have lower statutory tax rates we currently expect that our fiscal 2022 effective tax rate will be approximately 25 we expect that our quarterly effective tax rates will vary from our fiscal 2022 effective tax rate as a result of recognizing the income tax effects of stockbased awards in the quarterly periods that the awards vest or are settled and other items that we cannot anticipate for additional discussion about how our effective tax rate could be affected by various risks see part i item 1a “risk factors” for further discussion regarding our income taxes see note 8 in the notes to consolidated financial statements

liquidity and capital resources 

cash and cash equivalents 

as of january 1 2022 our principal sources of liquidity consisted of 10889 million of cash and cash equivalents as compared to 9284 million as of january 2 2021 

our primary sources of cash and cash equivalents during fiscal 2021 were cash generated from operations proceeds from the exercise of stock options and proceeds from stock purchases under our employee stock purchase plan 

our primary uses of cash and cash equivalents during fiscal 2021 were payments related to salaries and benefits operating expenses repurchases of our common stock payments for business combinations net of cash acquired payments for income taxes purchases of inventory payment of employee taxes on vesting of restricted stock and purchases of property plant and equipment 

approximately 55 of our cash and cash equivalents were held by our foreign subsidiaries as of january 1 2022 our cash and cash equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries may vary from period to period due to the timing of collections and repatriation of foreign earnings 

net working capital 

net working capital is comprised of current assets less current liabilities as shown on our consolidated balance sheets the increase in our net working capital as of january 1 2022 as compared to january 2 2021 is primarily due to improved results from operations the timing of cash receipts from customers and disbursements made to vendors 

cash flows from operating activities 

cash flows from operating activities during fiscal 2021 and 2020 were as follows 

cash flows from operating activities include net income adjusted for certain noncash items as well as changes in the balances of certain assets and liabilities our cash flows from operating activities are significantly influenced by business levels and the payment terms set forth in our customer agreements the increase in cash flows from operating activities during fiscal 2021 as compared to fiscal 2020 was primarily due to improved results from operations and timing of cash receipts from customers and disbursements made to vendors 

cash flows from investing activities 

cash flows used for investing activities during fiscal 2021 and 2020 were as follows 

cash used for investing activities during fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020 consisted primarily of cash paid in business combinations net of cash acquired and payments for purchases of property plant and equipment we expect to continue our investing activities including purchasing property plant and equipment purchasing intangible assets business combinations purchasing software licenses and making strategic investments 

table of contents 

cash flows from financing activities 

cash flows used for financing activities during fiscal 2021 and 2020 were as follows 

the increase in cash used for financing activities during fiscal 2021 as compared to fiscal 2020 was primarily due to an increase in payments for repurchases of our common stock 

other factors affecting liquidity and capital resources 

stock repurchase program 

as of the end of fiscal 2020 approximately 739 million remained available under the previously announced authorization to repurchase shares of our common stock in august 2021 our board of directors increased the prior authorization to repurchase shares of our common stock by authorizing an additional 1 billion the actual timing and amount of repurchases are subject to business and market conditions corporate and regulatory requirements stock price acquisition opportunities and other factors as of january 1 2022 approximately 11 billion remained available to repurchase shares of our common stock see part ii item 5 “market for registrant’s common equity related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities” for additional information 

revolving credit facility 

on june 30 2021 we terminated our thenexisting revolving credit facility dated january 30 2017 and entered into a fiveyear senior unsecured revolving credit facility with a group of lenders led by bank of america na as administrative agent the “2021 credit facility” the 2021 credit facility provides for borrowings up to 7000 million with the right to request increased capacity up to an additional 3500 million upon receipt of lender commitments for total maximum borrowings of 105 billion the 2021 credit facility expires on june 30 2026 any outstanding loans drawn under the 2021 credit facility are due at maturity on june 30 2026 subject to an option to extend the maturity date outstanding borrowings may be repaid at any time prior to maturity as of january 1 2022 there were no borrowings outstanding under the 2021 credit facility and we were in compliance with all financial covenants associated with such credit facility 

2024 notes 

in october 2014 we issued 3500 million aggregate principal amount of 4375 senior notes due october 15 2024 we received net proceeds of 3424 million from the issuance of the 2024 notes net of a discount of 14 million and issuance costs of 62 million interest is payable in cash semiannually the 2024 notes are unsecured and rank equal in right of payment to all of our existing and future senior indebtedness as of january 1 2022 we were in compliance with all covenants associated with the 2024 notes 

for additional information relating to our debt arrangements see note 3 in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

other liquidity requirements 

a summary of other capital and liquidity requirements as of january 1 2022 is as follows 



 

1 this table includes future payments under leases that had commenced as of january 1 2022 as well as leases that had been signed but not yet commenced as of january 1 2022 

2 included in other longterm contractual obligations are longterm income tax liabilities of 231 million related to unrecognized tax benefits the remaining portion of other longterm contractual obligations is primarily liabilities associated with defined benefit retirement plans and acquisitions 

table of contents 

we expect that current cash and cash equivalent balances cash flows that are generated from operations and financing activities will be sufficient to meet the needs of our domestic and international operating activities and other capital and liquidity requirements including acquisitions and share repurchases for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

as of january 1 2022 we did not have any significant offbalance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our operating results or financial condition 

critical accounting estimates 

in preparing our consolidated financial statements we make assumptions judgments and estimates that can have a significant impact on our revenue operating income and net income as well as on the value of certain assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets we base our assumptions judgments and estimates on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions at least quarterly we evaluate our assumptions judgments and estimates and make changes as deemed necessary 

we believe that the assumptions judgments and estimates involved in the accounting for income taxes revenue recognition and business combinations have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements therefore we consider these to be our critical accounting estimates for information on our significant accounting policies see note 2 in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition 

our contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple software andor ip licenses hardware and services including professional services technical support services and rights to unspecified updates to a customer these contracts require us to apply judgment in identifying and evaluating any terms and conditions in contracts which may impact revenue recognition determining whether licenses and services are distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately or not distinct and thus accounted for together requires significant judgment in some arrangements such as most of our ip license arrangements we have concluded that the licenses and associated services are distinct from each other in other arrangements like our timebased software arrangements the licenses and certain services are not distinct from each other our timebased software arrangements include multiple software licenses and updates to the licensed software products as well as technical support and we have concluded that these promised goods and services are a single combined performance obligation 

judgment is required to determine the standalone selling prices “ssps” for each distinct performance obligation we rarely license or sell products on a standalone basis so we are required to estimate the ssp for each performance obligation in instances where the ssp is not directly observable because we do not sell the license product or service separately we determine the ssp using information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs we typically have more than one ssp for individual performance obligations due to the stratification of those items by classes of customers and circumstances in these instances we may use information such as the size of the customer and geographic region of the customer in determining the ssp 

revenue is recognized over time for our combined performance obligations that include software licenses updates and technical support as well as for maintenance and professional services that are separate performance obligations for our professional services revenue is recognized over time generally using costs incurred or hours expended to measure progress judgment is required in estimating project status and the costs necessary to complete projects a number of internal and external factors can affect these estimates including labor rates utilization and efficiency variances and specification and testing requirement changes for our other performance obligations recognized over time revenue is generally recognized using a timebased measure of progress reflecting generally consistent efforts to satisfy those performance obligations throughout the arrangement term 

if a group of agreements are so closely related that they are in effect part of a single arrangement such agreements are deemed to be one arrangement for revenue recognition purposes we exercise significant judgment to evaluate the relevant facts and circumstances in determining whether the separate agreements should be accounted for separately or as in substance a single arrangement our judgments about whether a group of contracts comprise a single arrangement can affect the allocation of consideration to the distinct performance obligations which could have an effect on results of operations for the periods involved 

we are required to estimate the total consideration expected to be received from contracts with customers in some circumstances the consideration expected to be received is variable based on the specific terms of the contract or based on our expectations of the term of the contract generally we have not experienced significant returns or refunds to customers these estimates require significant judgment and the change in these estimates could have an effect on our results of operations during the periods involved 

table of contents 

accounting for income taxes 

we are subject to income taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our provision for these taxes there are many transactions that occur during the ordinary course of business for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain our provision for income taxes could be adversely affected by our earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries where we have higher statutory rates losses incurred in jurisdictions for which we are not able to realize the related tax benefit changes in foreign currency exchange rates entry into new businesses and geographies and changes to our existing businesses acquisitions and investments changes in our deferred tax assets and liabilities including changes in our assessment of valuation allowances changes in the relevant tax laws or interpretations of these tax laws and developments in current and future tax examinations 

we only recognize the tax benefit of an income tax position if we judge that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained solely on its technical merits in a tax audit including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes to make this judgment we must interpret complex and sometimes ambiguous tax laws regulations and administrative practices if we judge that an income tax position meets this recognition threshold then we must measure the amount of the tax benefit to be recognized by estimating the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50 cumulative probability of being realized upon settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all of the relevant facts it is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts as this requires us to determine the probability of various possible settlement outcomes we must reevaluate our income tax positions on a quarterly basis to consider factors such as changes in facts or circumstances changes in tax law effectively settled issues under audit the lapse of applicable statute of limitations and new audit activity such a change in recognition or measurement would result in recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision for a more detailed description of our unrecognized tax benefits see note 8 in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

during fiscal 2019 we completed intercompany transfers of certain intangible property rights to our irish subsidiary which resulted in the establishment of a deferred tax asset and the recognition of an income tax benefit of 5756 million to determine the value of the deferred tax asset we were required to make significant estimates in determining the fair value of the transferred ip rights these estimates included but are not limited to the income and cash flows that the ip rights are expected to generate in the future the appropriate discount rate to apply to the income and cash flow projections and the useful lives of the ip rights these estimates are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and if different estimates were used it would impact the fair value of the ip rights and the related value of the deferred tax asset and the income tax benefit recognized in fiscal 2019 and in future periods when the deferred tax asset is realized in addition we reviewed the need to establish a valuation allowance on the deferred tax asset of 5756 million by evaluating whether there is a greater than 50 likelihood that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized to make this judgment we must make significant estimates and predictions of the amount and category of future taxable income from various sources and weigh all available positive and negative evidence about these possible sources of taxable income we give greater weight to evidence that can be objectively verified based on our evaluation and weighting of the positive and negative evidence we concluded that it is greater than 50 likely that the deferred tax asset of 5756 million will be realized in future periods and that a valuation allowance was not currently required if in the future we evaluate that this deferred tax asset is not likely to be realized an increase in the related valuation allowance could result in a material income tax expense in the period such a determination is made 

business combinations 

when we acquire businesses we allocate the purchase price to the acquired tangible assets and assumed liabilities including deferred revenue liabilities associated with the fair value of contingent consideration and acquired identifiable intangible assets any residual purchase price is recorded as goodwill the allocation of the purchase price requires us to make significant estimates in determining the fair values of these acquired assets and assumed liabilities especially with respect to intangible assets and goodwill these estimates are based on information obtained from management of the acquired companies our assessment of this information and historical experience these estimates can include but are not limited to the cash flows that an acquired business is expected to generate in the future the cash flows that specific assets acquired with that business are expected to generate in the future the appropriate weighted average cost of capital and the cost savings expected to be derived from acquiring an asset these estimates are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and if different estimates were used the purchase price for the acquisition could be allocated to the acquired assets and assumed liabilities differently from the allocation that we have made to the acquired assets and assumed liabilities in addition unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that may affect the accuracy or validity of such estimates and if such events occur we may be required to adjust the value allocated to acquired assets or assumed liabilities 

we also make significant judgments and estimates when we assign useful lives to the definitelived intangible assets identified as part of our acquisitions these estimates are inherently uncertain and if we used different estimates the useful life over which we amortize intangible assets would be different in addition unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that may impact the useful life assigned to our intangible assets which would impact our amortization of intangible assets expense and our results of operations 

during fiscal 2021 we acquired intangible assets of 889 million with our acquisition of numeca and pointwise the fair value of the definitelived intangible assets acquired with these acquisitions was determined using variations of the income approach 

table of contents 

for acquired existing technology the fair value was determined by applying the relieffromroyalty method this method is based on the application of a royalty rate to forecasted revenue to quantify the benefit of owning the intangible asset rather than paying a royalty for use of the asset to estimate royalty savings over time we projected revenue from the acquired existing technology over the estimated remaining life of the technology including the effect of assumed technological obsolescence before applying an assumed royalty rate for numeca we assumed technological obsolescence at a rate of 67 annually before applying an assumed royalty rate of 22 for pointwise we assumed technological obsolescence at a rate of 100 annually before applying an assumed royalty rate of 25 the present value of aftertax royalty savings were determined using discount rates ranging from 105 to 120 

the fair value for acquired agreements and relationships was determined by using the multiperiod excess earnings method this method reflects the present value of the projected cash flows that are expected to be generated from existing customers less charges representing the contribution of other assets to those cash flows projected income from existing customer relationships considered a customer retention rate of 95 for both numeca and pointwise the present value of operating cash flows from existing customers was determined using discount rates ranging from 105 to 120 

we believe that our estimates and assumptions related to the fair value of its acquired intangible assets are reasonable but significant judgment is involved

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

foreign currency risk 

a material portion of our revenue expenses and business activities are transacted in the us dollar in certain foreign countries where we price our products and services in us dollars a decrease in value of the local currency relative to the us dollar results in an increase in the prices for our products and services compared to those products of our competitors that are priced in local currency this could result in our prices being uncompetitive in certain markets 

in certain countries where we may invoice customers in the local currency our revenues benefit from a weaker dollar and are adversely affected by a stronger dollar the opposite impact occurs in countries where we record expenses in local currencies in those cases our costs and expenses benefit from a stronger dollar and are adversely affected by a weaker dollar the fluctuations in our operating expenses outside the united states resulting from volatility in foreign exchange rates are not generally moderated by corresponding fluctuations in revenues from existing contracts 

we enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to protect against currency exchange risks associated with existing assets and liabilities a foreign currency forward exchange contract acts as a hedge by increasing in value when underlying assets decrease in value or underlying liabilities increase in value due to changes in foreign exchange rates conversely a foreign currency forward exchange contract decreases in value when underlying assets increase in value or underlying liabilities decrease in value due to changes in foreign exchange rates these forward contracts are not designated as accounting hedges so the unrealized gains and losses are recognized in other income net in advance of the actual foreign currency cash flows with the fair value of these forward contracts being recorded as accrued liabilities or other current assets 

we do not use forward contracts for trading purposes our forward contracts generally have maturities of 90 days or less we enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts based on estimated future asset and liability exposures and the effectiveness of our hedging program depends on our ability to estimate these future asset and liability exposures recognized gains and losses with respect to our current hedging activities will ultimately depend on how accurately we are able to match the amount of foreign currency forward exchange contracts with actual underlying asset and liability exposures 

the following table provides information about our foreign currency forward exchange contracts as of january 1 2022 the information is provided in united states dollar equivalent amounts the table presents the notional amounts at contract exchange rates and the weighted average contractual foreign currency exchange rates expressed as units of the foreign currency per united states dollar which in some cases may not be the market convention for quoting a particular currency all of these forward contracts matured during february 2022 



we actively monitor our foreign currency risks but our foreign currency hedging activities may not substantially offset the impact of fluctuations in currency exchange rates on our results of operations cash flows and financial position 

table of contents 

interest rate risk 

our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our portfolio of cash and cash equivalents and balances outstanding on our revolving credit facility if any we are exposed to interest rate fluctuations in many of the world’s leading industrialized countries but our interest income and expense is most sensitive to fluctuations in the general level of united states interest rates in this regard changes in united states interest rates affect the interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents and the costs associated with foreign currency hedges 

all highly liquid securities with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase are considered to be cash equivalents the carrying value of our interestbearing instruments approximated fair value as of january 1 2022 

interest rates under our revolving credit facility are variable so interest expense could be adversely affected by changes in interest rates particularly for periods when we maintain a balance outstanding under the revolving credit facility interest rates for our revolving credit facility can fluctuate based on changes in market interest rates and in an interest rate margin that varies based on our consolidated leverage ratio assuming all loans were fully drawn and we were to fully exercise our right to increase borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility each quarter point change in interest rates would result in a 26 million change in annual interest expense on our indebtedness under our revolving credit facility as of january 1 2022 there were no borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility for an additional description of the revolving credit facility see note 3 in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

equity price risk 

equity investments 

we have a portfolio of equity investments that includes marketable equity securities and nonmarketable investments our equity investments are made primarily in connection with our strategic investment program under our strategic investment program from time to time we make cash investments in companies with technologies that are potentially strategically important to us see note 8 in the notes to consolidated financial statements for an additional description of these investments

our logic design offering is comprised of logic synthesis test and equivalence checking capabilities and is typically used by customers to create and verify designs in conjunction with our functional verification capabilities the offering includes the genus ™ synthesis solution a logic synthesis offering that provides fast throughput while also offering high quality results and the joules ™ rtl power solution which delivers fast power analysis while preserving nearsignoff accuracy we also offer the modus software solution which reduces soc designfortest “dft” time 

our physical implementation offering comprises tools used near the end of the design process including place and route optimization and multipatterning preparation the innovus ™ implementation system is a physical implementation offering that delivers fast design turnaround time while also delivering improved ppa characteristics this offering enables customers to address the technology challenges of the latest semiconductor advancedprocess nodes create a physical representation of logic models and prepare a design for signoff 

our signoff offering is comprised of tools used to sign off the design as ready for manufacture by a semiconductor foundry which provides certification for this step this offering includes the tempus ™ timing signoff solution voltus ™ power integrity solution quantus ™ extraction solution and pegasus ™ physical verification system our designformanufacturing “dfm” products are also included in our signoff offering and are used by customers to address manufacturing and yield issues as early in the product development process as possible 

functional verification 

functional verification products are used by our customers to effectively and efficiently verify that the circuitry or the software they have designed is consistent with the functional specification verification is largely done throughout the design process with the objective of identifying as many potential functional problems as possible before manufacturing the circuitry thereby significantly reducing the risk of discovering a costly error in the completed product 

our verification suite ™ includes four primary verification engines starting with the jaspergold ® formal verification platform and xcelium ™ parallel logic simulation platform which are used in the early stages of design verification often at the ip and subsystem level once the design is more mature with early formal and simulation verification tasks performed verification engineers deploy our palladium ® enterprise emulation platform and protium ™ fpgabased prototyping platforms for more comprehensive chip verification often running lowlevel embedded software on top of a model of the chip to ensure proper functionality before silicon manufacturing 

these engines are used for early bug detection verification of blocklevel functionality verification acceleration and emulation of systemlevel functionality systemlevel power exploration analysis and optimization and systemlevel prototyping for hardwaresoftware coverification the palladium z1 platform provides high throughput capacity data center reliability and workgroup productivity to enable global design teams to develop advanced hardwaresoftware systems the protium platform leverages a common front end with the palladium environment to move designs rapidly from emulation to the prototyping stage allowing for software development to start weeks to months earlier than otherwise possible 

these engines are also supported by other verification tools that provide an environment that allows for effective verification throughput and management including verification planning and metric tracking testbench automation debugging and softwaredriven tests enabling our customers to coordinate verification activities across multiple verification engines and teams and locations for effective verification closure 

ip 

our ip offerings consist of preverified customizable functional blocks which customers integrate into their ics to accelerate the development process and to reduce the risk of errors in the design process we offer many types of ip including tensilica ® configurable digital signal processors “dsps” vertically targeted subsystems for ai audiovoice baseband and visionimaging applications controllers and physical interfaces for standard protocols and analog ip we have significantly expanded our design ip portfolio in recent years through acquisitions and internal development providing solutions for high speed serdes pci usb and many other standards

 item 1a risk factors 

our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties including those described in the sections below that could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations cash flows and the trading price of our common stock 

business and operational risks 

the ongoing covid19 pandemic could continue to adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

while we are unable to accurately predict the full impact that the covid19 pandemic will have on our results of operations financial condition liquidity and cash flows due to numerous uncertainties including the duration and severity of the pandemic and containment measures our compliance with these measures has impacted our daytoday operations and could disrupt our business and operations as well as that of our key customers suppliers including contract manufacturers and other counterparties for an indefinite period of time to support the health and wellbeing of our employees customers partners and communities a vast majority of our employees are still working remotely as of february 22 2021 

the disruptions to our operations caused by covid19 may result in inefficiencies delays and additional costs in our product development sales marketing and customer service efforts that we cannot fully mitigate through remote or other alternative work arrangements in addition we have experienced and may continue to experience some volatility in our hardware product delivery times due to delays in obtaining access to customer sites moreover access by our employees to our laboratory facilities that are necessary for the development of certain ip products has been and may in the future be disrupted due to local conditions 

more generally the pandemic raises the possibility of an extended global economic downturn and has caused volatility in financial markets which could affect demand for our products and services and impact our results and financial condition even after the pandemic is contained shelterinplace orders are lifted and local conditions improve for example we may be unable to collect receivables from those customers significantly impacted by covid19 and in fact have received numerous requests from our customers to delay their payments to us while we continue to provide services to these customers also a decrease in orders in a given period could negatively affect our revenues in future periods particularly if experienced on a sustained basis because a substantial proportion of our software licenses yield revenue recognized over time the pandemic may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this “risk factors” section including risks associated with our customers and supply chain we will continue to evaluate the nature and extent of the impact of covid19 to our business 

although we expect that current cash and cash equivalent balances cash flows that are generated from operations and cash borrowings available under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to meet our domestic and international working capital needs and other capital and liquidity requirements for at least the next 12 months if our access to capital is restricted or our borrowing costs increase due to the pandemic our operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted 

we have experienced varied operating results and our operating results for any particular fiscal period are affected by the timing of revenue recognition particularly for our emulation and prototyping hardware and ip products 

various factors affect our operating results and some of them are not within our control our operating results for any period are affected by the mix of products and services sold in a given period and the timing of revenue recognition particularly for our emulation and prototyping hardware and ip products in addition we have recorded net losses in the past and may record net losses in the future also our cash flows from operating activities have and will continue to fluctuate due to a number of factors including the timing of our billings collections disbursements and tax payments 

a substantial portion of the product revenue related to our hardware business and our ip offerings is recognized upon delivery and our forecasted revenue results are based in part on our expectations of hardware and ip to be delivered in a particular quarter therefore changes in hardware and ip bookings or deliveries including disruptions caused by covid19 relative to expectations will have a more immediate impact on our revenue than changes in software or services bookings for which revenue is generally recognized over time 

in recent years we made significant investments to expand our ip offerings through among other things research and development and acquisitions as we continue to expand our ip offerings a portion of the revenue related to our ip bookings will be deferred until we complete and deliver the licensed ip to our customers as a result costs related to the research and development of the ip may be incurred prior to the recognition of the related revenue 

revenue related to our hardware and ip products is inherently difficult to predict because sales of our hardware and ip products depend on the commencement of new projects for the design and development of complex ics and systems by our customers our customers’ willingness to expend capital to deploy our new and existing hardware or ip products in those projects and the availability of our new and existing hardware or ip products for delivery therefore our hardware or ip sales may be delayed or may decrease if our customers delay or cancel projects because their spending is constrained or if there are problems or delays with the supply delivery or installation of our hardware or ip products or our hardware suppliers moreover the hardware and ip markets are highly competitive and our customers may choose to purchase a competitor’s hardware or ip product based on cost performance or other factors these factors may result in lower revenue which would have an adverse effect on our business results of operations or cash flows 

a substantial proportion of our software licenses yield revenue recognized over time which may make it difficult for us to rapidly increase our revenue in future fiscal periods and means that a decrease in orders in a given period would negatively affect our revenues in future periods 

we plan our operating expenses based on forecasted revenue expected business needs and other factors these expenses and the effect of longterm commitments are relatively fixed in the short term bookings and the related revenue are harder to forecast in a difficult economic environment if we experience a shortfall in bookings our operating results could differ from our expectations because we may not be able to quickly reduce our expenses in response to shortterm business changes 

the methods estimates and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies have a significant impact on our results of operations see “critical accounting estimates” under part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” such methods estimates and judgments are by their nature subject to substantial risks uncertainties and assumptions and factors may arise over time that may lead us to change our methods estimates and judgments changes in those methods estimates and judgments could significantly affect our results of operations 

historical results of operations should not be viewed as reliable indicators of our future performance if our revenue operating results or business outlook for future periods fall short of the levels expected by us securities analysts or investors the trading price of our common stock could decline 

any periods of uncertainty in the global economy and international trade relations changes in governmental policies relating to technology and any potential downturn in the semiconductor and electronics industries may negatively impact our business and reduce our bookings levels and revenue 

purchases of our products and services are dependent upon the commencement of new design projects by ic manufacturers and electronics systems companies the ic and electronics systems industries are cyclical and are characterized by constant and rapid technological change rapid product obsolescence and price erosion evolving standards short product life cycles and wide fluctuations in product supply and demand 

the ic and electronics systems industries have also experienced significant downturns in connection with or in anticipation of maturing product cycles of both these industries’ and their customers’ products spending on our products and services has grown in recent years but the current outlook for the global economy is uncertain and may result in a decrease in spending on our products and services 

uncertainty about future political and economic conditions adverse changes to international trade relationships between countries in which we do business or future decline in corporate or consumer spending could negatively impact our customers’ businesses reducing the number of new chip designs and their overall research and development spending including their spending on our products and services and as a result decrease demand for our products and services decreased bookings for our products and services customer bankruptcies consolidation among our customers or problems or delays with our hardware suppliers or with the supply or delivery of our hardware products could also adversely affect our ability to grow our business or adversely affect our future revenues and financial results our future business and financial results including demand for our products and services are subject to considerable uncertainty that could impact our stock price if economic conditions or international trade relationships between countries in which we do business deteriorate in the future or in particular if semiconductor or electronics systems industry revenues do not grow the ability to export or import products or services by the semiconductor or electronics systems industry is adversely restricted or our supplies of hardware components and products are subject to problems or delays our future revenues and financial results could be adversely affected 

in fiscal 2019 and 2020 the bureau of industry and security “bis” of the us department of commerce placed certain entities who are our customers on the “entity list” limiting our ability to deliver products and services to these entities when certain customers are on the entity list or are subject to new or expanded trade restrictions such as the expansion of the scope of military endusers and military enduse by bis in april 2020 and the foreignproduced direct product rules in august 2020 and in the absence of a license from the bis it will have a negative effect on our ability to sell products and provide services to these customers in addition new or expanded trade restrictions such as the expansion of the military enduser military enduse rule and the foreignproduced direct product rules will increase our costs or expenses entity list restrictions and other trade restrictions will also encourage customers to seek substitute products from our competitors that are not subject to these restrictions or to develop their own solutions thereby decreasing our longterm competitiveness in addition although customers are not prohibited from paying and we are not restricted from collecting for products we previously delivered to them the credit risks associated with outstanding receivables from customers on the entity list and other trade restrictions could increase as a result of these limitations in particular china’s stated national policy to be a global leader in all segments of the semiconductor industry by 2030 has resulted in and may continue to cause increased competitive capability in china 

we cannot predict whether or when any changes will be made that eliminate or decrease these limitations on our ability to sell products and provide services to these entity list customers or other customers impacted by other trade restrictions we are unable to predict the duration of the export restrictions imposed with respect to any particular customer or the longterm effects on our business or our customers’ business additionally other companies may be added to the entity list andor be subject to new or expanded trade restrictions in addition there may be indirect impacts to our business which we cannot reasonably quantify including that our business may also be impacted by other trade restrictions that may be imposed by the us china or other countries restrictions on our ability to sell and ship our products to customers on the entity list have had and may continue to have an adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition  

we have acquired and expect to acquire other companies and businesses and may not realize the expected benefits of these acquisitions 

we have acquired and expect to acquire other companies and businesses in order to expand our product offerings and enter into new markets our future revenue growth and expansion of our business is dependent on our successful integration of our acquisitions we may incur significant costs in connection with potential transactions including acquisitions that are not consummated potential and completed acquisitions involve a number of risks if any of the following acquisitionrelated risks occur our business operating results or financial condition could be adversely impacted 

• the failure to realize or a delay in realizing anticipated benefits such as cost savings and revenue enhancements 

• overlapping customers and product sets that impact our ability to maintain revenue at historical rates 

• the failure to understand compete and operate effectively in markets where we have limited experience 

• the failure to integrate and manage acquired products technologies and businesses effectively 

• difficulties in integrating employees of an acquired company or business and the failure to retain key employees 

• difficulties in combining previously separate companies or businesses into a single unit 

• the substantial diversion of management’s attention from daytoday business when evaluating and negotiating these transactions and integrating an acquired company or business 

• the discovery of unanticipated liabilities assumed from an acquired company business or assets such that we cannot realize the anticipated value of the acquisition 

• difficulties related to integrating the products and infrastructure of an acquired company or business in for example distribution engineering licensing models or customer support areas 

• incurring costs to remediate issues of an acquired company discovered during due diligence or thereafter 

• unanticipated costs or 

• unwillingness of customers of an acquired business to continue licensing or buying products from us following the acquisition 

in a number of our completed acquisitions we have agreed to make future payments either in the form of employee retention bonuses or contingent purchase price payments based on the achievement of specified milestones the performance goals pursuant to which these future payments may be made generally relate to the achievement by the acquired company or business or by the employees who joined us with the acquired company or business of certain specified bookings revenue run rate product proliferation product development or employee retention goals during a specified period following completion of the applicable acquisition the specific performance goal levels and amounts and timing of employee bonuses or contingent purchase price payments vary with each acquisition we may continue to use contingent payments in connection with acquisitions in the future and while we expect to derive value from an acquisition in excess of such contingent payment obligations we may be required to make certain contingent payments without deriving the anticipated value 

future acquisitions may involve issuances of stock as full or partial payment of the purchase price for the acquired company or business grants of restricted stock restricted stock units or stock options to employees of the acquired companies or businesses which may be dilutive to existing stockholders expenditure of substantial cash resources or the incurrence of a material amount of debt these arrangements may impact our liquidity financial position and results of operations or increase dilution of our stockholders’ equity interests in the company 

we make and expect to make strategic investments and may not realize the expected benefits of these investments 

we have made and expect to make strategic investments in which we have a minority equity interest and do not have operational control these strategic investments may also involve collaboration agreements that further and complement our strategy and marketing efforts we may not be able to realize the expected benefits of these investments and the related collaborations may be difficult to manage without sole decisionmaking authority and the economic or business interests in these collaborations may become inconsistent with our interests these challenges could have an adverse effect on our business operating results or financial condition 

the accounting applied to strategic investments depends on a number of factors including but not limited to our percentage of ownership and the level of our influence over the entity losses experienced by these strategic investment entities or associated impairment charges could adversely impact our operating results and the value of our investment in addition if these entities fail and cease operations we may lose the value of our investment and shared profits 

failure to obtain export licenses or restrictions on trade imposed by the united states or other countries could harm our business by rendering us unable to sell or ship products and transfer our technology outside of the united states 

we must comply with regulations of the united states and of certain other countries in selling or shipping our products and transferring our technology outside the united states and to foreign nationals changes in these regulations or restrictions due to changes in trade relationships with the united states including new tariffs trade protection measures import or export licensing requirements sanctions trade embargoes and other trade barriers could harm our business operating results or financial condition 

the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations may adversely impact our revenue expenses cash flows and financial condition 

we have significant operations outside the united states our revenue from international operations as a percentage of total revenue was approximately 59 during fiscal 2020 58 during fiscal 2019 and 57 during fiscal 2018 we expect that revenue from our international operations will continue to account for a significant portion of our total revenue we also transact business in various foreign currencies although the majority of our revenue contracts worldwide are denominated in us dollars volatility of currencies in countries where we conduct business most notably the us dollar chinese renminbi japanese yen european union euro british pound and indian rupee have had and may in the future have an effect on our revenue or operating results 

fluctuations in the rate of exchange between the us dollar and the currencies of other countries where we conduct business could seriously affect our business operating results or financial condition for example if we price our products and services in a foreign currency we receive fewer us dollars when this currency declines in value relative to the us dollar if we price our products and services in us dollars the decrease in value of a local currency results in an increase in the price for our products and services compared to those products of our competitors that are priced in this currency this could result in our prices being uncompetitive in markets where business is transacted in the local currency on the other hand when a foreign currency increases in value relative to the us dollar it takes more us dollars to purchase the same amount of the foreign currency as we use the foreign currency to fund payroll costs and other operating expenses in our international operations this results in an increase in operating expenses approximately 30 of our total costs and expenses are transacted in foreign currencies our attempts to reduce the effect of foreign currency fluctuations may be unsuccessful and significant exchange rate movements may adversely impact our results of operations as expressed in us dollars 

we could suffer serious harm to our business because of the infringement of our intellectual property rights by third parties or because of our infringement of the intellectual property rights of third parties as well as any associated efforts to enforce such rights including through intellectual property litigation 

there are numerous patents relating to our business and ecosystem new patents are being issued at a rapid rate and are owned by computational software companies as well as entities and individuals outside the computational software field including parties whose income is primarily derived from infringementrelated licensing and litigation it is not always practicable to determine in advance whether a product or any of its components infringes the patent rights of others as a result from time to time we may be compelled to respond to or prosecute intellectual property infringement claims to protect our rights or defend a customer’s rights  

intellectual property infringement claims including contractual defense reimbursement obligations related to thirdparty claims against our customers regardless of merit could consume valuable management time result in costly litigation or cause product shipment delays all of which could seriously harm our business operating results or financial condition the risk of infringement and related indemnification claims associated with design ip products that are incorporated into a customer product broadly used by consumers may be higher than the risk associated with our software products in settling these claims we may be required to enter into royalty or licensing agreements with the third parties claiming infringement these royalty or licensing agreements if available may not have terms favorable to us being compelled to enter into a license agreement with unfavorable terms could seriously harm our business operating results or financial condition 

any potential intellectual property litigation could compel us to do one or more of the following 

• pay damages including the potential for treble damages license fees or royalties including royalties for past periods 

• stop licensing products or providing services that use the challenged intellectual property 

• obtain a license to sell or use the relevant technology which license may not be available on reasonable terms or at all or 

• redesign the challenged technology which could be time consuming and costly or impossible 

if we were compelled to take any of these actions our business reputation or operating results might suffer 

if our security measures are breached or vulnerabilities are discovered in our products and services and an unauthorized party obtains access to customer data financial data or assets or our proprietary business information our information systems and products and services may be perceived as being unsecure we could experience business or financial harm and our business and reputation could be harmed 

our products and services involve storage including cloudbased storage and transmission of our proprietary information and that of our customers our operations are dependent upon the connectivity of our operations throughout the world despite our security measures our information technology and infrastructure as well as our products and services may be vulnerable to cyber attacks by unauthorized third parties which may include nationstates and individuals sponsored by them or breaches due to employee error malfeasance or other vulnerabilities or disruptions which could result in unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information and could significantly interfere with our business operations or those of our customers third parties attempt to gain unauthorized access through a variety of methods such as the use of viruses malware ransomware phishing denial of service attacks and other cyber attacks and corrupt the processes of the products and services that we provide we may also be a target of malicious attacks in an attempt to gain access to our network including our cadence cloud portfolio which includes both our managed and customermanaged environments or data centers or those of our customers or end users steal proprietary information related to our business products services or infrastructure steal financial data or assets or interrupt our systems and services or those of our customers or others breaches of our security measures or vulnerabilities in our products or services could expose us to a risk of loss or misuse of this information loss of financial assets business interruption litigation and potential liability because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage information systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventive measures furthermore we have and may continue to acquire companies with less sophisticated security measures and that have had or may experience in the future cybersecurity incidents causing business or financial harm in addition if we select a vendor that uses cloud storage of information as part of their service or product offerings or are selected as a vendor for our cadence cloud portfolio despite our attempts to validate the security of such services our proprietary information may be misappropriated by third parties in the event of an actual or perceived breach of our security or the security of one of our vendors the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed legal or regulatory actions could be initiated against us and we could suffer damage to our reputation or our business or lose existing customers and our ability to obtain new customers including government customers or suffer harm to our financial condition 

risks associated with our international operations could adversely impact our financial condition 

a significant amount of our revenue is derived from our international operations and we have offices throughout the world including key research and development facilities outside of the united states our international operations may be subject to a number of risks including 

• government trade restrictions including tariffs export or import regulations sanctions or other trade barriers including licensing requirements for exports which may lengthen the sales cycle or restrict or prohibit the sale or licensing of certain products 

• limitations on repatriation of earnings and on the conversion of foreign currencies 

• reduced protection of intellectual property rights and heightened exposure to intellectual property theft 

• longer collection periods for receivables and greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable 

• difficulties in managing foreign operations 

• political and economic instability 

• unexpected changes in regulatory requirements 

• inability to continue to offer competitive compensation in certain growing regions 

• differing employment practices and labor issues 

• united states’ and other governments’ licensing requirements for exports which may lengthen the sales cycle or restrict or prohibit the sale or licensing of certain products 

• variations in costs or expenses associated with our international operations including as a result of changes in foreign tax laws or devaluation of the us dollar relative to other foreign currencies and 

• public health emergencies such as the recent covid19 pandemic and the subsequent public health measures including restrictions on travel between jurisdictions in which we and our customers and suppliers operate 

some of our international research and development and other facilities are in parts of the world where there may be a greater risk of business interruption as a result of political instability terrorist acts or military conflicts than businesses located domestically furthermore this potential harm is exacerbated because damage to or disruptions at our international research and development facilities could have a more significant adverse effect on our ability to develop new or improve existing products than other businesses that may only have sales offices or other less critical operations abroad we are not insured for losses or interruptions caused by acts of war furthermore our operations are dependent upon the connectivity of our operations throughout the world activities that interfere with our international connectivity or operations such as cyber hacking the introduction of a virus into our computer systems natural disasters public health emergencies civil unrest or terrorism could significantly interfere with our business operations 

in addition internal controls policies and procedures and employee training and compliance programs that we have implemented to deter prohibited practices may not prevent our employees contractors or agents from violating or circumventing our policies and the laws and regulations applicable to our worldwide operations 

we depend upon our management team and key employees and our failure to attract train motivate and retain management and key employees may make us less competitive and therefore harm our results of operations 

our business depends upon the continued services efforts and abilities of our senior management and other key employees competition for highly skilled executive officers and employees can be intense particularly in geographic areas recognized as high technology centers where we maintain facilities in addition competition for qualified personnel including software engineers in the eda commercial electronics engineering services and ip industries has intensified further increased uncertainty regarding social political and immigration policies in the united states and abroad may make it difficult to recruit employees with adequate experience and governmental policies resulting in increased funding of domestic technology companies such as china’s stated national policy to be a global leader in all segments of the semiconductor industry by 2030 has caused and may continue to cause difficulty in retaining and attracting local talent we may also experience increased compensation costs that are not offset by either improved productivity or higher sales we may not be successful in recruiting new personnel and in training retaining and motivating existing personnel our ability to do so also depends on how well we maintain a strong workplace culture that is attractive to employees and hiring and training of new employees may be adversely impacted by global economic uncertainty and office closures from time to time there may be changes in our management team resulting from the hiring and departure of executive officers and as a result we may experience disruption to our business that may harm our operating results and our relationships with our employees customers and suppliers may be adversely affected 

to attract retain and motivate individuals with the requisite expertise we may be required to grant large numbers of stock options or other stockbased incentive awards which may be dilutive to existing stockholders and increase compensation expense and pay significant base salaries and cash bonuses which could harm our operating results the high cost of training new employees not fully utilizing these employees or losing trained employees to competing employers could also reduce our operating margins and harm our business or operating results 

we rely on our proprietary technology as well as software and other intellectual property rights licensed to us by third parties and we cannot assure that the precautions taken to protect our rights will be adequate or that we will continue to be able to adequately secure such intellectual property rights from third parties 

our success depends in part upon our proprietary technology we generally rely on patents copyrights trademarks trade secrets licenses and restrictive agreements to establish and protect our proprietary rights in technology and products despite the precautions we may take to protect our intellectual property third parties have tried in the past and may try in the future to challenge invalidate or circumvent these safeguards our patents and other intellectual property rights may not provide us with sufficient competitive advantages patents may not be issued on any of our pending applications and our issued patents may not be sufficiently broad to protect our technology furthermore the laws of foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights in those countries to the same extent as applicable law protects these rights in the united states and we may encounter difficulties in our attempts to protect our intellectual property in foreign jurisdictions including as a result of impacts from changes in international trade relationships the protection of our intellectual property may require the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources moreover the steps we take to protect our intellectual property may not adequately protect our rights or deter or prevent third parties from infringing or misappropriating our proprietary rights 

many of our products include software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties we may have to seek new or renew existing licenses for such software and other intellectual property in the future our engineering services business holds licenses to certain software and other intellectual property owned by third parties including that of our competitors our failure to obtain software other intellectual property licenses or other intellectual property rights that are necessary or helpful for our business on favorable terms or our need to engage in litigation over these licenses or rights could seriously harm our business operating results or financial condition 

we have substantial cash requirements in the united states but a significant portion of our cash is held and generated outside of the united states and if our cash available in the united states is insufficient to meet our operating expenses and debt repayment obligations in the united states then we may be required to raise cash in ways that could negatively affect our financial condition results of operations and the market price of our common stock 

we have significant operations outside the united states as of january 2 2021 approximately 61 of our cash and cash equivalents balance was held by subsidiaries outside the united states with the remainder of the balance held by us or our subsidiaries in the united states while we believe that the combination of our current us cash and cash equivalents future us operating cash flows and other cash that may be accessible to us on attractive terms are sufficient to meet our ongoing us operating expenses and debt repayment obligations we cannot accurately predict the full impact that covid19 may have on our cash flows including our ability to borrow under our revolving credit facility in addition although the us tax cuts and jobs act the “tax act” may have reduced the tax impact of repatriation of foreign earnings there are still administrative processes associated with repatriation of foreign earnings that could affect the timing of returning cash to the us from nonus jurisdictions accordingly if our us cash were insufficient to meet our future funding obligations in the united states we could be required to seek funding sources on less attractive terms which could negatively impact our results of operations financial position and the market price of our common stock 

the long sales cycle of our products and services may cause our operating results to fluctuate unexpectedly 

generally we have a long sales cycle that can extend up to six months or longer the complexity and expense associated with our products and services generally require a lengthy customer education evaluation and approval process consequently we may incur substantial expenses and devote significant management effort and expense to develop potential relationships that do not result in agreements or revenue and may prevent us from pursuing other opportunities 

in addition sales of our products and services have been and may in the future be delayed if customers delay approval or commencement of projects because of 

• the timing of customers’ competitive evaluation processes or 

• customers’ budgetary constraints and budget cycles 

long sales cycles for hardware products subject us to a number of significant risks over which we have limited control including insufficient excess or obsolete inventory variations in inventory valuation and fluctuations in quarterly operating results 

our restructuring plans incur substantial costs and may not result in the benefits we have anticipated possibly having a negative effect on our future operating results 

in recent fiscal years we have initiated restructuring plans in an effort to reallocate or decrease costs by reducing our workforce and by consolidating facilities we incur substantial costs to implement restructuring plans and our restructuring activities may subject us to reputational risks and litigation risks and expenses our past restructuring plans do not provide any assurance that we will realize anticipated cost savings and other benefits or that additional restructuring plans will not be required or implemented in the future in addition our restructuring plans may have other consequences such as attrition beyond our planned reduction in workforce a negative effect on employee morale and productivity or our ability to attract highly skilled employees our competitors may also use our restructuring plans to seek to gain a competitive advantage over us as a result our restructuring plans may affect our revenue and other operating results in the future 

the investment of our cash is subject to risks that may cause losses and affect the liquidity of these investments 

our marketable investments include various money market funds and may include other investments as well weakened financial markets have at times adversely impacted the general credit liquidity market prices and interest rates for these and other types of investments additionally changes in monetary policy by the federal open market committee or other relevant regulators and concerns about the rising us government debt level may cause a decrease in the purchasing power of the us dollar and adversely affect our investment portfolio the financial market and monetary risks associated with our investment portfolio may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition liquidity results of operations or cash flows 

our business is subject to the risk of earthquakes and other catastrophic events 

our corporate headquarters including certain of our research and development operations and certain of our distribution facilities is located in the silicon valley area of northern california a region known to experience seismic activity and wildfires if significant seismic activity or wildfires were to occur or reoccur our operations may be interrupted which could adversely impact our business and results of operations 

our offices in the united states and in other countries around the world may also be adversely impacted by natural disasters including fires earthquakes flooding and other climate changerelated risks or actions by utility providers as well as other catastrophic events such as an actual or threatened public health emergency if a catastrophic event occurs at or near any of our offices or utility providers or public health officials take certain actions eg shut off power to our facilities or impose travel restrictions our operations may be interrupted which could adversely impact our business and results of operations if a catastrophic event impacts a significant number of our customers resulting in decreased demand for their and our products or our ability to provide services and maintenance to our customers our business and results of operations could be adversely impacted 

risks related to customers suppliers and industry competition 

customer consolidation could affect our operating results 

there has been a trend toward customer consolidation in the semiconductor industry through business combinations including mergers asset acquisitions and strategic partnerships if this trend continues it could make us more dependent on fewer customers who may be able to exert increased pressure on our prices and other contract terms and could increase the portion of our total sales concentration for any single customer customer consolidation activity could also reduce the demand for our products and services if such customers streamline research and development or operations reduce purchases or delay purchasing decisions these outcomes could negatively impact our operating results and financial condition 

our failure to respond quickly to technological developments or customers’ increasing technological requirements and to continue to develop or acquire technological capabilities could make our products uncompetitive and obsolete and impede our ability to address the requirements in technology segments that are expected to contribute to our growth 

our strategy is designed to increase our business among electronic systems companies which are now developing their own ics and other electronic subsystems our strategy is also intended to increase our business among semiconductor companies which are increasing their contribution to the end products into which their ics and other electronic subsystems are incorporated part of this strategy involves addressing the needs of new categories of electronic systems including hyperscale computing and infrastructure edge computing machine learning 5g networks arvr iot aerospace and defense and autonomous vehicle subsystems where increased investment is expected by our customers each of these categories requires technologies expertise and marketing and operations infrastructure that are applicationspecific our inability to develop or acquire these applicationspecific capabilities it could impede our ability to expand our business in these categories and ultimately affect our future growth currently the industries we serve are experiencing the following trends 

• changes in the design and manufacturing of ics including migration to advancedprocess nodes and threedimensional transistors such as finfets present major challenges to the semiconductor industry particularly in ic design design automation design of manufacturing equipment and the manufacturing process itself with migration to advancedprocess nodes the industry must adapt to more complex physics and manufacturing challenges such as the need to draw features on silicon that are many times smaller than the wavelength of light used to draw the features via lithography models of each component’s electrical properties and behavior also become more complex as do requisite analysis design verification and manufacturing capabilities novel design tools and methodologies must be invented and enhanced quickly to remain competitive in the design of electronics in the smallest nanometer ranges 

• the ability to design socs increases the complexity of managing a design that at the lowest level is represented by billions of shapes on fabrication masks in addition socs typically incorporate microprocessors and dsps that are programmed with software requiring simultaneous design of the ic and the related software embedded on the ic 

• with the availability of seemingly endless gate capacity there is an increase in design reuse or the combining of offtheshelf design ip with custom logic to create ics or socs the unavailability of a broad range of highquality design ip including our own that can be reliably incorporated into a customer’s design with our software products and services could lead to reduced demand for our products and services 

• increased technological capability of the fpga logic chip which creates an alternative to ic implementation for some companies and could reduce demand for our ic implementation products and services 

• a growing number of lowcost engineering service businesses could reduce the need for some ic companies to invest in eda products 

• adoption of cloud computing technologies with accompanying new engagement models for an increasing number of software categories may impact our business 

• integration and optimization of solutions for system design with core eda technologies could result in reduced demand for our broad portfolio 

• with moores law slowing the trend towards onchip integration could change the required product mix and impact the need for systemonchip integration and 

• changing enduser dynamics in our eight target technology verticals  consumer hyperscale computing mobile 5g communications automotive aerospace and defense industrial and healthcare  could advance the need from simple ics to fullsystem design and analysis capabilities that require increasingly complex computational softwarebased solutions 

if we are unable to respond quickly and successfully to these trends we may lose our competitive position and our products or technologies may become obsolete to compete successfully we must develop acquire or license new products and improve our existing products and processes on a schedule that keeps pace with technological developments and the requirements for products addressing a broad spectrum of designers and designer expertise in our industries we must provide frequent and relevant updates to our software products in order to provide substantial benefit to the customer throughout the license periods because of the rapid changes in our customers’ industries the market must also accept our new and improved products our hardware platforms must be enhanced periodically to reduce the likelihood that a competitor surpasses the capabilities we offer our introduction of new products could reduce the demand and revenue of our older products or affect their pricing we must also be able to support a range of changing computer software hardware platforms and customer preferences a transition by our customers to different business models associated with cloud computing technologies could result in reduced revenue we cannot guarantee that we will be successful in keeping pace with all or any of the customer trends 

we have invested and expect to continue to invest in research and development efforts for new and existing products and technologies and technical sales support such investments may affect our operating results and if the return on these investments is lower or develops more slowly than we expect our revenue and operating results may suffer 

we have invested and expect to continue to invest in research and development for new and existing products technologies and services in response to our customers’ increasing technological requirements such investments may be in related areas such as technical sales support and may include increases in employee headcount these investments may involve significant time risks and uncertainties including the risk that the expenses associated with these investments may affect our margins and operating results and that such investments may not generate sufficient revenues to offset liabilities assumed and expenses associated with these new investments we believe that we must continue to invest a significant amount of time and resources in our research and development efforts and technical sales support to maintain and improve our competitive position if we do not achieve the benefits anticipated from these investments if the achievement of these benefits is delayed or if customers reduce or slow the need to upgrade or enhance their computational software products and design flows our revenue and operating results may be adversely affected 

our operating results and revenue could be adversely affected by customer payment delays customer bankruptcies and defaults or modifications of licenses 

if our customers face challenging financial or operating conditions including due to macroeconomic conditions or catastrophic events such as the covid19 pandemic they may delay or default on their payment commitments to us request to modify contract terms or modify or cancel plans to license our products our customers’ inability to fulfill payment commitments in turn may adversely affect our revenue operating expenses and cash flow additionally our customers have in the past sought and may in the future seek to renegotiate preexisting contractual commitments payment defaults by our customers or significant reductions in existing contractual commitments could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results 

competitive pressures may require us to reduce our pricing which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

the highly competitive markets in which we do business can put pressure on us to reduce the prices of our software emulation and prototyping hardware and ip if our competitors offer significant discounts on certain products in an effort to recapture or gain market share or to sell other software or hardware products we may then need to lower our prices or offer other favorable terms to compete successfully any such changes would be likely to reduce our profit margins and could adversely affect our operating results any substantial changes to our prices and pricing policies could cause revenues to decline or be delayed as our sales force implements and our customers adjust to the new pricing policies some of our competitors bundle products for promotional purposes or as a longterm pricing strategy or provide guarantees of prices and product implementations these practices could over time significantly constrain the prices that we can charge for our products 

the competition in our industries is substantial and we may not be able to continue to compete successfully in our industries 

the industries in which we do business including software hardware ip and services for enabling the design of electronic products are highly competitive and require us to identify and develop or acquire innovative and costcompetitive products integrate them into platforms and market them in a timely manner we may not be able to compete successfully in these industries which could seriously harm our business operating results or financial condition factors that could affect our ability to compete successfully include 

• the development by others of competitive products or platforms and engineering services possibly resulting in a shift of customer preferences away from our products and services and significantly decreased revenue 

• aggressive pricing competition by some of our competitors may cause us to lose our competitive position which could result in lower revenues or profitability and could adversely impact our ability to realize the revenue and profitability forecasts for our software or emulation and prototyping hardware systems products 

• the challenges of advancednode design may lead some customers to work with more mature less risky manufacturing processes that may reduce their need to upgrade or enhance their eda products and design flows 

• the challenges of developing or acquiring externally developed technology solutions that are adequate and competitive in meeting the rapidly evolving requirements of nextgeneration design challenges 

• intense competition to attract acquisition targets possibly making it more difficult for us to acquire companies or technologies at an acceptable price or at all 

• new entrants including larger electronic systems companies in our business 

• the combination of our competitors or collaboration among many companies to deliver more comprehensive offerings than they could individually 

• decisions by electronics manufacturers to perform engineering services or ip development internally rather than purchase these services from outside vendors due to budget constraints or excess engineering capacity and 

• actions by regulators to limit the contractual terms that either we or our customers can apply to product and service offerings 

we compete most frequently with synopsys inc siemens eda and ansys inc and also with numerous other tools providers electronics device manufacturers with their own eda capabilities technical or computational software companies electronics design and consulting companies and other ip companies these include us based companies such as keysight technologies inc and ceva inc and foreign companies such as altium limited australia zuken ltd japan and emerging competitors in china like huada empyrean xpeedic xepic primarius and gigada 

our future revenue is dependent in part upon our installed customer base continuing to license or buy products and purchase services 

our installed customer base has traditionally generated additional new license services and maintenance revenues in future periods customers may not necessarily license or buy additional products or contract for additional services or maintenance our customers many of which are large semiconductor and systems companies often have significant bargaining power in negotiations with us customer consolidation can reduce the total level of purchases of our software hardware ip and services and in some cases increase customers’ bargaining power in negotiations with their suppliers including us  

we depend on a single supplier or a limited number of suppliers for certain hardware components and contract manufacturers for production of our emulation and prototyping hardware products making us vulnerable to supply disruption and price fluctuation 

our reliance on single or a limited number of suppliers and contract manufacturers for certain hardware components and contract manufacturers for production of our emulation and prototyping hardware products could result in product delivery problems and delays and reduced control over product pricing and quality though we prefer to have multiple sources to procure certain key components in some cases it is not practical or feasible to do so we may suffer a disruption in the supply of certain hardware components if we are unable to purchase sufficient components on a timely basis or at all for any reason any supply or manufacturing disruption including delay in delivery of components by our suppliers or products by our manufacturers or the bankruptcy or shutdown of our suppliers or manufacturers could delay our production process and prevent us from delivering completed hardware products to customers or from supplying new evaluation units to customers which could have a negative impact on our revenue and operating results 

tax regulatory and litigation risks 

our results could be adversely affected by an increase in our effective tax rate as a result of us and foreign tax law changes outcomes of current or future tax examinations or by material differences between our forecasted and actual effective tax rates 

tax laws regulations and administrative practices in various jurisdictions are evolving and may be subject to significant changes due to economic political and other conditions including the fiscal impacts caused by the covid19 pandemic governments including the united states are increasingly focused on ways to increase tax revenues particularly from multinational corporations which may lead to changes in tax laws an increase in audit activity and harsher positions taken by tax authorities we are currently subject to tax audits in various jurisdictions and these jurisdictions may assess additional tax liabilities against us 

our operations are subject to income and transaction taxes in the united states and in multiple foreign jurisdictions with a significant amount of our foreign earnings generated by our subsidiaries organized in ireland and hungary any significant change in our future effective tax rates could adversely impact our results of operations cash flows and financial position our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by factors that include but are not limited to changes in tax laws or the interpretation of such tax laws in jurisdictions in which we have business activity earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions with low statutory tax rates changes in tax benefits from stockbased compensation changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities changes in our recognition or measurement of a tax position taken in a prior period increases to interest or penalty expenses new accounting standards or interpretations of such standards or results of examinations by the internal revenue service “irs” state and foreign tax or other governmental authorities 

the irs and other tax authorities regularly examine our income tax returns and other nonincome tax returns such as payroll sales use valueadded net worth or franchise property goods and services consumption import stamp and excise taxes in both the united states and foreign jurisdictions the calculation of our provision for income taxes and our accruals for other taxes requires us to use significant judgment and involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes we regularly assess the potential settlement outcomes resulting from income tax examinations however the final outcome of tax examinations cannot be estimated with certainty and could be materially different from the amount that is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals for other taxes should the irs or other tax authorities assess additional taxes penalties or interest as a result of a current or a future examination we may be required to record charges to operations in future periods that could have a material impact on our results of operations financial position or cash flows in the applicable period or periods 

the organisation for economic cooperation and development “oecd” released the final reports from its base erosion and profit shifting “beps” action plans which proposed revisions to numerous long standing tax principles the european commission “ec” and oecd have also been evaluating new rules on the taxation of the digital economy to provide greater taxing rights to jurisdictions where customers or users are located and to address additional base erosion and profits shifting issues in addition many countries have recently introduced new laws or proposals to tax digital transactions these developments in tax laws and regulations and compliance with these rules could have a material adverse effect on our operating results financial position and cash flows 

forecasts of our annual effective tax rate are complex and subject to uncertainty because our income tax position for each year combines the effects of estimating the amount and composition of our annual income or loss in jurisdictions with varying income tax rates as well as benefits from available deferred tax assets the impact of various accounting rules our interpretations of changes in tax laws and results of tax audits forecasts of our annual effective tax rate do not include the anticipation of future tax law changes in addition we account for certain tax benefits from stockbased compensation in the period the stock compensation vests or is settled which may cause increased variability in our quarterly effective tax rates if there were a material difference between forecasted and actual tax rates it could have a material impact on our results of operations 

litigation could adversely affect our financial condition or operations 

we currently are and in the future may be involved in various disputes and litigation that arise in the ordinary course of business these include disputes and lawsuits related to intellectual property including customer indemnification mergers and acquisitions licensing contracts distribution arrangements and employee relations matters for information regarding the litigation matters in which we are currently engaged please refer to the discussion under part i item 3 “legal proceedings” and note 18 in the notes to consolidated financial statements we cannot provide any assurances that the final outcome of these lawsuits or any other proceedings that may arise in the future will not have a material adverse effect on our business reputation operating results financial condition or cash flows litigation can be time consuming and expensive and could divert management’s time and attention from our business which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and operating results 

errors or defects in our products and services could expose us to liability and harm our business 

our customers use our products and services in designing and developing products that involve a high degree of technological complexity each of which has its own specifications because of the complexity of the systems and products with which we work some of our products and designs can be adequately tested only when put to full use in the marketplace as a result our customers or their end users may discover errors or defects in our software or the systems we design or the products or systems incorporating our design and intellectual property may not operate as expected errors or defects could result in 

• damage to our reputation and loss of customers and market share 

• failure to attract new customers or achieve market acceptance 

• diversion of development resources to resolve the problem 

• loss of or delay in revenue or payments and increased service costs and 

• liability for damages 

our reported financial results may be adversely affected by changes in united states generally accepted accounting principles and we may incur significant costs to adjust our accounting systems and processes to comply with significant changes  

united states generally accepted accounting principles “us gaap” are subject to interpretation by the financial accounting standards board “fasb” the sec and various bodies formed to promulgate and interpret appropriate accounting principles we are also subject to evolving rules and regulations of the countries in which we do business changes to accounting standards or interpretations thereof may result in different accounting principles under us gaap that could have a significant effect on our reported financial results 

in addition we have in the past and may in the future need to significantly change our customer contracts accounting systems and processes when we adopt future or proposed changes in accounting principles the cost and effect of these changes may negatively impact our results of operations during the periods of transition 

if we become subject to unfair hiring claims we could be prevented from hiring needed employees incur liability for damages and incur substantial costs in defending ourselves 

when companies in our industry lose employees to competitors they frequently claim that these competitors have engaged in unfair hiring practices or that the employment of these persons would involve the disclosure or use of trade secrets these claims could prevent us from hiring employees or cause us to incur liability for damages we could also incur substantial costs in defending ourselves or our employees against these claims regardless of their merits defending ourselves from these claims could also divert the attention of our management away from our operations 

we are subject to evolving corporate governance and public disclosure expectations and regulations that impact compliance costs and risks of noncompliance 

we are subject to changing rules and regulations promulgated by a number of governmental and selfregulatory organizations including the sec nasdaq and the fasb as well as evolving investor expectations around corporate governance executive compensation and environmental and social practices and disclosures these rules and regulations continue to evolve in scope and complexity and many new requirements have been created in response to laws enacted by the us and foreign governments making compliance more difficult and uncertain the increase in costs to comply with such evolving expectations rules and regulations as well as any risk of noncompliance could adversely impact us 

risks related to our securities and indebtedness 

our stock price has been subject to fluctuations and may continue to be subject to fluctuations 

our stock price is subject to changes in recommendations or earnings estimates by financial analysts changes in investors’ or analysts’ valuation measures for our stock our credit ratings and market trends unrelated to our performance furthermore speculation in the press or investment community about our strategic position financial condition results of operations business or security of our products can cause changes in our stock price in addition to these factors and industry and general economic and political conditions our stock price may be adversely impacted by announcements related to financial results or forecasts that fail to meet or are inconsistent with earlier projections or the expectations of our securities analysts or investors announcements of new products or acquisitions of new technologies by us our competitors or our customers or announcements by us of acquisitions major transaction or litigation developments or management changes a significant drop in our stock price could expose us to the risk of securities class actions lawsuits which may result in substantial costs and divert management’s attention and resources which may adversely affect our business 

antitakeover defenses in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and certain provisions under delaware law could prevent an acquisition of our company or limit the price that investors might be willing to pay for our common stock  

our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and certain provisions of the delaware general corporation law that apply to us could make it difficult for another company to acquire control of our company for example our certificate of incorporation allows our board of directors to designate and issue at any time and without stockholder approval up to 400000 shares of preferred stock in one or more series all 400000 shares of preferred stock are currently designated as series a preferred but because no such shares are outstanding or reserved for issuance our board of directors may reduce the number of shares of preferred stock designated as series a preferred to zero subject to the delaware general corporation law our board of directors may as to any shares of preferred stock the terms of which have not then been designated fix the rights preferences privileges and restrictions on these shares fix the number of shares and designation of any series and increase or decrease the number of shares of any series if not below the number of outstanding shares plus the number of shares reserved for issuance our board of directors has the power to issue shares of series a preferred with dividend voting and liquidation rights superior to our common stock at a rate of 1000to1 without further vote or action by the common stockholders 

in addition section 203 of the delaware general corporation law generally prohibits a delaware corporation from engaging in any business combination with a person owning 15 or more of its voting stock or who is affiliated with the corporation and owned 15 or more of its voting stock at any time within three years prior to the proposed business combination for a period of three years from the date the person became a 15 owner unless specified conditions are met 

all or any one of these factors could limit the price that certain investors would be willing to pay for shares of our common stock and could allow our board of directors to resist delay or prevent an acquisition of our company even if a proposed transaction were favored by a majority of our independent stockholders 

our debt obligations expose us to risks that could adversely affect our business operating results or financial condition and could prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under such indebtedness 

as of january 2 2021 we had total outstanding indebtedness of 3468 million we also have the ability to borrow an additional 3500 million under our revolving credit facility with the right to request increased capacity up to an additional 2500 million subject to the receipt of lender commitments subject to the limits contained in the credit agreement governing our revolving credit facility the indenture that governs the 4375 senior notes due october 15 2024 the “2024 notes” and our other debt instruments we may be able to incur substantial additional debt from time to time to finance working capital capital expenditures investments or acquisitions share repurchases or for other purposes if we do so the risks related to our level of debt could intensify specifically our level of debt could have important consequences including the following 

• making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations to service our debt as described above 

• limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital capital expenditures acquisitions or other general corporate requirements 

• requiring a substantial portion of our cash flows to be dedicated to debt service payments instead of other purposes thereby reducing the amount of cash flows available for working capital capital expenditures acquisitions and other general corporate purposes 

• utilizing large portions of our us cash to service our debt obligations because those payments are made in the united states which may require us to repatriate cash from outside the united states 

• increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions 

• exposing us to the risk of increased interest rates as certain of our borrowings including borrowings under our revolving credit facility are at variable rates of interest 

• limiting our flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in the industry in which we compete 

• placing us at a disadvantage compared to other less leveraged competitors and competitors that have greater access to capital resources 

• limiting our interest deductions for us income tax purposes and 

• increasing our cost of borrowing 

at the option of the holders of our outstanding notes we may under certain circumstances be required to repurchase such notes 

under the terms of our 2024 notes we may be required to repurchase for cash such notes prior to their maturity in connection with the occurrence of certain significant corporate events specifically we are required to offer to repurchase such notes upon a “change of control triggering event” as defined in the indenture related to such notes such as a change of control accompanied by certain downgrades in the credit ratings of such notes the repayment obligations under such notes may have the effect of discouraging delaying or preventing a takeover of our company if we were required to pay the 2024 notes prior to their scheduled maturity it could have a significant negative impact on our cash and liquidity and could impact our ability to invest financial resources in other strategic initiatives 

the terms of the agreement governing our revolving credit facility and the indenture governing our 2024 notes restrict our current and future operations particularly our ability to respond to changes or to take certain actions 

the agreement governing our revolving credit facility contains a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and may limit our ability to engage in acts that may be in our longterm best interest including restrictions on our ability to 

• pay dividends or make other distributions or repurchase or redeem capital stock or enter into agreements restricting our subsidiaries’ ability to pay dividends 

• prepay redeem or repurchase certain debt 

• issue certain preferred stock or similar equity securities 

• make certain investments 

• incur liens or additional indebtedness and guarantee indebtedness 

• enter into sale and leaseback transactions 

• enter into transactions with affiliates 

• alter the businesses we conduct and 

• consolidate merge or sell all or substantially all of our assets 

in addition the restrictive covenants in the agreement governing our revolving credit facility require us to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy other financial condition tests our ability to meet those financial ratios and tests can be affected by events beyond our control and we may be unable to meet them  

a breach of the covenants or restrictions under the agreement governing our revolving credit facility could result in an event of default under the applicable indebtedness such a default may allow the creditors to accelerate the related debt and may result in the acceleration of any other debt to which a crossacceleration or crossdefault provision applies in addition an event of default under the credit agreement governing our revolving credit facility would permit the lenders under our revolving credit facility to terminate all commitments to extend further credit under that facility in the event our lenders or note holders accelerate the repayment of our borrowings we and our subsidiaries may not have sufficient assets to repay that indebtedness as a result of these restrictions we may be 

• limited in how we conduct our business 

• unable to raise additional debt or equity financing to operate during general economic or business downturns or 

• unable to compete effectively or to take advantage of new business opportunities 

the indenture governing our 2024 notes also contains certain restrictive covenants that impose operating and financial restrictions on us and may limit our ability to engage in acts that may be in our longterm best interest including restrictions on our ability to incur liens and to enter into sale and leaseback transactions 

these restrictions may affect our ability to grow in accordance with our strategy in addition our financial results our substantial indebtedness and our credit ratings could adversely affect the availability and terms of our financing  

we may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness which may not be successful  

our ability to make scheduled payments on or refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial condition and operating performance which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial business legislative regulatory and other factors beyond our control we may be unable to maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal premium if any and interest on our indebtedness our inability to generate sufficient cash flows to satisfy our debt obligations or to refinance our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all would materially and adversely affect our financial position and results of operations and our ability to satisfy our debt obligations 

if our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations we could face substantial liquidity problems and could be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures or to dispose of material assets or operations seek additional debt or equity capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness we may not be able to effect any such alternative measures if necessary on commercially reasonable terms or at all and even if successful those alternative actions may not allow us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations the agreement governing our revolving credit facility restricts our ability to dispose of assets and use the proceeds from those dispositions and may also restrict our ability to raise debt or equity capital to be used to repay other indebtedness when it becomes due we may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain proceeds in an amount sufficient to meet any debt service obligations then due 

in addition we conduct a substantial portion of our operations through our subsidiaries none of which are currently guarantors of our indebtedness accordingly repayment of our indebtedness is dependent on the generation of cash flow by our subsidiaries and their ability to make such cash available to us by dividend debt repayment or otherwise unless they become guarantors of our indebtedness our subsidiaries do not have any obligation to pay amounts due on our indebtedness or to make funds available for that purpose our subsidiaries may not be able to or may not be permitted to make distributions to enable us to make payments in respect of our indebtedness each subsidiary is a distinct legal entity and under certain circumstances legal and contractual restrictions may limit our ability to obtain cash from our subsidiaries while the agreement governing our revolving credit facility limits the ability of our subsidiaries to incur consensual restrictions on their ability to pay dividends or make other intercompany payments to us these limitations are subject to qualifications and exceptions in the event that we do not receive distributions from our subsidiaries we may be unable to make required principal and interest payments on our indebtedness 

if we cannot make scheduled payments on our debt we will be in default and holders of our debt could declare all outstanding principal and interest to be due and payable the lenders under our revolving credit facility could terminate their commitments to loan money and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation in addition a material default on our indebtedness could suspend our eligibility to register securities using certain registration statement forms under sec guidelines that permit incorporation by reference of substantial information regarding us potentially hindering our ability to raise capital through the issuance of our securities and increasing our costs of registration 

despite our current level of indebtedness we and our subsidiaries may incur substantially more debt this could further exacerbate the risks to our financial condition described above 

we and our subsidiaries may incur significant additional indebtedness in the future although the agreement governing our revolving credit facility contains restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions and the additional indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial if we incur any additional indebtedness that ranks equally with the 2024 notes then subject to any collateral arrangements we may enter into the holders of that debt will be entitled to share ratably in any proceeds distributed in connection with any insolvency liquidation reorganization dissolution or other winding up of our company 

our variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly 

borrowings under our revolving credit facility are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk if interest rates were to increase our debt service obligations on our variable rate indebtedness would increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same and our net income and cash flows including cash available for servicing our indebtedness would correspondingly decrease assuming all loans were fully drawn and we were to fully exercise our right to increase borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility each quarter point change in interest rates would result in a 15 million change in annual interest expense on our indebtedness under our revolving credit facility in the future we may enter into interest rate swaps that involve the exchange of floating for fixed rate interest payments in order to reduce interest rate volatility however we may not maintain interest rate swaps with respect to all of our variable rate indebtedness and any swaps we enter into may not fully mitigate our interest rate risk 

our revolving credit facility utilizes libor or various alternative methods to calculate the amount of accrued interest on any borrowings regulators in certain jurisdictions including the united kingdom and the united states have announced the desire to phase out the use of libor by the end of 2021 though the ice benchmark administration the administrator of libor announced plans to consult to extend the timeline for ceasing publication for certain tenors of us dollar libor to june 30 2023 the transition from libor to a new replacement benchmark is uncertain at this time and the consequences of such developments cannot be entirely predicted but could result in an increase in the cost of our borrowings under our existing credit facility and any future borrowings 

various factors could increase our future borrowing costs or reduce our access to capital including a lowering or withdrawal of the ratings assigned to our 2024 notes by credit rating agencies 

we may in the future seek additional financing for a variety of reasons and our future borrowing costs and access to capital could be affected by factors including the condition of the debt and equity markets the condition of the economy generally prevailing interest rates our level of indebtedness and our business and financial condition in addition the 2024 notes currently have an investment grade credit rating and any credit rating assigned could be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a credit rating agency if in that credit rating agency’s judgment future circumstances relating to the basis of the credit rating such as adverse changes so warrant consequently real or anticipated changes in our credit ratings will generally affect the market value of the 2024 notes any future lowering of the credit ratings of the 2024 notes likely would make it more difficult or more expensive for us to obtain additional debt financing

during the first quarter of fiscal 2020 we completed our acquisitions of awr and integrand the aggregate cash consideration for these acquisitions of approximately 196 million was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their respective estimated fair values on the respective acquisition dates these acquisitions enhance our technology portfolio to address growing radio frequency design activity driven by expanding use of 5g communications these acquisitions increased expenses including amortization of acquired intangible assets more than revenue during fiscal 2020 

during the first quarter of fiscal 2021 we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire all of the outstanding equity of belgiumbased numeca a leader in cfd mesh generation multiphysics simulation and optimization the addition of numeca’s technologies and talent supports our intelligent system design™ strategy the acquisition is expected to close in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 subject to customary closing conditions 

management uses certain performance indicators to manage our business including revenue certain elements of operating expenses and cash flow from operations and we describe these items further below under the headings “results of operations” and “liquidity and capital resources” 

covid19 impact 

in march 2020 the world health organization declared the outbreak of covid19 a pandemic which continues to spread throughout the us and the world and has resulted in authorities implementing numerous measures to contain the virus including travel bans and restrictions quarantines shelterinplace orders and business limitations and shutdowns we are unable to accurately predict the full impact that covid19 will have on our results of operations financial condition liquidity and cash flows due to numerous uncertainties including the duration and severity of the pandemic and containment measures our compliance with these containment measures has impacted our daytoday operations and could disrupt our business and operations as well as that of our key customers suppliers including contract manufacturers and other counterparties for an indefinite period of time to support the health and wellbeing of our employees customers partners and communities a vast majority of our employees are still working remotely as of february 22 2021 

the covid19 pandemic has caused some volatility in our usual delivery timing for our hardware and ip products to certain customers many of our customers employees are working remotely and in some cases we have experienced delivery lead times that are longer than normal because of delays in getting access to customer sites to complete our deliveries in other cases the amount of our hardware and ip products that we have been able to deliver has been greater than we originally anticipated at the beginning of the respective period we have also received numerous covid19 pandemicrelated requests from our customers to allow them to delay their payments to us while we continue to provide services to these customers despite the challenges the covid19 pandemic has posed to our operations it did not have material adverse impact on our results of operations financial condition liquidity or cash flows during fiscal 2020 we will continue to evaluate the nature and extent of the impact of covid19 on our business see part i item 1a “risk factors” for additional information on the impact of covid19 

results of operations 

the discussion of our fiscal 2020 consolidated results of operations include yearoveryear comparisons to fiscal 2019 for revenue cost of revenue operating expenses operating margin other nonoperating expenses income taxes and cash flows for a discussion of the fiscal 2019 changes compared to fiscal 2018 see the discussion in item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in our annual report on form 10k for the fiscal year ended december 28 2019 filed on february 24 2020 

our fiscal years are 52 or 53week periods ending on the saturday closest to december 31 fiscal 2020 was a 53week year compared to 2019 and 2018 which were each 52week fiscal years the additional week in fiscal 2020 resulted in additional revenue of approximately 45 million and additional expense including stockbased compensation and amortization of acquired intangibles of approximately 35 million 

results of operations for fiscal 2020 as compared to fiscal 2019 reflect the following 

• increased product and maintenance revenue resulting from growth in software ip and hardware particularly in china and the united states 

• higher selling costs including additional investment in technical sales support in response to our customers’ increasing technological requirements 

• continued investment in research and development activities focused on expanding and enhancing our product portfolio 

• decreased operating expenses for travel meetings and events due to various measures implemented to contain covid19 

• a 3 percentage point increase in operating margin driven primarily by revenue growth and temporary decreases in certain operating expenses due to the covid19 pandemic and 

• changes in our provision benefit for income taxes due to a noncash tax benefit resulting from intercompany transfers of certain intangible property rights to our irish subsidiary during fiscal 2019 

revenue 

we primarily generate revenue from licensing our software and ip selling or leasing our emulation and prototyping hardware technology providing maintenance for our software hardware and ip providing engineering services and earning royalties generated from the use of our ip the timing of our revenue is significantly affected by the mix of software hardware and ip products generating revenue in any given period and whether the revenue is recognized over time or at a point in time upon completion of delivery 

in any fiscal year we expect that between 85 and 90 of our annual revenue will be characterized as recurring revenue revenue characterized as recurring includes revenue recognized over time from our software arrangements services royalties maintenance on ip licenses and hardware and operating leases of hardware and revenue recognized at varying points in time over the term of our ip access agreements 

the remainder of our revenue is characterized as upfront revenue upfront revenue is primarily generated by our sales of emulation and prototyping hardware and individual ip licenses the percentage of our recurring and upfront revenue may be impacted by delivery of hardware and ip products to our customers in any single fiscal period 

revenue by year 

the following table shows our revenue for fiscal 2020 and 2019 and the change in revenue between years 



product and maintenance revenue increased during fiscal 2020 as compared to fiscal 2019 primarily because of increased investments by our customers in new complex designs for their products that include the design of electronic systems for consumer hyperscale computing 5g communications automotive aerospace and defense industrial and healthcare services revenue may fluctuate from period to period based on the timing of fulfillment of our services and ip performance obligations 

no one customer accounted for 10 or more of total revenue during fiscal 2020 or 2019 

revenue by product category 

the following table shows the percentage of product and related maintenance revenue contributed by each of our five product categories and services during fiscal 2020 and 2019 



revenue by product category fluctuates from period to period based on demand for our products and services our available resources and our ability to deliver and support them certain of our licensing arrangements allow customers the ability to remix among software products additionally we have arrangements with customers that include a combination of our products with the actual product selection and number of licensed users to be determined at a later date for these arrangements we estimate the allocation of the revenue to product categories based upon the expected usage of our products the actual usage of our products by these customers may differ and if that proves to be the case the revenue allocation in the table above would differ 

revenue by geography 



revenue in the united states increased during fiscal 2020 as compared to fiscal 2019 primarily due to an increase in revenue for software and ip offerings 

revenue in china increased during fiscal 2020 as compared to fiscal 2019due to increased demand from many of our customers in china we experienced an increase in demand in the first half of fiscal 2020 that resulted in approximately 13 of our total revenue being generated from customers in china as compared to approximately 11 during the first half of fiscal 2019 this was followed by an additional increase in demand in the second half of fiscal 2020 that resulted in approximately 17 of our revenue being generated from customers in china as compared to approximately 10 during the second half of fiscal 2019 during fiscal 2021 we expect revenue from our customers in china to be consistent as a percentage of total revenue with the first half of fiscal 2020 

beginning in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 we have not been able to deliver maintenance or support for certain customers in china due to the us department of commerce’s designation of these customers to the “entity list” we expect these restrictions and new or expanded trade restrictions to continue to impact revenue from certain customers in china 

for the primary factors contributing to the change in revenue for other geographies during fiscal 2020 as compared to fiscal 2019 see the general description under “revenue by year” and “revenue by product category” above 

revenue by geography as a percent of total revenue 



most of our revenue is transacted in the united states dollar however certain revenue transactions are denominated in foreign currencies for an additional description of how changes in foreign exchange rates affect our consolidated financial statements see the discussion under item 7a “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk – foreign currency risk” 

cost of revenue 

  



the following table shows cost of revenue as a percentage of related revenue for fiscal 2020 and 2019 

  



cost of product and maintenance 

cost of product and maintenance includes costs associated with the sale and lease of our emulation and prototyping hardware and licensing of our software and ip products certain employee salary and benefits and other employeerelated costs cost of our customer support services amortization of technologyrelated and maintenancerelated acquired intangibles costs of technical documentation and royalties payable to thirdparty vendors cost of product and maintenance depends primarily on our hardware product sales in any given period but is also affected by employee salary and benefits and other employeerelated costs reserves for inventory and the timing and extent to which we acquire intangible assets license thirdparty technology or ip and sell our products that include such acquired or licensed technology or ip 

a summary of cost of product and maintenance for fiscal 2020 and 2019 is as follows 



product and maintenancerelated costs increased during fiscal 2020 when compared to fiscal 2019 due to the following 



costs associated with our emulation and prototyping hardware products include components assembly testing applicable reserves and overhead these costs make our cost of emulation and prototyping hardware products higher as a percentage of revenue than our cost of software and ip products the increase in emulation and prototyping hardware costs during fiscal 2020 as compared to fiscal 2019 was primarily due to increased demand for our emulation and prototyping hardware increased reserves for inventory and the mix of products generating revenue 

amortization of acquired intangibles included in cost of product and maintenance increased by 94 million during fiscal 2020 as compared to fiscal 2019 due to technologyrelated intangible assets acquired from awr and integrand during fiscal 2020 and inprocess technology being placed into service during fiscal 2020 and 2019 this increase was partially offset by certain technologyrelated intangible assets becoming fully amortized during fiscal 2020 and 2019 

cost of services 

cost of services primarily includes employee salary benefits and other employeerelated costs to perform work on revenuegenerating projects and costs to maintain the infrastructure necessary to manage a services organization cost of services may fluctuate from period to period based on our utilization of design services engineers on revenuegenerating projects rather than internal development projects despite an increase in services revenue cost of services decreased during fiscal 2020 as compared to fiscal 2019 due to a higher margin on the mix of services arrangements in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 and temporary savings due to the covid pandemic 

operating expenses 

our operating expenses include marketing and sales research and development and general and administrative expenses factors that tend to cause our operating expenses to fluctuate include changes in the number of employees due to hiring and acquisitions stockbased compensation restructuring activities foreign exchange rate movements and the impact of our variable compensation programs that are driven by operating results during fiscal 2020 we experienced decreased operating expenses for travel meetings and events due to various measures implemented to contain covid19 

many of our operating expenses are transacted in various foreign currencies we recognize lower expenses in periods when the united states dollar strengthens in value against other currencies and we recognize higher expenses when the united states dollar weakens against other currencies for an additional description of how changes in foreign exchange rates affect our consolidated financial statements see the discussion in item 7a “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk – foreign currency risk” 

our operating expenses for fiscal 2020 and 2019 were as follows 



our operating expenses as a percentage of total revenue for fiscal 2020 and 2019 were as follows 



  marketing and sales 

the changes in marketing and sales expense were due to the following 



salary benefits and other employeerelated costs included in marketing and sales increased during fiscal 2020 as compared to fiscal 2019 salary benefits and other employeerelated costs included in marketing and sales expense increased due primarily to additional headcount from hiring and acquisitions and variable compensation as we continue to invest in technical sales support in response to our customers’ increasing technological requirements this increase was partially offset by reduced costs for marketing events and travel due to covid19 

research and development 

the changes in research and development expense were due to the following 



salary benefits and other employeerelated costs included in research and development expense increased during fiscal 2020 as compared to fiscal 2019 due primarily to additional headcount from hiring and acquisitions and variable compensation as we continue to expand and enhance our product portfolio this increase was partially offset by reduced costs for travel due to covid19 

general and administrative 

the changes in general and administrative expense were due to the following 



salary benefits and other employeerelated costs included in general and administrative expense increased during fiscal 2020 as compared to fiscal 2019 due primarily to an increase in variable compensation and additional headcount from hiring 

amortization of acquired intangibles 

amortization of acquired intangibles consists primarily of amortization of customer relationships acquired backlog trade names trademarks and patents amortization in any given period depends primarily the timing and extent to which we acquire intangible assets 



amortization of acquired intangibles increased by 73 million during fiscal 2020 as compared to fiscal 2019 due to intangibles assets acquired from awr and integrand during fiscal 2020 this increase was partially offset by certain intangible assets becoming fully amortized during fiscal 2020 and 2019 

restructuring and other charges 

we have initiated restructuring plans in recent years to better align our resources with our business strategy because the restructuring charges and related benefits are derived from management’s estimates made during the formulation of the restructuring plans based on thencurrently available information our restructuring plans may not achieve the benefits anticipated on the timetable or at the level contemplated additional actions including further restructuring of our operations may be required in the future 

the following table presents restructuring and other charges net for our restructuring plans 



for an additional description of our restructuring plans see note 13 in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

operating margin 

operating margin represents income from operations as a percentage of total revenue our operating margin for fiscal 2020 and 2019 was as follows 



operating margin increased during fiscal 2020 as compared to fiscal 2019 because revenue growth exceeded the growth of our costs and expenses during fiscal 2021 we expect growth in operating margin will be more moderate due to an increase in costs and expenses associated with acquisitions including increased amortization of intangibles we also expect an increase in expenses related to travel meetings and events if measures implemented to contain covid19 are lifted 

interest expense 

interest expense for fiscal 2020 and 2019 was comprised of the following 



interest expense increased during fiscal 2020 as compared to fiscal 2019 due to borrowings of 350 million under our revolving credit facility during the first quarter of fiscal 2020 as a precautionary measure to provide additional liquidity in light of global economic uncertainty all outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility were repaid in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 for an additional description of our debt arrangements including our revolving credit facility see note 3 in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

income taxes 

the following table presents the provision benefit for income taxes and the effective tax rate for fiscal 2020 and 2019 



in june 2020 the state of california enacted legislation that for a threeyear period beginning in fiscal 2020 will limit our utilization of california research and development tax credits to 5 million annually and will suspend the use of california net operating loss deductions we accounted for the effects of the california tax law change and we recognized a tax benefit of approximately 222 million due to a partial release of the valuation allowance on our california research and development tax credit deferred tax assets as a result of certain tax elections made in our 2019 california tax return 

our provision for fiscal 2020 was primarily attributable to federal state and foreign income taxes on our fiscal 2020 income partially offset by the tax benefit of 222 million related to the partial release of the valuation allowance on our california research and development tax credit deferred tax assets and the tax benefit of 601 million related to stockbased compensation that vested or was exercised during fiscal 2020 

during fiscal 2019 we completed intercompany transfers of certain intangible property rights to our irish subsidiary which resulted in the establishment of a net deferred tax asset and the recognition of an income tax benefit of 5756 million we expected to realize the deferred tax asset in future periods and did not provide for a valuation allowance 

this income tax benefit was partially offset by the federal state and foreign income taxes on our fiscal 2019 income we also recognized 368 million of tax benefit related to stockbased compensation that vested or was exercised during the year 

our future effective tax rates may be materially impacted by tax amounts associated with our foreign earnings at rates different from the united states federal statutory rate research credits the tax impact of stockbased compensation accounting for uncertain tax positions business combinations closure of statutes of limitations or settlement of tax audits changes in valuation allowance and changes in tax law a significant amount of our foreign earnings is generated by our subsidiaries organized in ireland and hungary our future effective tax rates may be adversely affected if our earnings were to be lower in countries where we have lower statutory tax rates we currently expect that our fiscal 2021 effective tax rate will be approximately 14 we expect that our quarterly effective tax rates will vary from our fiscal 2021 effective tax rate as a result of recognizing the income tax effects of stockbased awards in the quarterly periods that the awards vest or are settled and other items that we cannot anticipate for additional discussion about how our effective tax rate could be affected by various risks see part i item 1a “risk factors” for further discussion regarding our income taxes see note 6 in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

liquidity and capital resources 



cash and cash equivalents 

as of january 2 2021 our principal sources of liquidity consisted of 9284 million of cash and cash equivalents as compared to 7052 million as of december 28 2019 

our primary sources of cash and cash equivalents during fiscal 2020 were cash generated from operations proceeds from borrowings under our revolving credit facility proceeds from the exercise of stock options and proceeds from stock purchases under our employee stock purchase plan 

our primary uses of cash and cash equivalents during fiscal 2020 were payments related to salaries and benefits operating expenses repurchases of our common stock payments on our revolving credit facility payments for business combinations net of cash acquired and purchases of property plant and equipment 

approximately 61 of our cash and cash equivalents were held by our foreign subsidiaries as of january 2 2021 our cash and cash equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries may vary from period to period due to the timing of collections and repatriation of foreign earnings we expect that current cash and cash equivalent balances cash flows that are generated from operations and cash borrowings available under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to meet our domestic and international working capital needs and other capital and liquidity requirements including acquisitions and share repurchases for at least the next 12 months 

net working capital 

net working capital is comprised of current assets less current liabilities as shown on our consolidated balance sheets the increase in our net working capital as of january 2 2021 as compared to december 28 2019 is primarily due to improved results from operations the timing of cash receipts from customers and disbursements made to vendors 

cash flows from operating activities 

cash flows from operating activities during fiscal 2020 and 2019 were as follows 



cash flows from operating activities include net income adjusted for certain noncash items as well as changes in the balances of certain assets and liabilities our cash flows from operating activities are significantly influenced by business levels and the payment terms set forth in our customer agreements the increase in cash flows from operating activities during fiscal 2020 as compared to fiscal 2019 was primarily due to the improved results from operations and timing of cash receipts from customers and disbursements made to vendors 

cash flows from investing activities 

cash flows used for investing activities during fiscal 2020 and 2019 were as follows 



the increase in cash used for investing activities during fiscal 2020 as compared to fiscal 2019 was primarily due to an increase in cash paid in business combinations net of cash acquired and an increase in purchases of property plant and equipment these increases were partially offset by a decrease in payments to acquire equity instruments of other entities we expect to continue our investing activities including purchasing property plant and equipment purchasing intangible assets business combinations purchasing software licenses and making strategic investments 

cash flows from financing activities 

cash flows used for financing activities during fiscal 2020 and 2019 were as follows 



the decrease in cash used for financing activities during fiscal 2020 as compared to fiscal 2019 was primarily due to a decrease in net cash paid for debt arrangements partially offset by an increase in payments for repurchases of our common stock 

other factors affecting liquidity and capital resources 

stock repurchase program 

at the end of fiscal 2019 approximately 369 million remained available under our previously announced authorization to repurchase shares of our common stock in july 2020 cadence’s board of directors increased the previously announced authorization to repurchase shares of cadence common stock by an additional 750 million the actual timing and amount of repurchases are subject to business and market conditions corporate and regulatory requirements stock price acquisition opportunities and other factors as of january 2 2021 approximately 739 million remained available to repurchase shares of cadence common stock see part ii item 5 “market for registrant’s common equity related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities” for additional information 

revolving credit facility 

our senior unsecured revolving credit facility provides for borrowings up to 3500 million with the right to request increased capacity up to an additional 2500 million upon the receipt of lender commitments for total maximum borrowings of 6000 million the credit facility expires on january 28 2022 and currently has no subsidiary guarantors any outstanding loans drawn under the credit facility are due at maturity on january 28 2022 outstanding borrowings may be paid at any time prior to maturity as of january 2 2021 there were no borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility and we were in compliance with all financial covenants associated with the revolving credit facility 

2024 notes 

in october 2014 we issued 3500 million aggregate principal amount of 4375 senior notes due october 15 2024 we received net proceeds of 3424 million from the issuance of the 2024 notes net of a discount of 14 million and issuance costs of 62 million interest is payable in cash semiannually the 2024 notes are unsecured and rank equal in right of payment to all of our existing and future senior indebtedness as of january 2 2021 we were in compliance with all covenants associated with the 2024 notes 

for additional information relating to our debt arrangements see note 3 in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

contractual obligations 

a summary of our contractual obligations as of january 2 2021 is as follows 



 

1 this table includes future payments under leases that had commenced as of january 2 2021 as well as leases that had been signed but not yet commenced as of january 2 2021 

2 included in other longterm contractual obligations are longterm income tax liabilities of 176 million related to unrecognized tax benefits of the 176 million we estimate 163 million will be paid or settled within 1 to 3 years 12 million within 3 to 5 years and 01 million in more than 5 years the remaining portion of other longterm contractual obligations is primarily liabilities associated with defined benefit retirement plans and acquisitions 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

as of january 2 2021 we did not have any significant offbalance sheet arrangements as defined in item 303a4ii of sec regulation sk 

critical accounting estimates 

in preparing our consolidated financial statements we make assumptions judgments and estimates that can have a significant impact on our revenue operating income and net income as well as on the value of certain assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets we base our assumptions judgments and estimates on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions at least quarterly we evaluate our assumptions judgments and estimates and make changes as deemed necessary 

we believe that the assumptions judgments and estimates involved in the accounting for income taxes revenue recognition and business combinations have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements therefore we consider these to be our critical accounting estimates for information on our significant accounting policies see note 2 in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition 

our contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple software andor ip licenses hardware and services including professional services technical support services and rights to unspecified updates to a customer these contracts require us to apply judgement in identifying and evaluating any terms and conditions in contracts which may impact revenue recognition determining whether licenses and services are distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately or not distinct and thus accounted for together requires significant judgment in some arrangements such as most of our ip license arrangements we have concluded that the licenses and associated services are distinct from each other in other arrangements like our timebased software arrangements the licenses and certain services are not distinct from each other our timebased software arrangements include multiple software licenses and updates to the licensed software products as well as technical support and we have concluded that these promised goods and services are a single combined performance obligation 

judgment is required to determine the standalone selling prices “ssps” for each distinct performance obligation we rarely license or sell products on a standalone basis so we are required to estimate the ssp for each performance obligation in instances where the ssp is not directly observable because we do not sell the license product or service separately we determine the ssp using information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs we typically have more than one ssp for individual performance obligations due to the stratification of those items by classes of customers and circumstances in these instances we may use information such as the size of the customer and geographic region of the customer in determining the ssp 

revenue is recognized over time for our combined performance obligations that include software licenses updates and technical support as well as for maintenance and professional services that are separate performance obligations for our professional services revenue is recognized over time generally using costs incurred or hours expended to measure progress judgment is required in estimating project status and the costs necessary to complete projects a number of internal and external factors can affect these estimates including labor rates utilization and efficiency variances and specification and testing requirement changes for our other performance obligations recognized over time revenue is generally recognized using a timebased measure of progress reflecting generally consistent efforts to satisfy those performance obligations throughout the arrangement term 

if a group of agreements are so closely related that they are in effect part of a single arrangement such agreements are deemed to be one arrangement for revenue recognition purposes we exercise significant judgment to evaluate the relevant facts and circumstances in determining whether the separate agreements should be accounted for separately or as in substance a single arrangement our judgments about whether a group of contracts comprise a single arrangement can affect the allocation of consideration to the distinct performance obligations which could have an effect on results of operations for the periods involved 

we are required to estimate the total consideration expected to be received from contracts with customers in some circumstances the consideration expected to be received is variable based on the specific terms of the contract or based on our expectations of the term of the contract generally we have not experienced significant returns or refunds to customers these estimates require significant judgment and the change in these estimates could have an effect on our results of operations during the periods involved 

accounting for income taxes 

we are subject to income taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our provision for these taxes there are many transactions that occur during the ordinary course of business for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain our provision for income taxes could be adversely affected by our earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries where we have higher statutory rates losses incurred in jurisdictions for which we are not able to realize the related tax benefit changes in foreign currency exchange rates entry into new businesses and geographies and changes to our existing businesses acquisitions and investments changes in our deferred tax assets and liabilities including changes in our assessment of valuation allowances changes in the relevant tax laws or interpretations of these tax laws and developments in current and future tax examinations 

we only recognize the tax benefit of an income tax position if we judge that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained solely on its technical merits in a tax audit including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes to make this judgment we must interpret complex and sometimes ambiguous tax laws regulations and administrative practices if we judge that an income tax position meets this recognition threshold then we must measure the amount of the tax benefit to be recognized by estimating the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50 cumulative probability of being realized upon settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all of the relevant facts it is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts as this requires us to determine the probability of various possible settlement outcomes we must reevaluate our income tax positions on a quarterly basis to consider factors such as changes in facts or circumstances changes in tax law effectively settled issues under audit the lapse of applicable statute of limitations and new audit activity such a change in recognition or measurement would result in recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision for a more detailed description of our unrecognized tax benefits see note 6 in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

during fiscal 2019 we completed intercompany transfers of certain intangible property rights to our irish subsidiary which resulted in the establishment of a deferred tax asset and the recognition of an income tax benefit of 5756 million to determine the value of the deferred tax asset we were required to make significant estimates in determining the fair value of the transferred ip rights these estimates included but are not limited to the income and cash flows that the ip rights are expected to generate in the future the appropriate discount rate to apply to the income and cash flow projections and the useful lives of the ip rights these estimates are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and if different estimates were used it would impact the fair value of the ip rights and the related value of the deferred tax asset and the income tax benefit recognized in fiscal 2019 and in future periods when the deferred tax asset is realized in addition we reviewed the need to establish a valuation allowance on the deferred tax asset of 5756 million by evaluating whether there is a greater than 50 likelihood that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized to make this judgment we must make significant estimates and predictions of the amount and category of future taxable income from various sources and weigh all available positive and negative evidence about these possible sources of taxable income we give greater weight to evidence that can be objectively verified based on our evaluation and weighting of the positive and negative evidence we concluded that it is greater than 50 likely that the deferred tax asset of 5756 million will be realized in future periods and that a valuation allowance was not currently required if in the future we evaluate that this deferred tax asset is not likely to be realized an increase in the related valuation allowance could result in a material income tax expense in the period such a determination is made 

business combinations 

when we acquire businesses we allocate the purchase price to the acquired tangible assets and assumed liabilities including deferred revenue liabilities associated with the fair value of contingent consideration and acquired identifiable intangible assets any residual purchase price is recorded as goodwill the allocation of the purchase price requires us to make significant estimates in determining the fair values of these acquired assets and assumed liabilities especially with respect to intangible assets and goodwill these estimates are based on information obtained from management of the acquired companies our assessment of this information and historical experience these estimates can include but are not limited to the cash flows that an acquired business is expected to generate in the future the cash flows that specific assets acquired with that business are expected to generate in the future the appropriate weightedaverage cost of capital and the cost savings expected to be derived from acquiring an asset these estimates are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and if different estimates were used the purchase price for the acquisition could be allocated to the acquired assets and assumed liabilities differently from the allocation that we have made to the acquired assets and assumed liabilities in addition unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that may affect the accuracy or validity of such estimates and if such events occur we may be required to adjust the value allocated to acquired assets or assumed liabilities 

we also make significant judgments and estimates when we assign useful lives to the definitelived intangible assets identified as part of our acquisitions these estimates are inherently uncertain and if we used different estimates the useful life over which we amortize intangible assets would be different in addition unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that may impact the useful life assigned to our intangible assets which would impact our amortization of intangible assets expense and our results of operations 

during the first quarter of fiscal 2020 we acquired intangible assets of 1013 million with our acquisition of awr and integrand the fair value of the definitelived intangible assets acquired with these acquisitions was determined using variations of the income approach 

for existing technology the fair value was determined by applying the relieffromroyalty method this method is based on the application of a royalty rate to forecasted revenue to quantify the benefit of owning the intangible asset rather than paying a royalty for use of the asset to estimate royalty savings over time we projected revenue from existing technology over the estimated remaining life of the technology including the effect of technological obsolescence which was estimated at rate between 5 and 75 annually before applying an assumed royalty rate of 20 the present value of aftertax royalty savings were determined using discount rates ranging from 10 to 115 

the fair value for customer contracts and related relationships was determined by using the multiperiod excess earnings method this method reflects the present value of the projected cash flows that are expected to be generated from existing customers less charges representing the contribution of other assets to those cash flows projected income from existing customer relationships considered customer retention rates ranging between 85 and 95 the present value of operating cash flows from existing customer was determined using discount rates 10 and 115 

we also assumed obligations related to deferred revenue of 69 million during the first quarter of fiscal 2020 with our acquisition of awr the fair value of these obligations was estimated using the cost buildup approach the cost buildup approach determines fair value using estimates of the costs required to fulfill the contracted obligations plus an assumed profit margin which approximates the amount that awr would be required to pay a third party to assume the obligation 

cadence believes that its estimates and assumptions related to the fair value of its acquired intangible assets and deferred revenue obligations are reasonable but significant judgment is involved

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

foreign currency risk 

a material portion of our revenue expenses and business activities are transacted in the us dollar in certain foreign countries where we price our products and services in us dollars a decrease in value of the local currency relative to the us dollar results in an increase in the prices for our products and services compared to those products of our competitors that are priced in local currency this could result in our prices being uncompetitive in certain markets 

in certain countries where we may invoice customers in the local currency our revenues benefit from a weaker dollar and are adversely affected by a stronger dollar the opposite impact occurs in countries where we record expenses in local currencies in those cases our costs and expenses benefit from a stronger dollar and are adversely affected by a weaker dollar the fluctuations in our operating expenses outside the united states resulting from volatility in foreign exchange rates are not generally moderated by corresponding fluctuations in revenues from existing contracts 

we enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to protect against currency exchange risks associated with existing assets and liabilities a foreign currency forward exchange contract acts as a hedge by increasing in value when underlying assets decrease in value or underlying liabilities increase in value due to changes in foreign exchange rates conversely a foreign currency forward exchange contract decreases in value when underlying assets increase in value or underlying liabilities decrease in value due to changes in foreign exchange rates these forward contracts are not designated as accounting hedges so the unrealized gains and losses are recognized in other income net in advance of the actual foreign currency cash flows with the fair value of these forward contracts being recorded as accrued liabilities or other current assets 

we do not use forward contracts for trading purposes our forward contracts generally have maturities of 90 days or less we enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts based on estimated future asset and liability exposures and the effectiveness of our hedging program depends on our ability to estimate these future asset and liability exposures recognized gains and losses with respect to our current hedging activities will ultimately depend on how accurately we are able to match the amount of foreign currency forward exchange contracts with actual underlying asset and liability exposures 

the following table provides information about our foreign currency forward exchange contracts as of january 2 2021 the information is provided in united states dollar equivalent amounts the table presents the notional amounts at contract exchange rates and the weighted average contractual foreign currency exchange rates expressed as units of the foreign currency per united states dollar which in some cases may not be the market convention for quoting a particular currency all of these forward contracts matured during february 2021 



we actively monitor our foreign currency risks but our foreign currency hedging activities may not substantially offset the impact of fluctuations in currency exchange rates on our results of operations cash flows and financial position 

interest rate risk 

our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our portfolio of cash and cash equivalents and balances outstanding on our revolving credit facility if any we are exposed to interest rate fluctuations in many of the world’s leading industrialized countries but our interest income and expense is most sensitive to fluctuations in the general level of united states interest rates in this regard changes in united states interest rates affect the interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents and the costs associated with foreign currency hedges 

all highly liquid securities with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase are considered to be cash equivalents the carrying value of our interestbearing instruments approximated fair value as of january 2 2021 

interest rates under our revolving credit facility are variable so interest expense could be adversely affected by changes in interest rates particularly for periods when we maintain a balance outstanding under the revolving credit facility interest rates for our revolving credit facility can fluctuate based on changes in market interest rates and in an interest rate margin that varies based on our consolidated leverage ratio as of january 2 2021 there were no borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility for an additional description of the revolving credit facility see note 3 in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

equity price risk 

equity investments 

we have a portfolio of equity investments that includes marketable equity securities and nonmarketable investments our equity investments are made primarily in connection with our strategic investment program under our strategic investment program from time to time we make cash investments in companies with technologies that are potentially strategically important to us see note 8 in the notes to consolidated financial statements for an additional description of these investments

 item 9a controls and procedures 

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

as required by rule 13a15 of the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended the “exchange act” under the supervision and with the participation of our management including our chief executive officer “ceo” and our chief financial officer “cfo” we evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rules 13a15e and 15d15e under the exchange act as of january 2 2021 

the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures included a review of our processes and the effect on the information generated for use in this annual report on form 10k in the course of this evaluation we sought to identify any material weaknesses in our disclosure controls and procedures to determine whether we had identified any acts of fraud involving personnel who have a significant role in our disclosure controls and procedures and to confirm that any necessary corrective action including process improvements was taken this type of evaluation is done every fiscal quarter so that our conclusions concerning the effectiveness of these controls can be reported in our periodic reports filed with the sec the overall goals of these evaluation activities are to monitor our disclosure controls and procedures and to make modifications as necessary we intend to maintain these disclosure controls and procedures modifying them as circumstances warrant 

based on their evaluation as of january 2 2021 our ceo and cfo have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by us in our reports filed or submitted under the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the sec’s rules and forms and is accumulated and communicated to our management including the ceo and cfo as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure 

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the fiscal quarter ended january 2 2021 that materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting 

inherent limitations on effectiveness of controls 

our management including our ceo and cfo does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud internal control over financial reporting no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of internal control are met further the design of internal control must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of the control must be considered relative to their costs while our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance of their effectiveness because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within cadence have been detected 

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rule 13a15f under the exchange act our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of january 2 2021 in making this assessment our management used the criteria established in internal controlintegrated framework 2013 issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission “coso” our management has concluded that as of january 2 2021 our internal control over financial reporting is effective based on these criteria our independent registered public accounting firm pricewaterhousecoopers llp has issued an attestation report on our internal control over financial reporting which is included in part iv item 15 “exhibits and financial statement schedules”

overview 

we enable our customers to design electronic products our products and services are designed to give our customers a competitive edge in their development of electronic systems integrated circuits “ics” electronic devices and increasingly sophisticated manufactured products our products and services do this by optimizing performance minimizing power consumption shortening the time to bring our customers’ products to market and reducing their design development and manufacturing costs our customers create and sell electronic products at differing levels of completeness our electronic systems customers deliver entire devices such as smartphones laptop computers gaming systems automobiles and autonomous driving systems servers cloud datacenter infrastructure artificial intelligence “ai” systems aerospace and defense medical equipment and networking products these systems companies internally develop or externally purchase the subcomponents for their products including printed circuit boards “pcbs” which interconnect all the hardware components ics which are often referred to as computer chips and software at various levels which runs on the hardware our semiconductor customers deliver ics which include subcategories such as memory chips systemsonchip “socs” analog chips processors and other types of chips 

we offer software hardware services and reusable ic design blocks which are commonly referred to as intellectual property “ip” systems customers use our offerings to develop and integrate software that is key to the functionality of their products as well as to design their ics and pcbs our semiconductor customers use our offerings to design configure analyze and verify ics additionally some customers license our ip which accelerates their product development processes by providing predesigned and verified circuit blocks for their ics 

our strategy which we call intelligent system design ™  provides the technologies necessary for our customers to develop and optimize a complete and functional electronic product we address the challenges posed by the needs and trends of electronic systems companies as well as semiconductor companies delivering greater portions of these systems the development of electronic products or their subcomponents is complex and requires many engineers using our solutions with specialized knowledge and skill the rate of technical innovation in electronics is swift long driven by a concept known as moore’s law which more than 50 years ago predicted that the complexity of ics would double about every 24 months in order to make our customers successful our products must handle this exponential growth rate in complexity without requiring a corresponding increase in our customers’ costs historically the industry that provided the tools used by ic engineers was referred to as electronic design automation “eda” today our offerings include and extend beyond eda tools to enable intelligent system design across three layers as illustrated below—starting with ic and soc design excellence followed by system innovation and then pervasive intelligence 

the core ic and soc design excellence requires core eda technologies for custom ic digital ic and signoff and functional verification and leverages prebuild semiconductor ip these tools ip and associated services are specifically designed to meet the requirements of engineers who design across analog digital and mixedsignal domains and perform the associated verification efforts including validation of lowlevel software running on the silicon model thereby enabling design teams to manage complexity without increasing the team size or extending the project schedule while reducing technical risks 

the second layer of our strategy centers around system innovation it includes tools and services used for system design of the packages that encapsulate the ics and the pcbs system simulation which includes electromagnetic electrothermal and other multiphysics analysis necessary as part of optimizing the full system’s performance radio frequency “rf” and microwave systems and embedded software 

the third layer of our strategy is enabling pervasive intelligence in new electronics it starts with providing solutions and services to develop aienhanced systems and includes machine learning and deep learning capabilities being added to the cadence technology portfolio to make ip and tools more automated and to produce optimized results faster supported by cloud access to address the growing computation needs of our customers 

business drivers 

our products and services allow our customers to design complex and innovative electronic products which are accelerated by growing digital transformation demand for our technology and expertise is driven by our customers’ investment in new designs and products the most promising new opportunities for us involve enabling the design of electronic systems for ai edge computing hyperscale computing including datacenter infrastructure communications including 5g networks augmented reality virtual reality internetofthings “iot” aerospace and defense automotive industrial and healthcare subsystems large and existing electronics categories such as datacenter servers smartphones and networking products continue to provide business opportunities for us as customers initiate new design projects 

underlying the requirements within any particular vertical market sector is the availability of rapidly improving ic manufacturing technology in order for our customers to take advantage of such advancements some of our products must first be developed to exploit new manufacturing capabilities this dependency means that we must invest significantly in product research and development “rd” to keep pace with the latest manufacturing technology the demand for new ic manufacturing technology directly impacts the demand for our newest products 

another driver for our business is the differentiation capabilities and benefits provided to our customers by our products with the rapid pace of innovation comes the opportunity for our products to address key challenges associated with electronic product creation such as power consumption performance and cost our products and services have unique attributes that our customers value in general these attributes can be grouped into broader categories such as quality of results “qor” in terms of power consumption performance and chip area engineering productivity tool performance and faster timetomarket our business opportunities are significantly enhanced when our offerings address these key factors we are applying machine learning techniques within our products to enhance qor productivity performance and methodology 

products and product strategy 

our intelligent system design strategy is to provide our customers with the ability to address the broad range of issues that arise as they develop electronic products our solutions are comprised of products that are categorized according to the role they play in the electronic product design process we combine our products and technologies into categories related to major design activities including custom ic and simulation digital ic design and signoff functional verification ip and system interconnect and analysis 

custom ic design and simulation 

our custom ic design and simulation offerings are used by our customers to create schematic and physical representations of circuits down to the transistor level for analog mixedsignal custom digital memory and rf designs these representations are verified using simulation tools optimized for each type of design including the design capture environment simulation and ic layout within the virtuoso ® custom design platform other tools in the custom ic portfolio are used to prepare the designs for manufacturing 

virtuoso advanced node adds functionality to the base virtuoso package to enable the use of threedimensional transistors “finfets” multipatterning and other technologies required for advanced designs the virtuoso rf solution addresses the challenges of rf design across chip package and board spectre ® simulator provides largescale verification simulation the virtuoso system design platform enables engineers to design and verify concurrently across the chip package and board 

digital ic design and signoff 

digital ic design and signoff offerings are used to create logical representations of a digital circuit or an ic that can be verified for correctness prior to implementation please refer to the discussion under “functional verification” below once the logic is verified the design representation is implemented or converted to a format ready for silicon manufacturing using additional software tools within this category the manufacturing representation is also analyzed and verified our digital ic and signoff technology suite provides a full flow to achieve power performance and area “ppa” design targets and includes three major categories logic design physical implementation and signoff 

our logic design offering is comprised of logic synthesis test and equivalence checking capabilities and is typically used by customers to create and verify designs in conjunction with our functional verification capabilities the offering includes the genus™ synthesis solution a logic synthesis offering that provides fast throughput while also offering high quality results the stratus™ highlevel synthesis solution for systemlevel synthesis and the joules™ rtl power solution which delivers fast power analysis while preserving nearsignoff accuracy we also offer the modus designfortest “dft” software solution which reduces soc test time 

our physical implementation offering comprises tools used near the end of the design process including place and route optimization and multipatterning preparation the innovus™ implementation system is a physical implementation offering that delivers fast design turnaround time while also delivering improved ppa characteristics this offering enables customers to address the technology challenges of the latest semiconductor advancedprocess nodes create a physical representation of logic models and prepare a design for signoff 

our signoff offering is comprised of tools used to signoff the design as ready for manufacture by a semiconductor foundry which provides certification for this step this offering includes the tempus™ timing signoff solution voltus™ power integrity solution quantus™ extraction solution and pegasus™ physical verification system our designformanufacturing “dfm” products are also included in our signoff offering and are used by customers to address manufacturing and yield issues as early in the product development process as possible 

functional verification 

functional verification products are used by our customers to efficiently and effectively verify that the circuitry or the software they have designed will perform as intended verification takes place during and after custom and analog design and before manufacturing the circuitry significantly reducing the risk of discovering a costly error in the completed product 

our verification suite™ includes four primary verification engines starting with the jaspergold ® formal verification platform and xcelium™ parallel logic simulation platform which are used in the early stages of design often at the ip and subsystem level once the design is more mature with early formal and simulation verification tasks performed verification engineers deploy our palladium ® emulation platform and protium™ prototyping platform for more complete chip verification often running lowlevel embedded software on top of a model of the chip to ensure proper functionality before silicon manufacturing 

these engines are used for early bug detection verification of blocklevel functionality verification acceleration and emulation of systemlevel functionality systemlevel power exploration analysis and optimization and systemlevel prototyping for hardwaresoftware coverification palladium provides high throughput capacity datacenter reliability and workgroup productivity to enable global design teams to develop advanced hardwaresoftware systems protium leverages a common front end with the palladium environment in order to move designs rapidly from emulation to the prototyping stage allowing for software development to start weeks to months earlier 

these engines are also supported by other verification tools that provide an environment that allows for effective verification throughput including verification planning and metric tracking testbench automation debugging and softwaredriven tests enabling our customers to coordinate verification activities across multiple verification engines and teams and locations for effective verification closure 

ip 

our ip offerings consist of preverified customizable functional blocks which customers integrate into their ics to accelerate the development process and to reduce the risk of errors in the design process we offer many types of ip including tensilica ® configurable digital signal processors “dsps” vertically targeted subsystems for ai audiovoice baseband and visionimaging applications controllers and physical interfaces for standard protocols and analog ip we have significantly expanded our design ip portfolio in recent years through acquisitions and internal development providing solutions for high speed serdes pci usb and many other standards 

we also offer a broad range of verification ip “vip” with memory models which model the expected behavior of many industry standard protocols when used with verification solutions and are complementary to our design ip offerings vip and accelerated vip “avip” which is used in emulation are used across the suite of functional verification engines to verify the correct interaction with dozens of design ip interface protocols such as ddr usb and pci express ®  our vip offerings are also used in systemlevel verification to model correct behavior of full systems interacting with their environments 

system interconnect and analysis 

our system interconnect and analysis offerings are used by our customers to develop pcbs and ic packages and analyze electromagnetic electrothermal and other multiphysics effects 

the capabilities in the allegro ® system interconnect design platform include pcb authoring and implementation ic package and systeminpackage “sip” design and signal and power integrity “sipi” analysis and pcb library design management and collaboration the need for compact highperformance mobile consumer and automotive design with advanced serial interconnect is driving the technology evolution for our pcb offerings for mainstream pcb customers where individual or small team productivity is a focus we provide the orcad ® family of offerings that is primarily marketed worldwide through a network of resellers 

our technology portfolio expanded in 2019 into the growing system analysis market segment the speed and close proximity of signals on silicon through packages to boards and through connectors and cables exposes these communications to various kinds of interference generates heat and emits electromagnetic radiation careful analysis is required to assure these systems will work as designed under a wide range of operating conditions and within compliance of standards and laws the complexity of these devices and signal transmissions requires analysis and simulation throughout the product lifecycle to meet these objectives our clarity™ 3d solver for electromagnetic and power electronics analysis and simulation as well as our celsius™ thermal solver provide the foundation for multiphysics analysis technology with complete electricalthermal cosimulation for electronic systems from ics to physical enclosures

product and maintenance and services revenue 

revenue and revenue as a percentage of total revenue from our product and maintenance and services offerings for the last three fiscal years were as follows 



between 85 and 90 of our revenue is characterized as recurring revenue revenue characterized as recurring includes revenue recognized over time from our software arrangements services royalties from certain ip arrangements maintenance on ip licenses and hardware operating leases of hardware and revenue recognized at varying points in time over the term of our ip access agreements 

the remainder of our revenue is characterized as upfront revenue upfront revenue is primarily generated by our sales of emulation and prototyping hardware and individual ip licenses the percentage of our recurring and upfront revenue may be impacted by delivery of hardware and ip products to our customers in any single fiscal period 

for an additional description of our product and maintenance and services revenue see the discussion under “results of operations” under part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” for our fiscal 2019 results of operations and our financial position as of december 28 2019  see part iv item 15 “exhibits and financial statement schedules” 

backlog and remaining performance obligations 

revenue allocated to remaining performance obligations represents the transaction price allocated to the performance obligations that are unsatisfied or partially unsatisfied which includes unearned revenue and amounts that will be invoiced and recognized as revenue in future periods we have elected to exclude the potential future royalty receipts from the remaining performance obligations contracted but unsatisfied performance obligations were approximately 36 billion as of december 28 2019  which includes 2057 million of noncancellable ipaa commitments from customers where actual product selection and quantities of specific products or services are to be determined by customers at a later date we expect to recognize approximately 55 of the revenue included in the contracted but unsatisfied performance obligations excluding noncancellable ipaa commitments over the next 12 months and the remainder thereafter 

marketing and sales 

we generally market our products and provide services to existing and prospective customers through a direct sales force consisting of sales people and applications engineers applications engineers provide technical presales and postsales support for our products due to the complexity of many of our products and the system design process the sales cycle is generally long requiring three to six months or more during the sales cycle our direct sales force generally provides technical presentations product demonstrations and support for onsite customer evaluation of our solutions we also promote our products and services through advertising marketing automation trade shows public relations and the internet we selectively utilize valueadded resellers to broaden our reach and reduce cost of sales our orcad products and certain allegro products are primarily marketed through these channels with respect to international sales we generally market and support our products and services through our subsidiaries we also use a thirdparty distributor to license our products and services to certain customers in japan 

research and development 

our future performance depends on our ability to innovate commercialize newly developed solutions and enhance and maintain our current products the primary areas of our research and development align with our product categories discussed above we must continuously reengineer our products to solve new or increased physics challenges that arise with each successive process node and address the increase in complexity that is introduced by the resulting much larger designs we must also keep pace with our customers’ technical developments satisfy industry standards and meet our customers’ increasingly demanding performance productivity quality and predictability requirements therefore we expect to continue to invest in research and development 

hardware manufacturing and software distribution 

our emulation and prototyping hardware including all individual pcbs custom ics and fpgabased prototyping components is manufactured assembled and tested by subcontractors before delivery to our customers software and documentation are primarily distributed to customers by secure electronic delivery by way of the cloud or on dvd 

proprietary technology 

our success depends in part upon our proprietary technology we generally rely on patents copyrights trademarks and trade secret laws licenses and restrictive agreements to establish and protect our proprietary rights in technology and products many of our products include software or other ip licensed from third parties we may have to seek new licenses or renew existing licenses for thirdparty software and other ip in the future as part of performing engineering services for customers our engineering services business uses certain software and other ip licensed from third parties including that of our competitors 

competition 

we compete most frequently with synopsys inc mentor graphics corporation a division of siemens ag and ansys inc and also with numerous other tools providers manufacturers of electronic devices that have developed acquired or have the capability to develop their own eda products technical software companies electronics design and consulting companies and other ip companies these include altium limited ceva inc keysight technologies inc and zuken ltd 

certain competitive factors in the engineering services business differ from those of the products businesses while we compete with other eda companies in the engineering services business our principal competitors include independent engineering service businesses many of these companies are also customers and therefore use our product offerings in the delivery of their services or products

 item 1a risk factors 

our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties including those described in the sections below that could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations cash flows and the trading price of our common stock 

risks related to our business 

any periods of uncertainty in the global economy and international trade relations and any potential downturn in the semiconductor and electronics industries may negatively impact our business and reduce our bookings levels and revenue 

purchases of our products and services are dependent upon the commencement of new design projects by ic manufacturers and electronics systems companies the ic and electronics systems industries are cyclical and are characterized by constant and rapid technological change rapid product obsolescence and price erosion evolving standards short product life cycles and wide fluctuations in product supply and demand 

the ic and electronics systems industries have also experienced significant downturns in connection with or in anticipation of maturing product cycles of both these industries’ and their customers’ products spending on our products and services has grown in recent years but the current outlook for the semiconductor industry is uncertain and may result in a decrease in spending on our products and services 

uncertainty about future political and economic conditions adverse changes to international trade relationships between countries in which we do business or future decline in corporate or consumer spending could negatively impact our customers’ businesses reducing the number of new chip designs and their overall research and development spending including their spending on our products and services and as a result decrease demand for our products and services decreased bookings for our products and services customer bankruptcies consolidation among our customers or problems or delays with our hardware suppliers or with the supply or delivery of our hardware products could also adversely affect our ability to grow our business or adversely affect our future revenues and financial results our future business and financial results including demand for our products and services are subject to considerable uncertainty that could impact our stock price if economic conditions or international trade relationships between countries in which we do business deteriorate in the future or in particular if semiconductor or electronics systems industry revenues do not grow the ability to export or import products or services by the semiconductor or electronics systems industry is adversely restricted or our supplies of hardware components and products are subject to problems or delays our future revenues and financial results could be adversely affected 

during fiscal 2019 the bureau of industry and security “bis” of the us department of commerce placed certain entities who are our customers on the “entity list” limiting our ability to deliver products and services to these entities when certain customers are on the entity list and in the absence of a license from the bis it will have a negative effect on our ability to sell products and provide services to these customers entity list restrictions will also encourage customers to seek substitute products from our competitors that are not subject to these restrictions or to develop their own solutions thereby decreasing our longterm competitiveness in addition although customers are not prohibited from paying and we are not restricted from collecting for products we previously delivered to them the credit risks associated with outstanding receivables from customers on the entity list could increase as a result of these limitations 

we cannot predict whether or when any changes will be made that eliminate or decrease these limitations on our ability to sell products and provide services to these customers we are unable to predict the duration of the export restrictions imposed with respect to any particular customer or the longterm effects on our business or our customers’ business additionally other companies may be added to the entity list andor be subject to trade restrictions in addition there may be indirect impacts to our business which we cannot reasonably quantify including that our business may also be impacted by other trade restrictions that may be imposed by the us china or other countries restrictions on our ability to sell and ship our products to customers on the entity list have had and may continue to have an adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

customer consolidation could affect our operating results 

there has been a trend toward customer consolidation in the semiconductor industry through business combinations including mergers asset acquisitions and strategic partnerships as this trend continues it could make us more dependent on fewer customers who may be able to exert increased pressure on our prices and other contract terms and could increase the portion of our total sales concentration for any single customer customer consolidation activity could also reduce the demand for our products and services if such customers streamline research and development or operations reduce purchases or delay purchasing decisions these outcomes could negatively impact our operating results and financial condition 

our failure to respond quickly to technological developments or customers’ increasing technological requirements could make our products uncompetitive and obsolete 

the industries in which we compete experience rapid technology developments rapid changes in industry standards and customer requirements and frequent introductions and improvements of new products currently the industries we serve are experiencing the following trends 

 if we are unable to respond quickly and successfully to these trends we may lose our competitive position and our products or technologies may become obsolete to compete successfully we must develop acquire or license new products and improve our existing products and processes on a schedule that keeps pace with technological developments and the requirements for products addressing a broad spectrum of designers and designer expertise in our industries we must provide frequent and relevant updates to our software products in order to provide substantial benefit to the customer throughout the license periods because of the rapid changes in our customers’ industries the market must also accept our new and improved products our hardware platforms must be enhanced periodically to reduce the likelihood that a competitor surpasses the capabilities we offer our introduction of new products could reduce the demand and revenue of our older products or affect their pricing we must also be able to support a range of changing computer software hardware platforms and customer preferences a transition by our customers to different business models associated with cloud computing technologies could result in reduced revenue we cannot guarantee that we will be successful in keeping pace with all or any of the customer trends 

competitive pressures may require us to reduce our pricing which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

the highly competitive markets in which we do business can put pressure on us to reduce the prices of our software emulation and prototyping hardware and ip if our competitors offer significant discounts on certain products in an effort to recapture or gain market share or to sell other software or hardware products we may then need to lower our prices or offer other favorable terms to compete successfully any such changes would be likely to reduce our profit margins and could adversely affect our operating results any substantial changes to our prices and pricing policies could cause revenues to decline or be delayed as our sales force implements and our customers adjust to the new pricing policies some of our competitors bundle products for promotional purposes or as a longterm pricing strategy or provide guarantees of prices and product implementations these practices could over time significantly constrain the prices that we can charge for our products if we cannot offset price reductions with a corresponding increase in the number of sales or with lower spending then the reduced revenues resulting from lower prices could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

our intelligent system design strategy requires the development or acquisition of products and expertise in new areas of technology our inability to develop or acquire these capabilities could impede our ability to address the technical requirements in technology segments which are expected to contribute to our growth 

our strategy is meant to increase our business among electronic systems companies which are now designing their own ics and other electronic subsystems our strategy is also meant to increase our business among semiconductor companies which are increasing their contribution to the end products into which their ics and other electronic subsystems are incorporated part of this strategy involves addressing the needs of new categories of electronic systems including hyperscale computing and infrastructure edge computing machine learning 5g networks augmented reality virtual reality iot aerospace and defense and autonomous vehicle subsystems where increased investment is expected by our customers each of these categories requires technologies and expertise that are applicationspecific if we are unable to develop or acquire the applicationspecific technologies and expertise necessary to address the requirements of these categories it could impede our ability to expand our business in these categories and ultimately affect our future growth 

we have experienced varied operating results and our operating results for any particular fiscal period are affected by the timing of revenue recognition particularly for our emulation and prototyping hardware and ip products 

various factors affect our operating results and some of them are not within our control our operating results for any period are affected by the mix of products and services sold in a given period and the timing of revenue recognition particularly for our emulation and prototyping hardware and ip products in addition we have recorded net losses in the past and may record net losses in the future also our cash flows from operating activities have and will continue to fluctuate due to a number of factors including the timing of our billings collections disbursements and tax payments 

a substantial portion of the product revenue related to our hardware business and our ip offerings is recognized upon delivery and our forecasted revenue results are based in part on our expectations of hardware and ip to be delivered in a particular quarter therefore changes in hardware and ip bookings or deliveries relative to expectations will have a more immediate impact on our revenue than changes in software or services bookings for which revenue is generally recognized over time 

in recent years we made significant investments to expand our ip offerings through among other things research and development and acquisitions as we continue to expand our ip offerings a portion of the revenue related to our ip bookings will be deferred until we complete and deliver the licensed ip to our customers as a result costs related to the research and development of the ip may be incurred prior to the recognition of the related revenue 

revenue related to our hardware and ip products is inherently difficult to predict because sales of our hardware and ip products depend on the commencement of new projects for the design and development of complex ics and systems by our customers our customers’ willingness to expend capital to deploy our new and existing hardware or ip products in those projects and the availability of our new and existing hardware or ip products for delivery therefore our hardware or ip sales may be delayed or may decrease if our customers delay or cancel projects because their spending is constrained or if there are problems or delays with the supply or delivery of our hardware or ip products or our hardware suppliers moreover the hardware and ip markets are highly competitive and our customers may choose to purchase a competitor’s hardware or ip product based on cost performance or other factors these factors may result in lower revenue which would have an adverse effect on our business results of operations or cash flows 

a substantial proportion of our software licenses yield revenue recognized over time which may make it difficult for us to rapidly increase our revenue in future fiscal periods 

we plan our operating expenses based on forecasted revenue expected business needs and other factors these expenses and the effect of longterm commitments are relatively fixed in the short term bookings and the related revenue are harder to forecast in a difficult economic environment if we experience a shortfall in bookings our operating results could differ from our expectations because we may not be able to quickly reduce our expenses in response to shortterm business changes 

the methods estimates and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies have a significant impact on our results of operations see “critical accounting estimates” under part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” such methods estimates and judgments are by their nature subject to substantial risks uncertainties and assumptions and factors may arise over time that may lead us to change our methods estimates and judgments changes in those methods estimates and judgments could significantly affect our results of operations 

historical results of operations should not be viewed as reliable indicators of our future performance if our revenue operating results or business outlook for future periods fall short of the levels expected by us securities analysts or investors the trading price of our common stock could decline 

we have invested and expect to continue to invest in research and development efforts for new and existing products and technologies and technical sales support such investments may affect our operating results and if the return on these investments is lower or develops more slowly than we expect our revenue and operating results may suffer 

we have invested and expect to continue to invest in research and development for new and existing products technologies and services in response to our customers’ increasing technological requirements such investments may be in related areas such as technical sales support and may include increases in employee headcount these investments may involve significant time risks and uncertainties including the risk that the expenses associated with these investments may affect our margins and operating results and that such investments may not generate sufficient revenues to offset liabilities assumed and expenses associated with these new investments we believe that we must continue to invest a significant amount of time and resources in our research and development efforts and technical sales support to maintain and improve our competitive position if we do not achieve the benefits anticipated from these investments if the achievement of these benefits is delayed or if customers reduce or slow the need to upgrade or enhance their eda products and design flows our revenue and operating results may be adversely affected 

the competition in our industries is substantial and we may not be able to continue to compete successfully in our industries 

the industries in which we do business including software hardware ip and services for enabling the design of electronic products are highly competitive and require us to identify and develop or acquire innovative and costcompetitive products integrate them into platforms and market them in a timely manner we may not be able to compete successfully in these industries which could seriously harm our business operating results or financial condition factors that could affect our ability to compete successfully include 

 we compete most frequently with synopsys inc mentor graphics corporation a division of siemens ag and ansys inc and also with numerous other eda providers manufacturers of electronic devices that have developed acquired or have the capability to develop their own eda products technical software companies electronics design and consulting companies and other ip companies these include altium limited ceva inc keysight technologies inc and zuken ltd 

we have acquired and expect to acquire other companies and businesses and may not realize the expected benefits of these acquisitions 

we have acquired and expect to acquire other companies and businesses in order to expand our product offerings our future revenue growth and expansion of our business is dependent on our successful integration of our acquisitions we may incur significant costs in connection with potential transactions including acquisitions that are not consummated potential and completed acquisitions involve a number of risks if any of the following acquisitionrelated risks occur our business operating results or financial condition could be adversely impacted 



 in a number of our completed acquisitions we have agreed to make future payments either in the form of employee retention bonuses or contingent purchase price payments based on the achievement of specified milestones the performance goals pursuant to which these future payments may be made generally relate to the achievement by the acquired company or business or by the employees who joined us with the acquired company or business of certain specified bookings revenue run rate product proliferation product development or employee retention goals during a specified period following completion of the applicable acquisition the specific performance goal levels and amounts and timing of employee bonuses or contingent purchase price payments vary with each acquisition we may continue to use contingent payments in connection with acquisitions in the future and while we expect to derive value from an acquisition in excess of such contingent payment obligations we may be required to make certain contingent payments without deriving the anticipated value 

future acquisitions may involve issuances of stock as full or partial payment of the purchase price for the acquired company or business grants of restricted stock restricted stock units or stock options to employees of the acquired companies or businesses which may be dilutive to existing stockholders expenditure of substantial cash resources or the incurrence of a material amount of debt these arrangements may impact our liquidity financial position and results of operations or increase dilution of our stockholders’ equity interests in the company 

we make and expect to make strategic investments and may not realize the expected benefits of these investments 

we have made and expect to make strategic investments in which we have a minority equity interest and do not have operational control these strategic investments may also involve collaboration agreements that further and complement our strategy and marketing efforts we may not be able to realize the expected benefits of these investments and the related collaborations may be difficult to manage without sole decisionmaking authority and the economic or business interests in these collaborations may become inconsistent with our interests these challenges could have an adverse effect on our business operating results or financial condition 

the accounting applied to strategic investments depends on a number of factors including but not limited to our percentage of ownership and the level of our influence over the entity losses experienced by these strategic investment entities or associated impairment charges could adversely impact our operating results and the value of our investment in addition if these entities fail and cease operations we may lose the value of our investment and shared profits 

failure to obtain export licenses or restrictions on trade imposed by the united states or other countries could harm our business by rendering us unable to sell or ship products and transfer our technology outside of the united states 

we must comply with regulations of the united states and of certain other countries in selling or shipping our products and transferring our technology outside the united states and to foreign nationals changes in these regulations or restrictions due to changes in trade relationships with the united states including new tariffs trade protection measures import or export licensing requirements sanctions trade embargoes and other trade barriers could harm our business operating results or financial condition 

the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations may adversely impact our revenue expenses cash flows and financial condition 

we have significant operations outside the united states our revenue from international operations as a percentage of total revenue was approximately 58 during fiscal 2019 57 during fiscal 2018 and 58 during fiscal 2017 we expect that revenue from our international operations will continue to account for a significant portion of our total revenue we also transact business in various foreign currencies although the majority of our revenue contracts worldwide are denominated in us dollars volatility of currencies in countries where we conduct business most notably the us dollar chinese renminbi japanese yen european union euro british pound and indian rupee have had and may in the future have an effect on our revenue or operating results 

fluctuations in the rate of exchange between the us dollar and the currencies of other countries where we conduct business could seriously affect our business operating results or financial condition for example when a foreign currency declines in value relative to the us dollar it takes more of the foreign currency to purchase the same amount of us dollars than before the change if we price our products and services in the foreign currency we receive fewer us dollars than we did before the change if we price our products and services in us dollars the decrease in value of the local currency results in an increase in the price for our products and services compared to those products of our competitors that are priced in local currency this could result in our prices being uncompetitive in markets where business is transacted in the local currency on the other hand when a foreign currency increases in value relative to the us dollar it takes more us dollars to purchase the same amount of the foreign currency as we use the foreign currency to fund payroll costs and other operating expenses in our international operations this results in an increase in operating expenses approximately 30 of our total costs and expenses are transacted in foreign currencies our attempts to reduce the effect of foreign currency fluctuations may be unsuccessful and significant exchange rate movements may adversely impact our results of operations as expressed in us dollars 

our operating results could be adversely affected by an increase in our effective tax rate as a result of us and foreign tax law changes outcomes of current or future tax examinations or by material differences between our forecasted and actual effective tax rates 

our operations are subject to income and transaction taxes in the united states and in multiple foreign jurisdictions with a significant amount of our foreign earnings generated by our subsidiaries organized in ireland and hungary any significant change in our future effective tax rates could adversely impact our results of operations for future periods our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by the following 

 the irs and other tax authorities regularly examine our income tax returns and other nonincome tax returns such as payroll sales use valueadded net worth or franchise property goods and services consumption import stamp and excise taxes in both the united states and foreign jurisdictions the calculation of our provision for income taxes and our accruals for other taxes requires us to use significant judgment and involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes we regularly assess the potential settlement outcomes resulting from income tax examinations however the final outcome of tax examinations including the total amount payable or the timing of any such payments upon resolution of these issues cannot be estimated with certainty in addition we cannot be certain that such amount will not be materially different from the amount that is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals for other taxes should the irs or other tax authorities assess additional taxes penalties or interest as a result of a current or a future examination we may be required to record charges to operations in future periods that could have a material impact on our results of operations financial position or cash flows in the applicable period or periods 

forecasts of our annual effective tax rate are complex and subject to uncertainty because our income tax position for each year combines the effects of estimating our annual income or loss the mix of profits and losses earned by us and our subsidiaries in tax jurisdictions with a broad range of income tax rates as well as benefits from available deferred tax assets the impact of various accounting rules our interpretations of changes in tax laws and results of tax audits forecasts of our annual effective tax rate do not include the anticipation of future tax law changes in addition we account for certain tax benefits from stockbased compensation in the period the stock compensation vests or is settled which may cause increased variability in our quarterly effective tax rates if there were a material difference between forecasted and actual tax rates it could have a material impact on our results of operations 

tax laws regulations and compliance practices are evolving and may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flows and financial position 

the us tax cuts and jobs act the “tax act” was enacted in december 2017 and significantly affected us tax law by changing how the united states imposes income tax on multinational corporations the us department of treasury has broad authority to issue regulations and interpretative guidance that may significantly impact how we will apply the law and impact our results of operations as additional interpretative guidance is issued by the applicable authorities we may need to revise our provision benefit for income taxes in future periods these revisions could materially affect our results of operations cash flow and financial position 

tax laws regulations and administrative practices in various jurisdictions are evolving and may be subject to significant changes due to economic political and other conditions there are many transactions that occur during the ordinary course of business for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain and significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our provision and accruals for these taxes governments are increasingly focused on ways to increase tax revenues particularly from multinational corporations which may lead to an increase in audit activity and harsher positions taken by tax authorities we are currently subject to tax audits in various jurisdictions and these jurisdictions may assess additional tax liabilities against us 

the organisation for economic cooperation and development “oecd” an international association of countries including the united states released the final reports from its base erosion and profit shifting “beps” action plans which aim to standardize and modernize global tax policies the beps action plans propose revisions to numerous tax rules including countrybycountry reporting permanent establishment hybrid entities and instruments transfer pricing and tax treaties the beps action plans have been or are being enacted by countries where we have operations the european commission “ec” has conducted investigations in multiple countries focusing on whether local country tax rulings provide preferential tax treatment that violates european union state aid rules and concluded that certain countries including ireland have provided illegal state aid in certain cases the ec and oecd have also been evaluating new rules on the taxation of the digital economy to provide greater taxing rights to jurisdictions where customers or users are located and to address additional base erosion and profits shifting issues in addition many countries have recently introduced new laws or proposals to tax digital transactions these developments in tax laws and regulations and compliance with these rules could have a material adverse effect on our operating results financial position and cash flows 

our stock price has been subject to fluctuations and may continue to be subject to fluctuations 

the market price of our common stock has experienced fluctuations and may fluctuate or decline in the future and as a result stockholders could lose the value of their investment the market price of our common stock may be affected by a number of factors including 

 in addition equity markets in general and the equities of technology companies in particular have experienced and may experience in the future extreme price and volume fluctuations due to among other factors the actions of market participants or other actions outside of our control such price and volume fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock for reasons unrelated to our business or operating results 

our future revenue is dependent in part upon our installed customer base continuing to license or buy products and purchase services 

our installed customer base has traditionally generated additional new license services and maintenance revenues in future periods customers may not necessarily license or buy additional products or contract for additional services or maintenance our customers many of which are large semiconductor and systems companies often have significant bargaining power in negotiations with us customer consolidation can reduce the total level of purchases of our software hardware ip and services and in some cases increase customers’ bargaining power in negotiations with their suppliers including us 

we could suffer serious harm to our business because of the infringement of our intellectual property rights by third parties or because of our infringement of the intellectual property rights of third parties as well as any associated efforts to enforce such rights including through intellectual property litigation 

there are numerous patents relating to our business and ecosystem new patents are being issued at a rapid rate and are owned by eda companies as well as entities and individuals outside the eda industry including parties whose income is primarily derived from infringementrelated licensing and litigation it is not always practicable to determine in advance whether a product or any of its components infringes the patent rights of others as a result from time to time we may be compelled to respond to or prosecute intellectual property infringement claims to protect our rights or defend a customer’s rights 

intellectual property infringement claims including contractual defense reimbursement obligations related to thirdparty claims against our customers regardless of merit could consume valuable management time result in costly litigation or cause product shipment delays all of which could seriously harm our business operating results or financial condition the risk of infringement and related indemnification claims associated with design ip products that are incorporated into a customer product broadly used by consumers may be higher than the risk associated with our software products in settling these claims we may be required to enter into royalty or licensing agreements with the third parties claiming infringement these royalty or licensing agreements if available may not have terms favorable to us being compelled to enter into a license agreement with unfavorable terms could seriously harm our business operating results or financial condition 

any potential intellectual property litigation could compel us to do one or more of the following 



 if we were compelled to take any of these actions our business reputation or operating results might suffer 

if our security measures are breached and an unauthorized party obtains access to customer data financial data or assets or our proprietary business information our information systems may be perceived as being unsecure and our business and reputation could be harmed 

our products and services involve storage including cloudbased storage and transmission of our proprietary information and that of our customers we have offices throughout the world including key research and development facilities outside of the united states our operations are dependent upon the connectivity of our operations throughout the world despite our security measures our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to cyber attacks by unauthorized third parties which may include nationstates and individuals sponsored by them or breaches due to employee error malfeasance or other disruptions which could result in unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information and could significantly interfere with our business operations third parties attempt to gain unauthorized access through a variety of methods such as the use of viruses malware ransomware phishing denial of service attacks and other cyber attacks and corrupt the processes of the products and services that we provide we may also be a target of malicious attacks in an attempt to gain access to our network including our cadence cloud portfolio which includes both our managed and customermanaged environments or data centers or those of our customers or end users steal proprietary information related to our business products services or infrastructure steal financial data or assets or interrupt our systems and services or those of our customers or others breaches of our security measures could expose us to a risk of loss or misuse of this information loss of financial assets business interruption litigation and potential liability because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage information systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventive measures in addition if we select a vendor that uses cloud storage of information as part of their service or product offerings or are selected as a vendor for our cadence cloud portfolio despite our attempts to validate the security of such services our proprietary information may be misappropriated by third parties in the event of an actual or perceived breach of our security or the security of one of our vendors the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed legal or regulatory actions could be initiated against us and we could suffer damage to our reputation or our business or lose existing customers and our ability to obtain new customers or suffer harm to our financial condition 

risks associated with our international operations could adversely impact our financial condition 

a significant amount of our revenue is derived from our international operations and we have offices throughout the world including key research and development facilities outside of the united states our international operations may be subject to a number of risks including 



some of our international research and development and other facilities are in parts of the world where there may be a greater risk of business interruption as a result of political instability terrorist acts or military conflicts than businesses located domestically furthermore this potential harm is exacerbated because damage to or disruptions at our international research and development facilities could have a more significant adverse effect on our ability to develop new or improve existing products than other businesses that may only have sales offices or other less critical operations abroad we are not insured for losses or interruptions caused by acts of war furthermore our operations are dependent upon the connectivity of our operations throughout the world activities that interfere with our international connectivity or operations such as cyber hacking the introduction of a virus into our computer systems natural disasters public health emergencies civil unrest or terrorism could significantly interfere with our business operations 

in addition internal controls policies and procedures and employee training and compliance programs that we have implemented to deter prohibited practices may not prevent our employees contractors or agents from violating or circumventing our policies and the laws and regulations applicable to our worldwide operations 

we depend upon our management team and key employees and our failure to attract train motivate and retain management and key employees may make us less competitive and therefore harm our results of operations 

our business depends upon the continued services efforts and abilities of our senior management and other key employees competition for highly skilled executive officers and employees can be intense particularly in geographic areas recognized as high technology centers such as the silicon valley area where our principal offices are located and in other locations where we maintain facilities in addition competition for qualified personnel including software engineers in the eda commercial electronics engineering services and ip industries has intensified further increased uncertainty regarding social political and immigration policies in the united states and abroad may make it difficult to recruit employees with adequate experience we may also experience increased compensation costs that are not offset by either improved productivity or higher sales we may not be successful in recruiting new personnel and in retaining and motivating existing personnel our ability to do so also depends on how well we maintain a strong workplace culture that is attractive to employees from time to time there may be changes in our management team resulting from the hiring and departure of executive officers and as a result we may experience disruption to our business that may harm our operating results and our relationships with our employees customers and suppliers may be adversely affected 

to attract retain and motivate individuals with the requisite expertise we may be required to grant large numbers of stock options or other stockbased incentive awards which may be dilutive to existing stockholders and increase compensation expense and pay significant base salaries and cash bonuses which could harm our operating results the high cost of training new employees not fully utilizing these employees or losing trained employees to competing employers could also reduce our operating margins and harm our business or operating results 

in addition applicable rules and regulations require stockholder approval for new equity compensation plans and significant amendments to existing equity compensation plans including increases in shares available for issuance under such plans these rules and regulations could make it more difficult for us to grant equity compensation to employees in the future to the extent that these regulations make it more difficult or expensive to grant equity compensation to employees we may incur increased compensation costs or find it difficult to attract retain and motivate employees which could materially and adversely affect our business 

we rely on our proprietary technology as well as software and other intellectual property rights licensed to us by third parties and we cannot assure that the precautions taken to protect our rights will be adequate or that we will continue to be able to adequately secure such intellectual property rights from third parties 

our success depends in part upon our proprietary technology we generally rely on patents copyrights trademarks trade secrets licenses and restrictive agreements to establish and protect our proprietary rights in technology and products despite the precautions we may take to protect our intellectual property third parties have tried in the past and may try in the future to challenge invalidate or circumvent these safeguards our patents and other intellectual property rights may not provide us with sufficient competitive advantages patents may not be issued on any of our pending applications and our issued patents may not be sufficiently broad to protect our technology furthermore the laws of foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights in those countries to the same extent as applicable law protects these rights in the united states and we may encounter difficulties in our attempts to protect our intellectual property in foreign jurisdictions including as a result of impacts from changes in international trade relationships the protection of our intellectual property may require the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources moreover the steps we take to protect our intellectual property may not adequately protect our rights or deter or prevent third parties from infringing or misappropriating our proprietary rights 

many of our products include software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties we may have to seek new or renew existing licenses for such software and other intellectual property in the future our engineering services business holds licenses to certain software and other intellectual property owned by third parties including that of our competitors our failure to obtain software other intellectual property licenses or other intellectual property rights that are necessary or helpful for our business on favorable terms or our need to engage in litigation over these licenses or rights could seriously harm our business operating results or financial condition 

we have substantial cash requirements in the united states but a significant portion of our cash is held and generated outside of the united states and if our cash available in the united states and the cash available under our revolving credit facility are insufficient to meet our operating expenses and debt repayment obligations in the united states then we may be required to raise cash in ways that could negatively affect our financial condition results of operations and the market price of our common stock 

we have significant operations outside the united states as of december 28 2019  approximately 43 of our cash and cash equivalents balance was held by subsidiaries outside the united states with the remainder of the balance held by us or our subsidiaries in the united states we believe that the combination of our us cash cash equivalents future us operating cash flows cash available under our revolving credit facility and other cash that may be accessible to us on attractive terms are sufficient to meet our ongoing us operating expenses and debt repayment obligations although the tax act may have reduced the tax impact of repatriation of foreign earnings there are still administrative processes associated with repatriation of foreign earnings that could affect the timing of returning cash to the us from nonus jurisdictions accordingly if our us cash were insufficient to meet our future funding obligations in the united states we could be required to seek funding sources on less attractive terms which could negatively impact our results of operations financial position and the market price of our common stock 

litigation could adversely affect our financial condition or operations 

we currently are and in the future may be involved in various disputes and litigation that arise in the ordinary course of business these include disputes and lawsuits related to intellectual property including customer indemnification mergers and acquisitions licensing contracts distribution arrangements and employee relations matters for information regarding the litigation matters in which we are currently engaged please refer to the discussion under part i item 3 “legal proceedings” and note 18 in the notes to consolidated financial statements we cannot provide any assurances that the final outcome of these lawsuits or any other proceedings that may arise in the future will not have a material adverse effect on our business reputation operating results financial condition or cash flows litigation can be time consuming and expensive and could divert management’s time and attention from our business which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and operating results 

errors or defects in our products and services could expose us to liability and harm our business 

our customers use our products and services in designing and developing products that involve a high degree of technological complexity each of which has its own specifications because of the complexity of the systems and products with which we work some of our products and designs can be adequately tested only when put to full use in the marketplace as a result our customers or their end users may discover errors or defects in our software or the systems we design or the products or systems incorporating our design and intellectual property may not operate as expected errors or defects could result in 

 our operating results and revenue could be adversely affected by customer payment delays customer bankruptcies and defaults or modifications of licenses 

occasionally our customers file for bankruptcy or face other challenging financial or operating conditions if our customers experience adversity in their business they may delay or default on their payment obligations to us request to modify contract terms or modify or cancel plans to license our products for instance if our customers are not successful in generating sufficient cash or are precluded from securing financing they may not be able to pay or may delay payment of accounts receivable that are owed to us although these obligations are generally not cancelable our customers’ inability to fulfill payment obligations in turn may adversely affect our revenue operating expenses and cash flow additionally our customers have in the past sought and may in the future seek to renegotiate preexisting contractual commitments payment defaults by our customers or significant reductions in existing contractual commitments could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results 

the long sales cycle of our products and services may cause our operating results to fluctuate unexpectedly 

generally we have a long sales cycle that can extend up to six months or longer the complexity and expense associated with our products and services generally require a lengthy customer education evaluation and approval process consequently we may incur substantial expenses and devote significant management effort and expense to develop potential relationships that do not result in agreements or revenue and may prevent us from pursuing other opportunities 

in addition sales of our products and services have been and may in the future be delayed if customers delay approval or commencement of projects because of 



long sales cycles for hardware products subject us to a number of significant risks over which we have limited control including insufficient excess or obsolete inventory variations in inventory valuation and fluctuations in quarterly operating results 

our reported financial results may be adversely affected by changes in united states generally accepted accounting principles and we may incur significant costs to adjust our accounting systems and processes to comply with significant changes 

united states generally accepted accounting principles “us gaap” are subject to interpretation by the financial accounting standards board “fasb” the sec and various bodies formed to promulgate and interpret appropriate accounting principles we are also subject to evolving rules and regulations of the countries in which we do business changes to accounting standards or interpretations thereof may result in different accounting principles under us gaap that could have a significant effect on our reported financial results 

in addition we have in the past and may in the future need to significantly change our customer contracts accounting systems and processes when we adopt future or proposed changes in accounting principles the cost and effect of these changes may negatively impact our results of operations during the periods of transition 

our restructuring plans incur substantial costs and may not result in the benefits we have anticipated possibly having a negative effect on our future operating results 

in recent fiscal years we have initiated restructuring plans in an effort to reallocate or decrease costs by reducing our workforce and by consolidating facilities we incur substantial costs to implement restructuring plans and our restructuring activities may subject us to reputational risks and litigation risks and expenses our past restructuring plans do not provide any assurance that we will realize anticipated cost savings and other benefits or that additional restructuring plans will not be required or implemented in the future in addition our restructuring plans may have other consequences such as attrition beyond our planned reduction in workforce a negative effect on employee morale and productivity or our ability to attract highly skilled employees our competitors may also use our restructuring plans to seek to gain a competitive advantage over us as a result our restructuring plans may affect our revenue and other operating results in the future 

we depend on a single supplier or a limited number of suppliers for certain hardware components and contract manufacturers for production of our emulation and prototyping hardware products making us vulnerable to supply disruption and price fluctuation 

we depend on a single supplier or a limited number of suppliers for certain hardware components and contract manufacturers for production of our emulation and prototyping hardware products our reliance on single or a limited number of suppliers and contract manufacturers could result in product delivery problems and delays and reduced control over product pricing and quality though we prefer to have multiple sources to procure certain key components in some cases it is not practical or feasible to do so we may suffer a disruption in the supply of certain hardware components if we are unable to purchase sufficient components on a timely basis or at all for any reason any supply or manufacturing disruption including delay in delivery of components by our suppliers or products by our manufacturers or the bankruptcy or shutdown of our suppliers or manufacturers could delay our production process and prevent us from delivering completed hardware products to customers or from supplying new evaluation units to customers which could have a negative impact on our revenue and operating results 

if we become subject to unfair hiring claims we could be prevented from hiring needed employees incur liability for damages and incur substantial costs in defending ourselves 

when companies in our industry lose employees to competitors they frequently claim that these competitors have engaged in unfair hiring practices or that the employment of these persons would involve the disclosure or use of trade secrets these claims could prevent us from hiring employees or cause us to incur liability for damages we could also incur substantial costs in defending ourselves or our employees against these claims regardless of their merits defending ourselves from these claims could also divert the attention of our management away from our operations 

antitakeover defenses in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and certain provisions under delaware law could prevent an acquisition of our company or limit the price that investors might be willing to pay for our common stock 

our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and certain provisions of the delaware general corporation law that apply to us could make it difficult for another company to acquire control of our company for example 



all or any one of these factors could limit the price that certain investors would be willing to pay for shares of our common stock and could allow our board of directors to resist delay or prevent an acquisition of our company even if a proposed transaction were favored by a majority of our independent stockholders 

the investment of our cash is subject to risks that may cause losses and affect the liquidity of these investments 

our marketable investments include various money market funds and may include other investments as well weakened financial markets have at times adversely impacted the general credit liquidity market prices and interest rates for these and other types of investments additionally changes in monetary policy by the federal open market committee or other relevant regulators and concerns about the rising us government debt level may cause a decrease in the purchasing power of the us dollar and adversely affect our investment portfolio the financial market and monetary risks associated with our investment portfolio may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition liquidity results of operations or cash flows 

we are subject to evolving corporate governance and public disclosure expectations and regulations that impact compliance costs and risks of noncompliance 

we are subject to changing rules and regulations promulgated by a number of governmental and selfregulatory organizations including the sec nasdaq and the fasb as well as evolving investor expectations around corporate governance executive compensation and environmental and social practices and disclosures these rules and regulations continue to evolve in scope and complexity and many new requirements have been created in response to laws enacted by the us and foreign governments making compliance more difficult and uncertain the increase in costs to comply with such evolving expectations rules and regulations as well as any risk of noncompliance could adversely impact us 

our business is subject to the risk of earthquakes and other catastrophic events 

our corporate headquarters including certain of our research and development operations and certain of our distribution facilities is located in the silicon valley area of northern california a region known to experience seismic activity if significant seismic activity were to occur our operations may be interrupted which could adversely impact our business and results of operations 

our other offices in the united states and in other countries around the world may be adversely impacted by natural disasters including fires earthquakes flooding and other climate changerelated risks or actions by utility providers as well as other catastrophic events such as an actual or threatened public health emergency if a catastrophic event occurs at or near any of our offices or utility providers or public health officials take certain actions eg shut off power to our facilities or impose travel restrictions our operations may be interrupted which could adversely impact our business and results of operations if a catastrophic event impacts a significant number of our customers resulting in decreased demand for their and our products or our ability to provide services and maintenance to our customers our business and results of operations could be adversely impacted for example the continued spread of the coronavirus and related public health measures could result in further disruptions to our operations and those of our customers 

risks related to our securities and indebtedness 

our debt obligations expose us to risks that could adversely affect our business operating results or financial condition and could prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under such indebtedness 

as of december 28 2019  we had total outstanding indebtedness of 3460 million  we also had the ability to borrow an additional 3500 million under our revolving credit facility with the right to request increased capacity up to an additional 2500 million upon the receipt of lender commitments for total maximum borrowings of 6000 million under our revolving credit facility subject to the limits contained in the credit agreement governing our revolving credit facility the indenture that governs the 2024 notes and our other debt instruments we may be able to incur substantial additional debt from time to time to finance working capital capital expenditures investments or acquisitions share repurchases or for other purposes if we do so the risks related to our high level of debt could intensify specifically our high level of debt could have important consequences including the following 

 acquisitions or other general corporate requirements 

 purposes thereby reducing the amount of cash flows available for working capital capital expenditures 

acquisitions and other general corporate purposes 

 our revolving credit facility are at variable rates of interest 



at the option of the holders of our outstanding notes we may under certain circumstances be required to repurchase such notes 

under the terms of our 2024 notes we may be required to repurchase for cash such notes prior to their maturity in connection with the occurrence of certain significant corporate events specifically we are required to offer to repurchase such notes upon a “change of control triggering event” as defined in the indenture related to such notes such as a change of control accompanied by certain downgrades in the credit ratings of such notes the repayment obligations under such notes may have the effect of discouraging delaying or preventing a takeover of our company if we were required to pay the 2024 notes prior to their scheduled maturity it could have a significant negative impact on our cash and liquidity and could impact our ability to invest financial resources in other strategic initiatives 

the terms of the agreement governing our revolving credit facility and the indenture governing our 2024 notes restrict our current and future operations particularly our ability to respond to changes or to take certain actions 

the agreement governing our revolving credit facility contains a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and may limit our ability to engage in acts that may be in our longterm best interest including restrictions on our ability to 

 in addition the restrictive covenants in the agreement governing our revolving credit facility require us to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy other financial condition tests our ability to meet those financial ratios and tests can be affected by events beyond our control and we may be unable to meet them 

a breach of the covenants or restrictions under the agreement governing our revolving credit facility could result in an event of default under the applicable indebtedness such a default may allow the creditors to accelerate the related debt and may result in the acceleration of any other debt to which a crossacceleration or crossdefault provision applies in addition an event of default under the credit agreement governing our revolving credit facility would permit the lenders under our revolving credit facility to terminate all commitments to extend further credit under that facility in the event our lenders or note holders accelerate the repayment of our borrowings we and our subsidiaries may not have sufficient assets to repay that indebtedness as a result of these restrictions we may be 

 the indenture governing our 2024 notes also contains certain restrictive covenants that impose operating and financial restrictions on us and may limit our ability to engage in acts that may be in our longterm best interest including restrictions on our ability to incur liens and to enter into sale and leaseback transactions 

these restrictions may affect our ability to grow in accordance with our strategy in addition our financial results our substantial indebtedness and our credit ratings could adversely affect the availability and terms of our financing 

we may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness which may not be successful 

our ability to make scheduled payments on or refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial condition and operating performance which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial business legislative regulatory and other factors beyond our control we may be unable to maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal premium if any and interest on our indebtedness 

if our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations we could face substantial liquidity problems and could be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures or to dispose of material assets or operations seek additional debt or equity capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness we may not be able to effect any such alternative measures if necessary on commercially reasonable terms or at all and even if successful those alternative actions may not allow us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations the agreement governing our revolving credit facility restricts our ability to dispose of assets and use the proceeds from those dispositions and may also restrict our ability to raise debt or equity capital to be used to repay other indebtedness when it becomes due we may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain proceeds in an amount sufficient to meet any debt service obligations then due 

in addition we conduct a substantial portion of our operations through our subsidiaries none of which are currently guarantors of our indebtedness accordingly repayment of our indebtedness is dependent on the generation of cash flow by our subsidiaries and their ability to make such cash available to us by dividend debt repayment or otherwise unless they become guarantors of our indebtedness our subsidiaries do not have any obligation to pay amounts due on our indebtedness or to make funds available for that purpose our subsidiaries may not be able to or may not be permitted to make distributions to enable us to make payments in respect of our indebtedness each subsidiary is a distinct legal entity and under certain circumstances legal and contractual restrictions may limit our ability to obtain cash from our subsidiaries while the agreement governing our revolving credit facility limits the ability of our subsidiaries to incur consensual restrictions on their ability to pay dividends or make other intercompany payments to us these limitations are subject to qualifications and exceptions in the event that we do not receive distributions from our subsidiaries we may be unable to make required principal and interest payments on our indebtedness 

our inability to generate sufficient cash flows to satisfy our debt obligations or to refinance our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all would materially and adversely affect our financial position and results of operations and our ability to satisfy our debt obligations 

if we cannot make scheduled payments on our debt we will be in default and holders of our debt could declare all outstanding principal and interest to be due and payable the lenders under our revolving credit facility could terminate their commitments to loan money and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation in addition a material default on our indebtedness could suspend our eligibility to register securities using certain registration statement forms under sec guidelines that permit incorporation by reference of substantial information regarding us potentially hindering our ability to raise capital through the issuance of our securities and increasing our costs of registration 

despite our current level of indebtedness we and our subsidiaries may incur substantially more debt this could further exacerbate the risks to our financial condition described above 

we and our subsidiaries may incur significant additional indebtedness in the future although the agreement governing our revolving credit facility contains restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions and the additional indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial if we incur any additional indebtedness that ranks equally with the 2024 notes then subject to any collateral arrangements we may enter into the holders of that debt will be entitled to share ratably in any proceeds distributed in connection with any insolvency liquidation reorganization dissolution or other winding up of our company 

our variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly 

borrowings under our revolving credit facility are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk if interest rates were to increase our debt service obligations on our variable rate indebtedness would increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same and our net income and cash flows including cash available for servicing our indebtedness would correspondingly decrease assuming all loans were fully drawn and we were to fully exercise our right to increase borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility each quarter point change in interest rates would result in a 15 million change in annual interest expense on our indebtedness under our revolving credit facility in the future we may enter into interest rate swaps that involve the exchange of floating for fixed rate interest payments in order to reduce interest rate volatility however we may not maintain interest rate swaps with respect to all of our variable rate indebtedness and any swaps we enter into may not fully mitigate our interest rate risk 

our revolving credit facility utilizes libor or various alternative methods to calculate the amount of accrued interest on any borrowings regulators in certain jurisdictions including the united kingdom and the united states have announced the desire to phase out the use of libor by the end of 2021 the transition from libor to a new replacement benchmark is uncertain at this time and the consequences of such developments cannot be entirely predicted but could result in an increase in the cost of our borrowings under our existing credit facility and any future borrowings 

various factors could increase our future borrowing costs or reduce our access to capital including a lowering or withdrawal of the ratings assigned to our 2024 notes by credit rating agencies 

we may in the future seek additional financing for a variety of reasons and our future borrowing costs and access to capital could be affected by factors including the condition of the debt and equity markets the condition of the economy generally prevailing interest rates our level of indebtedness and our business and financial condition in addition the 2024 notes currently have an investment grade credit rating and any credit rating assigned could be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a credit rating agency if in that credit rating agency’s judgment future circumstances relating to the basis of the credit rating such as adverse changes so warrant consequently real or anticipated changes in our credit ratings will generally affect the market value of the 2024 notes any future lowering of the credit ratings of the 2024 notes likely would make it more difficult or more expensive for us to obtain additional debt financing

we believe that these facilities are adequate for our current needs and that suitable additional or substitute space will be available as needed to accommodate any expansion of our operations 




 item 3 legal proceedings 

from time to time we are involved in various disputes and litigation that arise in the ordinary course of business these include disputes and lawsuits related to intellectual property indemnification obligations mergers and acquisitions licensing contracts distribution arrangements and employee relations matters at least quarterly we review the status of each significant matter and assess its potential financial exposure if the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount or the range of loss can be estimated we accrue a liability for the estimated loss legal proceedings are subject to uncertainties and the outcomes are difficult to predict because of such uncertainties accruals are based on our judgments using the best information available at the time as additional information becomes available we reassess the potential liability related to pending claims and litigation matters and may revise estimates

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

  

the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k and with part i item 1a “risk factors” please refer to the cautionary language at the beginning of part i of this annual report on form 10k regarding forwardlooking statements 

business overview 

we enable our customers to develop electronic products our products and services are designed to give our customers a competitive edge in their development of electronic devices and systems socs ics and increasingly sophisticated manufactured products our products and services do this by optimizing performance minimizing power consumption shortening the time to bring our customers’ products to market and reducing their design development and manufacturing costs we offer software hardware services and reusable ic design blocks which are commonly referred to as ip 

our strategy which we call intelligent system design ™  is to provide the technologies necessary for our electronic system and semiconductor customers to develop electronic products across a variety of vertical markets including mobile consumer automotive aerospace and defense industrial and medical segments our products and services enable our customers to develop complex and innovative electronic products so demand for our technology is driven by our customers’ investment in new designs and products historically the industry that provided the tools used by ic engineers was referred to as eda today our offerings include and extend beyond eda 

we combine our products and technologies into categories related to major design activities 

 for additional information about our products see the discussion in item 1 “business” under the heading “products and product strategy” 

on january 15 2020 we completed our acquisition of awr on february 6 2020 we also acquired integrand software the aggregate cash consideration for these acquisitions of approximately 195 million will be allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their respective estimated fair values on the acquisition dates these acquisitions enhance our technology portfolio to address growing rfmicrowave design activity driven by expanding use of 5g communications we expect these acquisitions will result in more expenses including amortization of acquired intangible assets than revenue during fiscal 2020 

we have identified certain items that management uses as performance indicators to manage our business including revenue certain elements of operating expenses and cash flow from operations and we describe these items further below under the headings “results of operations” and “liquidity and capital resources” 

results of operations 

the discussion of our fiscal 2019 consolidated results of operations include yearoveryear comparisons versus fiscal 2018 for revenue cost of revenue operating expenses other nonoperating expenses income taxes and cash flows for a discussion of the fiscal 2018 changes compared to fiscal 2017 see the discussion in item 7 “managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in our annual report on form 10k for the fiscal year ended december 29 2018 filed on february 27 2019 

results of operations for fiscal 2019  as compared to fiscal 2018  reflect the following 

 our fiscal years are 52 or 53week periods ending on the saturday closest to december 31 fiscal 2019 and 2018 were each 52week fiscal years fiscal 2020 will be a 53week fiscal year 

revenue 

we primarily generate revenue from licensing our software and ip selling or leasing our emulation and prototyping hardware technology providing maintenance for our software hardware and ip providing engineering services and earning royalties generated from the use of our ip the timing of our revenue is significantly affected by the mix of software hardware and ip products generating revenue in any given period and whether the revenue is recognized over time or at a point in time upon completion of delivery 

between 85 and 90 of our revenue is characterized as recurring revenue revenue characterized as recurring includes revenue recognized over time from our software arrangements services royalties maintenance on ip licenses and hardware and operating leases of hardware and revenue recognized at varying points in time over the term of our ip access agreements 

the remainder of our revenue is characterized as upfront revenue upfront revenue is primarily generated by our sales of emulation and prototyping hardware and individual ip licenses the percentage of our recurring and upfront revenue may be impacted by delivery of hardware and ip products to our customers in any single fiscal period 

revenue by year 

the following table shows our revenue for fiscal 2019 and 2018 and the change in revenue between years 



product and maintenance revenue increased during fiscal 2019  as compared to fiscal 2018  primarily because of increased investments by our customers in new complex designs for their products that include the design of electronic systems for ai 5g networks aerospace and defense automotive cloud data center and other market segments this demand has resulted in revenue growth in each geographic area and each of our five product categories services revenue may fluctuate from period to period based on the timing of fulfillment of our services and ip performance obligations 

no one customer accounted for 10 or more of total revenue during fiscal 2019 or 2018  

revenue by product category 

the following table shows the percentage of product and related maintenance revenue contributed by each of our five product categories and services during fiscal 2019 and 2018  



revenue by product group fluctuates from period to period based on demand for our products and services and our available resources to deliver and support them certain of our licensing arrangements allow customers the ability to remix among software products additionally we have arrangements with customers that include a combination of our products with the actual product selection and number of licensed users to be determined at a later date for these arrangements we estimate the allocation of the revenue to product groups based upon the expected usage of our products the actual usage of our products by these customers may differ and if that proves to be the case the revenue allocation in the table above would differ 

revenue by geography 



for the primary factors contributing to the increase in revenue for each geographic area during fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018 see the general description under “revenue by year above revenue in china increased during fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018 primarily due to an increase in revenue for ip digital ic design and signoff and system interconnect software products revenue growth in china slowed during the second half of fiscal 2019 because we were unable to deliver maintenance or support for certain customers in china due to the us department of commerce’s designation of certain customers to the “entity list” we expect these restrictions will continue to impact revenue from certain customers in china in fiscal 2020 

revenue by geography as a percent of total revenue 



most of our revenue is transacted in the united states dollar however certain revenue transactions are denominated in foreign currencies for an additional description of how changes in foreign exchange rates affect our consolidated financial statements see the discussion under item 7a “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk – foreign currency risk” 

cost of revenue 

  

the following table shows cost of revenue as a percentage of related revenue for fiscal 2019 and 2018  

  

cost of product and maintenance 

cost of product and maintenance includes costs associated with the sale and lease of our emulation and prototyping hardware and licensing of our software and ip products certain employee salary and benefits and other employeerelated costs cost of our customer support services amortization of technologyrelated and maintenancerelated acquired intangibles costs of technical documentation and royalties payable to thirdparty vendors costs associated with our emulation and prototyping hardware products include components assembly testing applicable reserves and overhead these costs make our cost of emulation and prototyping hardware products higher as a percentage of revenue than our cost of software and ip products 

a summary of cost of product and maintenance for fiscal 2019 and 2018 is as follows 



cost of product and maintenance depends primarily on our hardware product sales in any given period cost of product and maintenance is also affected by employee salary and benefits and other employeerelated costs reserves for inventory as well as the timing and extent to which we acquire intangible assets acquire or license thirdparties’ ip or technology and sell our products that include such acquired or licensed ip or technology 

the changes in product and maintenancerelated costs were due to the following 



costs of emulation and prototyping increased during fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018 primarily due to increased reserves for inventory and the mix of products generating revenue 

cost of services 

cost of services primarily includes employee salary benefits and other employeerelated costs to perform work on revenuegenerating projects and costs to maintain the infrastructure necessary to manage a services organization cost of services may fluctuate from period to period based on our utilization of design services engineers on revenuegenerating projects rather than internal development projects 

operating expenses 

our operating expenses include marketing and sales research and development and general and administrative expenses factors that tend to cause our operating expenses to fluctuate include changes in the number of employees due to hiring and acquisitions foreign exchange rate movements stockbased compensation restructuring activities and the impact of our variable compensation programs that are driven by operating results 

many of our operating expenses are transacted in various foreign currencies we recognize lower expenses in periods when the united states dollar strengthens in value against other currencies and we recognize higher expenses when the united states dollar weakens against other currencies for an additional description of how changes in foreign exchange rates affect our consolidated financial statements see the discussion in item 7a “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk – foreign currency risk” 

our operating expenses for fiscal 2019 and 2018 were as follows 



our operating expenses as a percentage of total revenue for fiscal 2019 and 2018 were as follows 



  

marketing and sales 

the changes in marketing and sales expense were due to the following 



salary benefits and other employeerelated costs included in marketing and sales increased during fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018 primarily due to additional headcount as a result of hiring and an increase in employee incentive compensation 

research and development 

the changes in research and development expense were due to the following 



costs included in research and development increased during fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018 primarily due to additional headcount as a result of hiring 

general and administrative 

the changes in general and administrative expense were due to the following 



professional services included in general and administrative costs increased during fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018 primarily due to consulting fees related to an internal realignment of our international operating structure for further discussion regarding the realignment of our international operating structure see note 6 in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

amortization of acquired intangibles 



the decrease in amortization of acquired intangibles was due to certain intangible assets becoming fully amortized during fiscal 2019 and 2018 

restructuring and other charges 

we have initiated restructuring plans in recent years to better align our resources with our business strategy because the restructuring charges and related benefits are derived from management’s estimates made during the formulation of the restructuring plans based on thencurrently available information our restructuring plans may not achieve the benefits anticipated on the timetable or at the level contemplated additional actions including further restructuring of our operations may be required in the future 

the following table presents restructuring and other charges net for our restructuring plans 



for an additional description of our restructuring plans see note 13 in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

interest expense 

interest expense for fiscal 2019 and 2018 was comprised of the following 



during fiscal 2018 we prepaid the outstanding principal balance and accrued interest on our 3000 million 2019 term loan for an additional description of our debt arrangements see note 3 in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

income taxes 

the following table presents the provision benefit for income taxes and the effective tax rate for fiscal 2019 and 2018  



during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 we completed intercompany transfers of certain intangible property rights to our irish subsidiary which resulted in the establishment of a net deferred tax asset and the recognition of an income tax benefit of 5756 million  we expect to be able to realize the deferred tax asset in future periods and did not provide for a valuation allowance 

this income tax benefit was partially offset by the federal state and foreign income taxes on our fiscal 2019 income we also recognized 368 million of tax benefit related to stockbased compensation that vested or was exercised during the year 

our provision for income taxes for fiscal 2018 primarily resulted from the federal state and foreign income taxes on our fiscal 2018 income partially offset by 213 million of tax benefit related to stockbased compensation that vested or was exercised during the year during fiscal 2018 we finalized our fiscal 2017 deemed repatriation transition tax calculation and reduced our estimate from 672 million to 658 million we finalized our other fiscal 2017 provisional estimates without change for further discussion regarding our accounting for the tax act see note 6 in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

our future effective tax rates may be materially impacted by tax amounts associated with our foreign earnings at rates different from the united states federal statutory rate research credits the tax impact of stockbased compensation accounting for uncertain tax positions business combinations closure of statutes of limitations or settlement of tax audits changes in valuation allowance and changes in tax law a significant amount of our foreign earnings is generated by our subsidiaries organized in ireland and hungary our future effective tax rates may be adversely affected if our earnings were to be lower in countries where we have lower statutory tax rates we currently expect that our fiscal 2020 effective tax rate will be approximately 20 we expect that our quarterly effective tax rates will vary from our fiscal 2020 effective tax rate as a result of recognizing the income tax effects of stockbased awards in the quarterly periods that the awards vest or are settled and other items that we cannot anticipate for additional discussion about how our effective tax rate could be affected by various risks see part i item 1a “risk factors” for further discussion regarding our income taxes see note 6 in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

liquidity and capital resources 



cash and cash equivalents 

as of december 28 2019  our principal sources of liquidity consisted of 7052 million of cash and cash equivalents as compared to 5333 million as of december 29 2018  

our primary sources of cash and cash equivalents during fiscal 2019 were cash generated from operations proceeds from borrowings under our revolving credit facility proceeds from the exercise of stock options and proceeds from stock purchases under our employee stock purchase plan 

our primary uses of cash and cash equivalents during fiscal 2019 were payments related to salaries and benefits operating expenses repurchases of our common stock payments on our revolving credit facility purchases of property plant and equipment and purchases of nonmarketable investments 

approximately 43 of our cash and cash equivalents were held by our foreign subsidiaries as of december 28 2019  our cash and cash equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries may vary from period to period due to the timing of collections and repatriation of foreign earnings we expect that current cash and cash equivalent balances cash flows that are generated from operations and cash borrowings available under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to meet our domestic and international working capital needs and other capital and liquidity requirements including acquisitions and share repurchases for at least the next 12 months 

net working capital 

net working capital is comprised of current assets less current liabilities as shown on our consolidated balance sheets the increase in our net working capital as of december 28 2019  as compared to december 29 2018  is primarily due to improved results from operations the timing of cash receipts from customers and disbursements made to vendors 

cash flows from operating activities 

cash flows from operating activities during fiscal 2019 and 2018 were as follows 



cash flows from operating activities include net income adjusted for certain noncash items as well as changes in the balances of certain assets and liabilities our cash flows from operating activities are significantly influenced by business levels and the payment terms set forth in our customer agreements the increase in cash flows from operating activities during fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018 was primarily due to the improved results from operations and timing of cash receipts from customers and disbursements made to vendors 

cash flows from investing activities 

cash flows used for investing activities during fiscal 2019 and 2018 were as follows 



the decrease in cash used for investing activities during fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018 was primarily due to a decrease in payments to acquire equity instruments of other entities we expect to continue our investing activities including purchasing property plant and equipment purchasing intangible assets business combinations purchasing software licenses and making strategic investments during the first quarter of fiscal 2020 we completed two business combinations for cash consideration of approximately 195 million  which will be classified as cash used for investing activities 

cash flows from financing activities 

cash flows used for financing activities during fiscal 2019 and 2018 were as follows 



the decrease in cash used for financing activities during fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018 was primarily due to a decrease in net cash paid for debt arrangements partially offset by an increase in payments for repurchases of our common stock 

other factors affecting liquidity and capital resources 

stock repurchase program 

in february 2019 our board of directors authorized the repurchase of 500 million of our common stock the actual timing and amount of future repurchases are subject to business and market conditions corporate and regulatory requirements stock price acquisition opportunities and other factors as of december 28 2019  approximately 3690 million remained available under this authorization see part ii item 5 “market for registrant’s common equity related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities” for additional information 

revolving credit facility 

our senior unsecured revolving credit facility provides for borrowings up to 3500 million  with the right to request increased capacity up to an additional 2500 million upon the receipt of lender commitments for total maximum borrowings of 6000 million  the credit facility expires on january 28 2022 and currently has no subsidiary guarantors any outstanding loans drawn under the credit facility are due at maturity on january 28 2022 outstanding borrowings may be paid at any time prior to maturity as of december 28 2019  there were no borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility and we were in compliance with all financial covenants associated with the revolving credit facility 

2024 notes 

in october 2014 we issued 3500 million aggregate principal amount of 4375 senior notes due october 15 2024 we received net proceeds of 3424 million from the issuance of the 2024 notes net of a discount of 14 million and issuance costs of 62 million  interest is payable in cash semiannually the 2024 notes are unsecured and rank equal in right of payment to all of our existing and future senior indebtedness as of december 28 2019  we were in compliance with all covenants associated with the 2024 notes 

for additional information relating to our debt arrangements see note 3 in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

contractual obligations 

a summary of our contractual obligations as of december 28 2019 is as follows 



 



offbalance sheet arrangements 

as of december 28 2019  we did not have any significant offbalance sheet arrangements as defined in item 303a4ii of sec regulation sk 

critical accounting estimates 

in preparing our consolidated financial statements we make assumptions judgments and estimates that can have a significant impact on our revenue operating income and net income as well as on the value of certain assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets we base our assumptions judgments and estimates on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions at least quarterly we evaluate our assumptions judgments and estimates and make changes as deemed necessary 

we believe that the assumptions judgments and estimates involved in the accounting for income taxes revenue recognition and business combinations have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements therefore we consider these to be our critical accounting estimates for information on our significant accounting policies see note 2 in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

accounting for income taxes 

we are subject to income taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our provision for these taxes there are many transactions that occur during the ordinary course of business for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain the tax act has provisions that require additional guidance on specific interpretations of the tax law changes our provision for income taxes could be adversely affected by our earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries where we have higher statutory rates losses incurred in jurisdictions for which we are not able to realize the related tax benefit changes in foreign currency exchange rates entry into new businesses and geographies and changes to our existing businesses acquisitions and investments changes in our deferred tax assets and liabilities including changes in our assessment of valuation allowances changes in the relevant tax laws or interpretations of these tax laws and developments in current and future tax examinations 

we only recognize the tax benefit of an income tax position if we judge that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained solely on its technical merits in a tax audit including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes to make this judgment we must interpret complex and sometimes ambiguous tax laws regulations and administrative practices if we judge that an income tax position meets this recognition threshold then we must measure the amount of the tax benefit to be recognized by estimating the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50 cumulative probability of being realized upon settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all of the relevant facts it is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts as this requires us to determine the probability of various possible settlement outcomes we must reevaluate our income tax positions on a quarterly basis to consider factors such as changes in facts or circumstances changes in tax law effectively settled issues under audit the lapse of applicable statute of limitations and new audit activity such a change in recognition or measurement would result in recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision for a more detailed description of our unrecognized tax benefits see note 6 in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

during fiscal 2019 we completed intercompany transfers of certain intangible property rights to our irish subsidiary which resulted in the establishment of a deferred tax asset and the recognition of an income tax benefit of 5756 million  to determine the value of the deferred tax asset we were required to make significant estimates in determining the fair value of the transferred ip rights these estimates included but are not limited to the income and cash flows that the ip rights are expected to generate in the future the appropriate discount rate to apply to the income and cash flow projections and the useful lives of the ip rights these estimates are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and if different estimates were used it would impact the fair value of the ip rights and the related value of the deferred tax asset and the income tax benefit recognized in fiscal 2019 and in future periods when the deferred tax asset is realized in addition we reviewed the need to establish a valuation allowance on the deferred tax asset of 5756 million by evaluating whether there is a greater than 50 likelihood that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized to make this judgment we must make significant estimates and predictions of the amount and category of future taxable income from various sources and weigh all available positive and negative evidence about these possible sources of taxable income we give greater weight to evidence that can be objectively verified based on our evaluation and weighting of the positive and negative evidence we concluded that it is greater than 50 likely that the deferred tax asset of 5756 million will be realized in future periods and that a valuation allowance was not currently required if in the future we evaluate that this deferred tax asset is not likely to be realized an increase in the related valuation allowance could result in a material income tax expense in the period such determination is made 

revenue recognition 

our contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple software andor ip licenses hardware and services including professional services technical support services and rights to unspecified updates to a customer determining whether licenses and services are distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately or not distinct and thus accounted for together requires significant judgment in some arrangements such as most of our ip license arrangements we have concluded that the licenses and associated services are distinct from each other in other arrangements like our timebased software arrangements the licenses and certain services are not distinct from each other our timebased software arrangements include multiple software licenses and updates to the licensed software products as well as technical support and we have concluded that these promised goods and services are a single combined performance obligation 

judgment is required to determine the standalone selling prices “ssps” for each distinct performance obligation we rarely license or sell products on a standalone basis so we are required to estimate the ssp for each performance obligation in instances where the ssp is not directly observable because we do not sell the license product or service separately we determine the ssp using information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs we typically have more than one ssp for individual performance obligations due to the stratification of those items by classes of customers and circumstances in these instances we may use information such as the size of the customer and geographic region of the customer in determining the ssp 

revenue is recognized over time for our combined performance obligations that include software licenses updates and technical support as well as for maintenance and professional services that are separate performance obligations for our professional services revenue is recognized over time generally using costs incurred or hours expended to measure progress judgment is required in estimating project status and the costs necessary to complete projects a number of internal and external factors can affect these estimates including labor rates utilization and efficiency variances and specification and testing requirement changes for our other performance obligations recognized over time revenue is generally recognized using a timebased measure of progress reflecting generally consistent efforts to satisfy those performance obligations throughout the arrangement term 

if a group of agreements are so closely related that they are in effect part of a single arrangement such agreements are deemed to be one arrangement for revenue recognition purposes we exercise significant judgment to evaluate the relevant facts and circumstances in determining whether the separate agreements should be accounted for separately or as in substance a single arrangement our judgments about whether a group of contracts comprise a single arrangement can affect the allocation of consideration to the distinct performance obligations which could have an effect on results of operations for the periods involved 

we are required to estimate the total consideration expected to be received from contracts with customers in some circumstances the consideration expected to be received is variable based on the specific terms of the contract or based on our expectations of the term of the contract generally we have not experienced significant returns or refunds to customers these estimates require significant judgment and the change in these estimates could have an effect on our results of operations during the periods involved 

business combinations 

when we acquire businesses we allocate the purchase price to the acquired tangible assets and assumed liabilities including deferred revenue liabilities associated with the fair value of contingent consideration and acquired identifiable intangible assets any residual purchase price is recorded as goodwill the allocation of the purchase price requires us to make significant estimates in determining the fair values of these acquired assets and assumed liabilities especially with respect to intangible assets and goodwill these estimates are based on information obtained from management of the acquired companies our assessment of this information and historical experience these estimates can include but are not limited to the cash flows that an acquired business is expected to generate in the future the cash flows that specific assets acquired with that business are expected to generate in the future the appropriate weightedaverage cost of capital and the cost savings expected to be derived from acquiring an asset these estimates are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and if different estimates were used the purchase price for the acquisition could be allocated to the acquired assets and assumed liabilities differently from the allocation that we have made to the acquired assets and assumed liabilities in addition unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that may affect the accuracy or validity of such estimates and if such events occur we may be required to adjust the value allocated to acquired assets or assumed liabilities 

we also make significant judgments and estimates when we assign useful lives to the definitelived intangible assets identified as part of our acquisitions these estimates are inherently uncertain and if we used different estimates the useful life over which we amortize intangible assets would be different in addition unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that may impact the useful life assigned to our intangible assets which would impact our amortization of intangible assets expense and our results of operations 

new accounting standards 

credit losses 

in june 2016 the fasb issued asu 201613 “measurement of credit losses on financial instruments” which supersedes current guidance requiring recognition of credit losses when it is probable that a loss has been incurred the new standard requires the establishment of an allowance for estimated credit losses on financial assets including trade and other receivables at each reporting date the new standard will result in earlier recognition of allowances for losses on trade and other receivables and other contractual rights to receive cash the new standard is effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 the adoption of this standard will not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements or the related disclosures 

goodwill impairment 

in january 2017 the fasb issued asu 201704 “simplifying the test for goodwill impairment” that eliminates “step 2” from the goodwill impairment test the new standard is effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 the new guidance must be applied on a prospective basis the adoption of this standard will not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements or the related disclosures 

fair value measurements 

in august 2018 the fasb issued asu 201813 “disclosure framework — changes to the disclosure requirements for fair value measurement” which modifies the disclosure requirements on fair value measurements the new standard is effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 the adoption of this standard will not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements or the related disclosures 

implementation costs incurred in a cloud computing arrangement 

in august 2018 the fasb issued asu 201815 “customer’s accounting for implementation costs incurred in a cloud computing arrangement that is a service contract” which clarifies the accounting for implementation costs in cloud computing arrangements the new standard aligns the treatment of implementation costs incurred by customers in cloud computing arrangements that are service contracts with the treatment of similar costs incurred to develop or obtain internaluse software under the new standard implementation costs are deferred and presented in the same line item as a prepayment of related arrangement fees the deferred costs are recognized over the term of the arrangement in the same line item as the related fees of the arrangement the new standard is effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 and will be applied prospectively to costs incurred after the date of adoption the adoption of this standard will not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements or the related disclosures 

accounting for income taxes 

in december 2019 the fasb issued asu 201912 “simplifying the accounting for income taxes” which simplifies the accounting for income taxes eliminates certain exceptions within asc 740 income taxes and clarifies certain aspects of the current guidance to promote consistency among reporting entities the new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2021 most amendments within the standard are required to be applied on a prospective basis while certain amendments must be applied on a retrospective or modified retrospective basis we are currently evaluating the impacts of the provisions of this standard on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

foreign currency risk 

a material portion of our revenue expenses and business activities are transacted in the us dollar in certain foreign countries where we price our products and services in us dollars a decrease in value of the local currency relative to the us dollar results in an increase in the prices for our products and services compared to those products of our competitors that are priced in local currency this could result in our prices being uncompetitive in certain markets 

in certain countries where we may invoice customers in the local currency our revenues benefit from a weaker dollar and are adversely affected by a stronger dollar the opposite impact occurs in countries where we record expenses in local currencies in those cases our costs and expenses benefit from a stronger dollar and are adversely affected by a weaker dollar the fluctuations in our operating expenses outside the united states resulting from volatility in foreign exchange rates are not generally moderated by corresponding fluctuations in revenues from existing contracts 

we enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to protect against currency exchange risks associated with existing assets and liabilities a foreign currency forward exchange contract acts as a hedge by increasing in value when underlying assets decrease in value or underlying liabilities increase in value due to changes in foreign exchange rates conversely a foreign currency forward exchange contract decreases in value when underlying assets increase in value or underlying liabilities decrease in value due to changes in foreign exchange rates these forward contracts are not designated as accounting hedges so the unrealized gains and losses are recognized in other income net in advance of the actual foreign currency cash flows with the fair value of these forward contracts being recorded as accrued liabilities or other current assets 

we do not use forward contracts for trading purposes our forward contracts generally have maturities of 90 days or less we enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts based on estimated future asset and liability exposures and the effectiveness of our hedging program depends on our ability to estimate these future asset and liability exposures recognized gains and losses with respect to our current hedging activities will ultimately depend on how accurately we are able to match the amount of foreign currency forward exchange contracts with actual underlying asset and liability exposures 

the following table provides information about our foreign currency forward exchange contracts as of december 28 2019  the information is provided in united states dollar equivalent amounts the table presents the notional amounts at contract exchange rates and the weighted average contractual foreign currency exchange rates expressed as units of the foreign currency per united states dollar which in some cases may not be the market convention for quoting a particular currency all of these forward contracts matured during february 2020  



we actively monitor our foreign currency risks but our foreign currency hedging activities may not substantially offset the impact of fluctuations in currency exchange rates on our results of operations cash flows and financial position 

interest rate risk 

our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our portfolio of cash and cash equivalents and balances outstanding on our revolving credit facility if any we are exposed to interest rate fluctuations in many of the world’s leading industrialized countries but our interest income and expense is most sensitive to fluctuations in the general level of united states interest rates in this regard changes in united states interest rates affect the interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents and the costs associated with foreign currency hedges 

all highly liquid securities with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase are considered to be cash equivalents the carrying value of our interestbearing instruments approximated fair value as of december 28 2019  

interest rates under our revolving credit facility are variable so interest expense could be adversely affected by changes in interest rates particularly for periods when we maintain a balance outstanding under the revolving credit facility interest rates for our revolving credit facility can fluctuate based on changes in market interest rates and in an interest rate margin that varies based on our consolidated leverage ratio as of december 28 2019  there were no borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility for an additional description of the revolving credit facility see note 3 in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

equity price risk 

equity investments 

we have a portfolio of equity investments that includes marketable equity securities and nonmarketable investments our equity investments are made primarily in connection with our strategic investment program under our strategic investment program from time to time we make cash investments in companies with technologies that are potentially strategically important to us see note 8 in the notes to consolidated financial statements for an additional description of these investments 




 item 9 changes in and disagreements with accountants on accounting and financial disclosure 

none 




 item 9a controls and procedures 

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

as required by rule 13a15 of the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended the “exchange act” under the supervision and with the participation of our management including our chief executive officer “ceo” and our chief financial officer “cfo” we evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rules 13a15e and 15d15e under the exchange act as of december 28 2019  

the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures included a review of our processes and the effect on the information generated for use in this annual report on form 10k in the course of this evaluation we sought to identify any material weaknesses in our disclosure controls and procedures to determine whether we had identified any acts of fraud involving personnel who have a significant role in our disclosure controls and procedures and to confirm that any necessary corrective action including process improvements was taken this type of evaluation is done every fiscal quarter so that our conclusions concerning the effectiveness of these controls can be reported in our periodic reports filed with the sec the overall goals of these evaluation activities are to monitor our disclosure controls and procedures and to make modifications as necessary we intend to maintain these disclosure controls and procedures modifying them as circumstances warrant 

based on their evaluation as of december 28 2019  our ceo and cfo have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by us in our reports filed or submitted under the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the sec’s rules and forms and is accumulated and communicated to our management including the ceo and cfo as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure 

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the fiscal quarter ended december 28 2019 that materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting 

inherent limitations on effectiveness of controls 

our management including our ceo and cfo does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud internal control over financial reporting no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of internal control are met further the design of internal control must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of the control must be considered relative to their costs while our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance of their effectiveness because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within cadence have been detected 

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rule 13a15f under the exchange act our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 28 2019  in making this assessment our management used the criteria established in internal controlintegrated framework 2013 issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission “coso” our management has concluded that as of december 28 2019  our internal control over financial reporting is effective based on these criteria our independent registered public accounting firm kpmg llp has issued an attestation report on our internal control over financial reporting which is included in part iv item 15 “exhibits and financial statement schedules”

overview 

we enable our customers to design electronic products our products and services are designed to give our customers a competitive edge in their development of electronic systems integrated circuits “ics” electronic devices and increasingly sophisticated manufactured products our products and services do this by optimizing performance minimizing power consumption shortening the time to bring our customers’ products to market and reducing their design development and manufacturing costs our customers create and sell electronic products at differing levels of completeness our electronic systems customers deliver entire devices such as smartphones laptop computers gaming systems automobiles and autonomous driving servers cloud datacenter infrastructure artificial intelligence “ai” systems aerospace and defense medical equipment and networking products these systems companies internally develop or externally purchase the subcomponents for their products including printed circuit boards “pcbs” which interconnect all the hardware components ics which are often referred to as computer chips and software at various levels which runs on the hardware our semiconductor customers deliver ics which include subcategories such as memory chips systemsonchip “socs” analog chips processors and other types of chips 

we offer software hardware services and reusable ic design blocks which are commonly referred to as intellectual property “ip” systems customers use our offerings to develop and integrate software that is key to the functionality of their products as well as to design their ics and pcbs our semiconductor customers use our offerings to design configure analyze and verify ics additionally some customers license our ip which accelerates their product development processes by providing predesigned and verified circuit blocks for their ics 

our strategy which we call system design enablement “sde” is to provide the technologies necessary for our customers to develop a complete and functional electronic product our sde strategy enables us to address the growing trends of electronic systems companies developing their own ics as part of their end product systems as well as semiconductor companies delivering greater portions of the systems into which their ic products are integrated the development of electronic products or their subcomponents is complex and requires many engineers using our solutions with specialized knowledge and skill the rate of technical innovation in electronics is swift long driven by a concept known as moore’s law which more than 50 years ago predicted that the complexity of ics would double about every 24 months in order to make our customers successful our products must handle this exponential growth rate in complexity without requiring a corresponding increase in our customers’ costs historically the industry that provided the tools used by ic engineers was referred to as electronic design automation “eda” today our offerings include and extend beyond eda tools to include sde 

our sde solutions facilitate the electronic product creation process at four levels first our core eda offerings enable engineers to complete tasks associated with the design analysis and verification of ics core eda tools and services are specifically designed to meet the requirements of engineers who develop different types of ics the second level of sde solutions is ip which consists of design ip and verification ip “vip” design ip is directly integrated into the ic by the customer as part of its development process vip consists of technologies and methodologies useful for verifying how design ip is integrated into the ic but vip does not become part of the ic product the third level of sde solutions is system interconnect and includes tools and services used for the design analysis and verification of pcbs as well as the packages that encapsulate the ics for electrical and physical connection to the pcb the fourth level of sde solutions is system integration which includes the engineering tasks associated with designing and analyzing systems verifying system functionality combining software with hardware or developing new software for an ic or system prior to its manufacture 

business drivers 

our products and services enable our customers to design complex and innovative electronic products so demand for our products is driven by our customers’ investment in new designs and products the most promising new opportunities for us involve enabling the design of electronic systems for machine learning edge computing hyperscale datacenter infrastructure 5g networks augmented reality virtual reality internetofthings aerospace and defense and autonomous vehicle subsystems large and existing electronics categories such as datacenter servers smartphones and networking products continue to provide business opportunities for us as customers initiate new design projects 

underlying the requirements within any particular vertical market sector is the availability of rapidly improving ic manufacturing technology in order for our customers to take advantage of such advancements certain of our products must first be developed to exploit these new manufacturing capabilities this dependency means that we must invest significantly in product research and development to keep pace with the latest manufacturing technology the demand for new ic manufacturing technology directly impacts the demand for our newest products 

another driver for our business is the differentiation capabilities and benefits provided to our customers by our products with the rapid pace of innovation comes the opportunity for our products to address key challenges associated with electronic product creation such as power consumption performance and cost our products have unique attributes that our customers value in general these attributes can be grouped into broader categories such as quality of results in terms of power consumption performance and chip area engineering productivity tool performance new capabilities or methods and faster timetomarket our business opportunities are significantly enhanced when our offerings address these key factors we are applying machine learning techniques within our products to enhance quality of results productivity performance and methodology 

products and product strategy 

our strategy is to provide our customers with the ability to address the broad range of issues that arise as they develop electronic products our sde solutions are comprised of products that are categorized according to the role they play in the electronic product design process we combine our products and technologies into categories related to major design activities the following table shows the relationship between our product categories and the sde levels to which they relate

product arrangements 

we primarily license our software using timebased licenses our timebased license arrangements offer customers the right to access and use all of the products delivered at the outset of an arrangement and updates throughout the entire term of the arrangement which is generally two to three years with no rights to return our updates provide for continued access to our evolving technology as our customers’ designs migrate to more advanced nodes in addition certain timebased license arrangements include 

 a small portion of our software is licensed under perpetual licenses which does not include the right to use new technology payment terms for timebased licenses generally provide for payments to be made over the license period and payment terms for perpetual licenses generally are net 30 days 

during fiscal 2018 we launched the cadence cloud portfolio the first broad cloud portfolio for the development of electronic systems and semiconductors the cadence cloud portfolio consists of our managed and customermanaged environments that enable electronic product developers to use the scalability of the cloud to securely manage the exponential increase in design complexity contractual arrangements with customers for both environments are timebased similar to the onpremise software license arrangements described above cadencemanaged environment arrangements include hardware resources accessible via cloud offerings provided by cadence customermanaged environment arrangements do not include cloud hardware offerings because customers arrange for their own cloud hardware and purchase a special license from cadence to enable cloud scalability of their onpremise software 

our emulation and prototyping hardware products are either sold or leased to our customers our emulation hardware can also be accessed remotely via a cadencemanaged cloud arrangement 

we generally license our design ip under nonexclusive license agreements that provide usage rights for specific designs in addition for certain of our ip license agreements we collect royalties as our customers ship their product that includes our ip to their customers 

for a further description of our license agreements our emulation and prototyping hardware sale or lease agreements revenue recognition policies and results of operations please refer to the discussion under “critical accounting estimates” under part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” 

technical support and maintenance 

customer service and support is critical to the adoption and successful use of our products we provide our customers with technical support and maintenance to facilitate their use of our software hardware and ip solutions 

services 

we offer a number of services including services related to methodology education and hosted design solutions these services may be sold separately or sold and performed in conjunction with the license sale or lease of our products as necessary certain of our design services engineers are assigned to internal research and development projects associated with our design ip business 

as part of our services offerings we design advanced ics develop custom ip and address industry design issues that may not be solved adequately by today’s eda technologies this enables us to target and accelerate the development of new software technology and products to satisfy current and future design requirements 

we offer engineering services to collaborate with our customers in the design of complex ics and the implementation of key design capabilities including low power design ic packaging and board design functional verification digital implementation analogmixedsignal design and systemlevel design the customers for these services primarily consist of semiconductor and systems companies developing products for the consumer communications military aerospace and computing markets these ics range from digital socs and analog and rf designs to complex mixedsignal ics 

in delivering methodology services we leverage our experience and knowledge of design techniques our products leading practices and different design environments to improve the productivity of our customers’ engineering teams depending on the customers’ projects and needs we work with customers using outsourcing consultative and collaborative offerings 

our education services offerings can be customized and include training programs that are conducted via the internet or in a classroom setting the content of these offerings ranges from the latest ic design techniques to methodologies for using the most recent features of our eda products the primary focus of education services is to accelerate our customers’ path to productivity in the use of our products 

thirdparty programs and initiatives 

in addition to our products many customers use design tools that are provided by other eda companies as well as design ip available from multiple suppliers we support the use of thirdparty design products and design ip through our connections ®  program and through our participation in industry groups such as the silicon integration initiative and accellera system initiative we actively contribute to the development and deployment of industry standards 

product and maintenance and services revenue 

revenue and revenue as a percentage of total revenue from our product and maintenance and services offerings for the last three fiscal years were as follows 



our revenue mix is such that approximately 90 of our revenue is recognized over time and the remainder of the revenue is recognized at a point in time typically upon delivery 

for an additional description of our product and maintenance and services revenue see the discussion under “results of operations” under part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” for our fiscal 2018  results of operations and our financial position as of december 29 2018  see part iv item 15 “exhibits and financial statement schedules” 

remaining performance obligations and backlog 

on the first day of fiscal 2018 we adopted accounting standards update “asu” 201409 “revenue from contracts with customers topic 606” which requires us to disclose revenue allocated to remaining performance obligations revenue allocated to remaining performance obligations represents the transaction price allocated to the performance obligations that are unsatisfied or partially unsatisfied as of december 29 2018  which includes deferred revenue and amounts that will be invoiced and recognized as revenue in future periods contracted but unsatisfied performance obligations were approximately 29 billion  as of december 29 2018  of which we expect to recognize approximately 60  as revenue over the next 12 months and the remainder thereafter 

revenue allocated to remaining performance obligations is different from our historical backlog in that it includes fully executed contracts with future effective dates and excludes committed contracts for which the deliverables are not fully defined whereas our historical backlog excluded fully executed contracts with future effective dates and included contracts for which the deliverables were not fully defined our standalone backlog was 27 billion  as of december 30 2017  

the substantial majority of our remaining performance obligations consists of customer contracts for which product and maintenance revenue is recognized over the contract life historically we have not experienced significant cancellations of our contracts with customers for engineering services contracts in backlog completion dates are occasionally rescheduled delaying revenue recognition under those contracts beyond the original anticipated completion date 

marketing and sales 

we generally market our products and provide services to existing and prospective customers through a direct sales force consisting of sales people and applications engineers applications engineers provide technical presales and postsales support for our products due to the complexity of many of our products and the system design process the sales cycle is generally long requiring three to six months or more during the sales cycle our direct sales force generally provides technical presentations product demonstrations and support for onsite customer evaluation of our solutions we also promote our products and services through advertising marketing automation trade shows public relations and the internet we selectively utilize valueadded resellers to broaden our reach and reduce cost of sales our orcad products and certain allegro products are primarily marketed through these channels with respect to international sales we generally market and support our products and services through our subsidiaries we also use a thirdparty distributor to license our products and services to certain customers in japan 

research and development 

our future performance depends on our ability to innovate commercialize newly developed solutions and enhance and maintain our current products the primary areas of our research and development align with our product categories discussed above we must continuously reengineer our products to solve new or increased physics challenges that arise with each successive process node and address the increase in complexity that is introduced by the resulting much larger designs we must also keep pace with our customers’ technical developments satisfy industry standards and meet our customers’ increasingly demanding performance productivity quality and predictability requirements therefore we expect to continue to invest in research and development 

hardware manufacturing and software distribution 

our emulation and prototyping hardware including all individual pcbs custom ics and fpgabased prototyping products is manufactured assembled and tested by subcontractors before delivery to our customers software and documentation are primarily distributed to customers by secure electronic delivery by way of the cloud or on dvd 

proprietary technology 

our success depends in part upon our proprietary technology we generally rely on patents copyrights trademarks and trade secret laws licenses and restrictive agreements to establish and protect our proprietary rights in technology and products many of our products include software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties we may have to seek new licenses or renew existing licenses for thirdparty software and other intellectual property in the future as part of performing engineering services for customers our engineering services business uses certain software and other intellectual property licensed from third parties including that of our competitors 

competition 

we compete most frequently with synopsys inc and mentor graphics corporation which was acquired by siemens ag in 2017 and with numerous other eda providers manufacturers of electronic devices that have developed acquired or have the capability to develop their own eda products electronics design and consulting companies and other ip companies these include altium limited ansys inc ceva inc keysight technologies inc and zuken ltd 

certain competitive factors in the engineering services business differ from those of the products businesses while we compete with other eda companies in the engineering services business our principal competitors include independent engineering service businesses many of these companies are also customers and therefore use our product offerings in the delivery of their services or products

 item 1a risk factors 

our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties including those described in the sections below that could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations cash flows and the trading price of our common stock 

risks related to our business 

any periods of uncertainty in the global economy and international trade relations and any potential downturn in the semiconductor and electronics industries may negatively impact our business and reduce our bookings levels and revenue 

purchases of our products and services are dependent upon the commencement of new design projects by ic manufacturers and electronics systems companies the ic and electronics systems industries are cyclical and are characterized by constant and rapid technological change rapid product obsolescence and price erosion evolving standards short product life cycles and wide fluctuations in product supply and demand 

the ic and electronics systems industries have also experienced significant downturns in connection with or in anticipation of maturing product cycles of both these industries’ and their customers’ products while spending on eda products and services has grown in recent years the current outlook for the semiconductor industry is uncertain and may result in a decrease in spending on eda products and services which are a part of our overall sde offering 

while we cannot predict global economic conditions uncertainty about future political and economic conditions adverse changes to international trade relationships between countries in which we do business or future decline in corporate or consumer spending could negatively impact our customers’ businesses reducing the number of new chip designs and their overall research and development spending including their spending on our products and services and as a result decrease demand for our products and services decreased bookings for our products and services customer bankruptcies consolidation among our customers or problems or delays with our hardware suppliers or with the supply or delivery of our hardware products could also adversely affect our ability to grow our business or adversely affect our future revenues and financial results our future business and financial results including demand for our products and services are subject to considerable uncertainty that could impact our stock price if economic conditions or international trade relationships between countries in which we do business deteriorate in the future or in particular if semiconductor or electronics systems industry revenues do not grow the ability to export or import products or services by the semiconductor or electronics systems industry is adversely restricted or our suppliers of our hardware components and products are subject to problems or delays our future revenues and financial results could be adversely affected even if economic conditions improve for our customers after a period of decline the positive impact on our revenues and financial results may be deferred due to cautious customer research and development spending and our mix of licenses that yield revenue recognized over time 

customer consolidation could affect our operating results 

there has been a trend toward customer consolidation in the semiconductor industry through business combinations including mergers asset acquisitions and strategic partnerships as this trend continues it could make us dependent on fewer customers who may be able to exert increased pressure on our prices and other contract terms and could increase the portion of our total sales concentration for any single customer customer consolidation activity could also reduce the demand for our products and services if such customers streamline research and development or operations reduce purchases or delay purchasing decisions these outcomes could negatively impact our operating results and financial condition 

our failure to respond quickly to technological developments or customers’ increasing technological requirements could make our products uncompetitive and obsolete 

the industries in which we compete experience rapid technology developments rapid changes in industry standards and customer requirements and frequent introductions and improvements of new products currently the industries we serve are experiencing the following trends 



 if we are unable to respond quickly and successfully to these trends we may lose our competitive position and our products or technologies may become obsolete to compete successfully we must develop acquire or license new products and improve our existing products and processes on a schedule that keeps pace with technological developments and the requirements for products addressing a broad spectrum of designers and designer expertise in our industries we must provide frequent and relevant updates to our software products in order to provide substantial benefit to the customer throughout the license periods because of the rapid changes in our customers’ industries the market must also accept our new and improved products our hardware platforms must be enhanced periodically to reduce the likelihood that a competitor surpasses the capabilities we offer our introduction of new products could reduce the demand and revenue of our older products or affect their pricing we must also be able to support a range of changing computer software hardware platforms and customer preferences a rapid transition by our customers to different business models associated with cloud computing technologies could result in reduced revenue we cannot guarantee that we will be successful in keeping pace with all or any of the customer trends 

competitive pressures may require us to reduce our pricing which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

the highly competitive markets in which we do business can put pressure on us to reduce the prices of our software emulation and prototyping hardware and ip if our competitors offer significant discounts on certain products in an effort to recapture or gain market share or to sell other software or hardware products we may then need to lower our prices or offer other favorable terms to compete successfully any such changes would be likely to reduce our profit margins and could adversely affect our operating results any substantial changes to our prices and pricing policies could cause revenues to decline or be delayed as our sales force implements and our customers adjust to the new pricing policies some of our competitors bundle products for promotional purposes or as a longterm pricing strategy or provide guarantees of prices and product implementations these practices could over time significantly constrain the prices that we can charge for our products if we cannot offset price reductions with a corresponding increase in the number of sales or with lower spending then the reduced revenues resulting from lower prices could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

our system design enablement strategy requires the development or acquisition of products and expertise in new areas of technology our inability to develop or acquire these capabilities could impede our ability to address the technical requirements in technology segments which are expected to contribute to our growth 

our sde strategy is meant to increase our business among electronic systems companies which are now designing their own ics sde is also meant to increase our business among semiconductor companies which are increasing their contribution to the end products into which their ics are incorporated part of this strategy involves addressing the needs of new categories of electronic systems including hyperscale computing and infrastructure edge computing machine learning augmented reality virtual reality internetofthings and autonomous vehicle subsystems where increased investment is expected by our customers each of these categories requires technologies and expertise that are applicationspecific if we are unable to develop or acquire the applicationspecific technologies and expertise necessary to address the requirements of these categories it could impede our ability to expand our business in these categories and ultimately affect our future growth 

we have experienced varied operating results and our operating results for any particular fiscal period are affected by the timing of revenue recognition particularly for our emulation and prototyping hardware and ip products 

various factors affect our operating results and some of them are not within our control our operating results for any period are affected by the mix of products and services sold in a given period and the timing of revenue recognition particularly for our emulation and prototyping hardware and ip products in addition we have recorded net losses in the past and may record net losses in the future also our cash flows from operating activities have and will continue to fluctuate due to a number of factors including the timing of our billings collections disbursements and tax payments 

a substantial portion of the product revenue related to our hardware business and our ip offerings is recognized upon delivery and our forecasted revenue results are based in part on our expectations of hardware and ip to be delivered in a particular quarter therefore changes in hardware and ip bookings or deliveries relative to expectations will have a more immediate impact on our revenue than changes in software or services bookings for which revenue is generally recognized over time 

in recent years we made significant investments to expand our ip offerings through among other things research and development and acquisitions as we continue to expand our ip offerings a portion of the revenue related to our ip bookings will be deferred until we complete and deliver the licensed ip to our customers as a result costs related to the research and development of the ip may be incurred prior to the recognition of the related revenue 

revenue related to our hardware and ip products is inherently difficult to predict because sales of our hardware and ip products depend on the commencement of new projects for the design and development of complex ics and systems by our customers our customers’ willingness to expend capital to deploy our new and existing hardware or ip products in those projects and the availability of our new and existing hardware or ip products for delivery therefore our hardware or ip sales may be delayed or may decrease if our customers delay or cancel projects because their spending is constrained or if there are problems or delays with the supply or delivery of our hardware or ip products or our hardware suppliers moreover the hardware and ip markets are highly competitive and our customers may choose to purchase a competitor’s hardware or ip product based on cost performance or other factors these factors may result in lower revenue which would have an adverse effect on our business results of operations or cash flows 

a substantial proportion of our software licenses yield revenue recognized over time which may make it difficult for us to rapidly increase our revenue in future fiscal periods 

we plan our operating expenses based on forecasted revenue expected business needs and other factors these expenses and the effect of longterm commitments are relatively fixed in the short term bookings and the related revenue are harder to forecast in a difficult economic environment if we experience a shortfall in bookings our operating results could differ from our expectations because we may not be able to quickly reduce our expenses in response to shortterm business changes 

the methods estimates and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies have a significant impact on our results of operations see “critical accounting estimates” under part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” such methods estimates and judgments are by their nature subject to substantial risks uncertainties and assumptions and factors may arise over time that may lead us to change our methods estimates and judgments changes in those methods estimates and judgments could significantly affect our results of operations 

historical results of operations should not be viewed as reliable indicators of our future performance if our revenue operating results or business outlook for future periods fall short of the levels expected by us securities analysts or investors the trading price of our common stock could decline 

we have invested and expect to continue to invest in research and development efforts for new and existing products and technologies and technical sales support such investments may affect our operating results and if the return on these investments is lower or develops more slowly than we expect our revenue and operating results may suffer 

we have invested and expect to continue to invest in research and development for new and existing products technologies and services in response to our customers’ increasing technological requirements such investments may be in related areas such as technical sales support these investments may involve significant time risks and uncertainties including the risk that the expenses associated with these investments may affect our margins and operating results and that such investments may not generate sufficient revenues to offset liabilities assumed and expenses associated with these new investments we believe that we must continue to invest a significant amount of time and resources in our research and development efforts and technical sales support to maintain and improve our competitive position if we do not achieve the benefits anticipated from these investments if the achievement of these benefits is delayed or if customers reduce or slow the need to upgrade or enhance their eda products and design flows our revenue and operating results may be adversely affected 

the competition in our industries is substantial and we may not be able to continue to successfully compete in our industries 

the industries in which we do business including software hardware ip and services for enabling the design of electronic products are highly competitive and require us to identify and develop or acquire innovative and costcompetitive products integrate them into platforms and market them in a timely manner we may not be able to compete successfully in these industries which could seriously harm our business operating results or financial condition factors that could affect our ability to compete successfully include 



we compete most frequently with synopsys inc and mentor graphics corporation which was acquired by siemens ag in 2017 and also with numerous other eda providers manufacturers of electronic devices that have developed acquired or have the capability to develop their own eda products electronics design and consulting companies and other ip companies these include altium limited ansys inc ceva inc keysight technologies inc and zuken ltd 

we have acquired and expect to acquire other companies and businesses and may not realize the expected benefits of these acquisitions 

we have acquired and expect to acquire other companies and businesses in order to expand our product offerings our future revenue growth and expansion of our business is dependent on our successful integration of our acquisitions we may incur significant costs in connection with potential transactions including acquisitions that are not consummated potential and completed acquisitions involve a number of risks if any of the following acquisitionrelated risks occur our business operating results or financial condition could be adversely impacted 

 in a number of our completed acquisitions we have agreed to make future payments either in the form of employee retention bonuses or contingent purchase price payments based on the achievement of specified milestones the performance goals pursuant to which these future payments may be made generally relate to the achievement by the acquired company or business or by the employees who joined us with the acquired company or business of certain specified bookings revenue run rate product proliferation product development or employee retention goals during a specified period following completion of the applicable acquisition the specific performance goal levels and amounts and timing of employee bonuses or contingent purchase price payments vary with each acquisition we may continue to use contingent payments in connection with acquisitions in the future and while we expect to derive value from an acquisition in excess of such contingent payment obligations we may be required to make certain contingent payments without deriving the anticipated value 

future acquisitions may involve issuances of stock as full or partial payment of the purchase price for the acquired company or business grants of restricted stock restricted stock units or stock options to employees of the acquired companies or businesses which may be dilutive to existing stockholders expenditure of substantial cash resources or the incurrence of a material amount of debt these arrangements may impact our liquidity financial position and results of operations or increase dilution of our stockholders’ equity interests in the company 

we make and expect to make strategic investments and may not realize the expected benefits of these investments 

we have made and expect to make strategic investments in which we have a minority equity interest and do not have operational control these strategic investments may also involve collaboration agreements that further and complement our strategy and marketing efforts we may not be able to realize the expected benefits of these investments and the related collaborations may be difficult to manage without sole decisionmaking authority and the economic or business interests in these collaborations may become inconsistent with our interests these challenges could have an adverse effect on our business operating results or financial condition 

the accounting applied to strategic investments depends on a number of factors including but not limited to our percentage of ownership and the level of our influence over the entity losses experienced by these strategic investment entities or associated impairment charges could adversely impact our operating results and the value of our investment in addition if these entities fail and cease operations we may lose the value of our investment and shared profits 

failure to obtain export licenses or restrictions on trade imposed by the united states or other countries could harm our business by rendering us unable to sell or ship products and transfer our technology outside of the united states 

we must comply with regulations of the united states and of certain other countries in selling or shipping our products and transferring our technology outside the united states and to foreign nationals changes in these regulations or restrictions due to changes in trade relationships with the united states including new tariffs trade protection measures import or export licensing requirements sanctions trade embargoes and other trade barriers could harm our business operating results or financial condition 

the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations may adversely impact our revenue expenses cash flows and financial condition 

we have significant operations outside the united states our revenue from international operations as a percentage of total revenue was approximately 57  during fiscal 2018 58  during fiscal 2017 and 54  during fiscal 2016 we expect that revenue from our international operations will continue to account for a significant portion of our total revenue we also transact business in various foreign currencies although the majority of our revenue contracts worldwide are denominated in us dollars volatility of currencies in countries where we conduct business most notably the us dollar chinese renminbi japanese yen european union euro british pound and indian rupee have had and may in the future have an effect on our revenue or operating results 

fluctuations in the rate of exchange between the us dollar and the currencies of other countries where we conduct business could seriously affect our business operating results or financial condition for example when a foreign currency declines in value relative to the us dollar it takes more of the foreign currency to purchase the same amount of us dollars than before the change if we price our products and services in the foreign currency we receive fewer us dollars than we did before the change if we price our products and services in us dollars the decrease in value of the local currency results in an increase in the price for our products and services compared to those products of our competitors that are priced in local currency this could result in our prices being uncompetitive in markets where business is transacted in the local currency on the other hand when a foreign currency increases in value relative to the us dollar it takes more us dollars to purchase the same amount of the foreign currency as we use the foreign currency to fund payroll costs and other operating expenses in our international operations this results in an increase in operating expenses approximately 30 of our total costs and expenses are transacted in foreign currencies our attempts to reduce the effect of foreign currency fluctuations may be unsuccessful and significant exchange rate movements may adversely impact our results of operations as expressed in us dollars 

our operating results could be adversely affected by an increase in our effective tax rate as a result of us and foreign tax law changes outcomes of current or future tax examinations or by material differences between our forecasted and actual effective tax rates 

our operations are subject to income and transaction taxes in the united states and in multiple foreign jurisdictions with a significant amount of our foreign earnings generated by our subsidiaries organized in ireland and hungary any significant change in our future effective tax rates could adversely impact our results of operations for future periods our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by the following 

 the irs and other tax authorities regularly examine our income tax returns and other nonincome tax returns such as payroll sales use valueadded net worth or franchise property goods and services consumption import stamp and excise taxes in both the united states and foreign jurisdictions the calculation of our provision for income taxes and our accruals for other taxes requires us to use significant judgment and involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes we regularly assess the potential settlement outcomes resulting from income tax examinations however the final outcome of tax examinations including the total amount payable or the timing of any such payments upon resolution of these issues cannot be estimated with certainty in addition we cannot be certain that such amount will not be materially different from the amount that is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals for other taxes should the irs or other tax authorities assess additional taxes penalties or interest as a result of a current or a future examination we may be required to record charges to operations in future periods that could have a material impact on our results of operations financial position or cash flows in the applicable period or periods 

forecasts of our annual effective tax rate are complex and subject to uncertainty because our income tax position for each year combines the effects of estimating our annual income or loss the mix of profits and losses earned by us and our subsidiaries in tax jurisdictions with a broad range of income tax rates as well as benefits from available deferred tax assets the impact of various accounting rules our interpretations of changes in tax laws and results of tax audits forecasts of our annual effective tax rate do not include the anticipation of future tax law changes in addition we account for certain tax benefits from stockbased compensation in the period the stock compensation vests or is settled which may cause increased variability in our quarterly effective tax rates if there were a material difference between forecasted and actual tax rates it could have a material impact on our results of operations 

tax laws regulations and compliance practices are evolving and may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flows and financial position 

the us tax cuts and jobs act the “tax act” was enacted in december 2017 and significantly affected us tax law by changing how the us imposes income tax on multinational corporations the us department of treasury has broad authority to issue regulations and interpretative guidance that may significantly impact how we will apply the law and impact our results of operations as additional interpretative guidance is issued by the applicable authorities we may need to revise our provision benefit for income taxes in future periods these revisions could materially affect our results of operations cash flow and financial position for further discussion regarding our income taxes please refer to part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” under the heading “income taxes” and note 6 in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

 tax laws regulations and administrative practices in various jurisdictions are evolving and may be subject to significant changes due to economic political and other conditions there are many transactions that occur during the ordinary course of business for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain and significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our provision and accruals for these taxes governments are increasingly focused on ways to increase tax revenues particularly from multinational corporations which may lead to an increase in audit activity and harsher positions taken by tax authorities we are currently subject to tax audits in various jurisdictions and these jurisdictions may assess additional tax liabilities against us 

the organisation for economic cooperation and development “oecd” an international association of 36 countries including the united states released the final reports from its base erosion and profit shifting “beps” action plans which aim to standardize and modernize global tax policies the beps action plans propose revisions to numerous tax rules including countrybycountry reporting permanent establishment hybrid entities and instruments transfer pricing and tax treaties the beps action plans have been or are being enacted by countries where we have operations the european commission “ec” has conducted investigations in multiple countries focusing on whether local country tax rulings provide preferential tax treatment that violates european union state aid rules and concluded that certain countries including ireland have provided illegal state aid in certain cases the ec and oecd have also been evaluating new rules on the taxation of the digital economy companies in addition taiwan italy the united kingdom france india and hungary have recently introduced new rulings or proposals to tax digital transactions these developments in tax laws and regulations and compliance with these rules could have a material adverse effect on our operating results financial position and cash flows 

our stock price has been subject to fluctuations and may continue to be subject to fluctuations 

the market price of our common stock has experienced fluctuations and may fluctuate or decline in the future and as a result you could lose the value of your investment the market price of our common stock may be affected by a number of factors including 

 in addition equity markets in general and the equities of technology companies in particular have experienced and may experience in the future extreme price and volume fluctuations due to among other factors the actions of market participants or other actions outside of our control such price and volume fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock for reasons unrelated to our business or operating results 

our future revenue is dependent in part upon our installed customer base continuing to license or buy products and purchase services 

our installed customer base has traditionally generated additional new license service and maintenance revenues in future periods customers may not necessarily license or buy additional products or contract for additional services or maintenance our customers many of which are large semiconductor and systems companies often have significant bargaining power in negotiations with us customer consolidation can reduce the total level of purchases of our software hardware ip and services and in some cases increase customers’ bargaining power in negotiations with their suppliers including us 

we could suffer serious harm to our business because of the infringement of our intellectual property rights by third parties or because of our infringement of the intellectual property rights of third parties 

there are numerous patents relating to our business and ecosystem new patents are being issued at a rapid rate and are owned by eda companies as well as entities and individuals outside the eda industry including parties whose income is primarily derived from infringementrelated licensing and litigation it is not always practicable to determine in advance whether a product or any of its components infringes the patent rights of others as a result from time to time we may be compelled to respond to or prosecute intellectual property infringement claims to protect our rights or defend a customer’s rights 

intellectual property infringement claims including contractual defense reimbursement obligations related to thirdparty claims against our customers regardless of merit could consume valuable management time result in costly litigation or cause product shipment delays all of which could seriously harm our business operating results or financial condition the risk of infringement and related indemnification claims associated with design ip products that are incorporated into a customer product broadly used by consumers may be higher than the risk associated with our software products in settling these claims we may be required to enter into royalty or licensing agreements with the third parties claiming infringement these royalty or licensing agreements if available may not have terms favorable to us being compelled to enter into a license agreement with unfavorable terms could seriously harm our business operating results or financial condition 

any potential intellectual property litigation could compel us to do one or more of the following 

 if we were compelled to take any of these actions our business or operating results may suffer 

if our security measures are breached and an unauthorized party obtains access to customer data financial data or assets or our proprietary business information our information systems may be perceived as being unsecure and our business and reputation could be harmed 

our products and services involve storage including cloudbased storage and transmission of our proprietary information and that of our customers we have offices throughout the world including key research and development facilities outside of the united states our operations are dependent upon the connectivity of our operations throughout the world despite our security measures our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to cyber attacks by unauthorized third parties which may include nationstates and individuals sponsored by them or breaches due to employee error malfeasance or other disruptions which could result in unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information and could significantly interfere with our business operations third parties may attempt to gain unauthorized access through a variety of methods such as the use of viruses malware ransomware phishing denial of service attacks and other cyber attacks and corrupt the processes of the products and services that we provide we may also be a target of malicious attacks in an attempt to gain access to our network including our cadence cloud portfolio which includes both our managed and customermanaged environments or data centers or those of our customers or end users steal proprietary information related to our business products services or infrastructure steal financial data or assets or interrupt our systems and services or those of our customers or others breaches of our security measures could expose us to a risk of loss or misuse of this information loss of financial assets litigation and potential liability because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage information systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventive measures in addition if we select a vendor that uses cloud storage of information as part of their service or product offerings or are selected as a vendor for our cadence cloud portfolio despite our attempts to validate the security of such services our proprietary information may be misappropriated by third parties in the event of an actual or perceived breach of our security or the security of one of our vendors the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed legal or regulatory actions could be initiated against us and we could suffer damage to our reputation or our business or lose existing customers and our ability to obtain new customers or suffer harm to our financial condition 

risks associated with our international operations could adversely impact our financial condition 

a significant amount of our revenue is derived from our international operations and we have offices throughout the world including key research and development facilities outside of the united states our international operations may be subject to a number of risks including 



 some of our international research and development and other facilities are in parts of the world where there may be a greater risk of business interruption as a result of political instability terrorist acts or military conflicts than businesses located domestically furthermore this potential harm is exacerbated because damage to or disruptions at our international research and development facilities could have a more significant adverse effect on our ability to develop new or improve existing products than other businesses that may only have sales offices or other less critical operations abroad we are not insured for losses or interruptions caused by acts of war furthermore our operations are dependent upon the connectivity of our operations throughout the world activities that interfere with our international connectivity or operations such as cyber hacking the introduction of a virus into our computer systems natural disasters civil unrest or terrorism could significantly interfere with our business operations 

in addition internal controls policies and procedures and employee training and compliance programs that we have implemented to deter prohibited practices may not prevent our employees contractors or agents from violating or circumventing our policies and the laws and regulations applicable to our worldwide operations 

we depend upon our management team and key employees and our failure to attract train motivate and retain management and key employees may make us less competitive and therefore harm our results of operations 

our business depends upon the continued services efforts and abilities of our senior management and other key employees competition for highly skilled executive officers and employees can be intense particularly in geographic areas recognized as high technology centers such as the silicon valley area where our principal offices are located and in other locations where we maintain facilities in addition competition for qualified personnel including software engineers in the eda commercial electronics engineering services and ip industries has intensified further increased uncertainty regarding social political and immigration policies in the united states and abroad may make it difficult to recruit employees with adequate experience we may also experience increased compensation costs that are not offset by either improved productivity or higher sales we may not be successful in recruiting new personnel and in retaining and motivating existing personnel from time to time there may be changes in our management team resulting from the hiring and departure of executive officers and as a result we may experience disruption to our business that may harm our operating results and our relationships with our employees customers and suppliers may be adversely affected 

to attract retain and motivate individuals with the requisite expertise we may be required to grant large numbers of stock options or other stockbased incentive awards which may be dilutive to existing stockholders and increase compensation expense and pay significant base salaries and cash bonuses which could harm our operating results the high cost of training new employees not fully utilizing these employees or losing trained employees to competing employers could also reduce our operating margins and harm our business or operating results 

in addition applicable rules and regulations require stockholder approval for new equity compensation plans and significant amendments to existing equity compensation plans including increases in shares available for issuance under such plans these rules and regulations could make it more difficult for us to grant equity compensation to employees in the future to the extent that these regulations make it more difficult or expensive to grant equity compensation to employees we may incur increased compensation costs or find it difficult to attract retain and motivate employees which could materially and adversely affect our business 

we rely on our proprietary technology as well as software and other intellectual property rights licensed to us by third parties and we cannot assure you that the precautions taken to protect our rights will be adequate or that we will continue to be able to adequately secure such intellectual property rights from third parties 

our success depends in part upon our proprietary technology we generally rely on patents copyrights trademarks trade secrets licenses and restrictive agreements to establish and protect our proprietary rights in technology and products despite the precautions we may take to protect our intellectual property third parties have tried in the past and may try in the future to challenge invalidate or circumvent these safeguards our patents and other intellectual property rights may not provide us with sufficient competitive advantages patents may not be issued on any of our pending applications and our issued patents may not be sufficiently broad to protect our technology furthermore the laws of foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights in those countries to the same extent as applicable law protects these rights in the united states the protection of our intellectual property may require the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources moreover the steps we take to protect our intellectual property may not adequately protect our rights or deter or prevent third parties from infringing or misappropriating our proprietary rights 

many of our products include software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties we may have to seek new or renew existing licenses for such software and other intellectual property in the future our engineering services business holds licenses to certain software and other intellectual property owned by third parties including that of our competitors our failure to obtain software other intellectual property licenses or other intellectual property rights that are necessary or helpful for our business on favorable terms or our need to engage in litigation over these licenses or rights could seriously harm our business operating results or financial condition 

we have substantial cash requirements in the united states but a significant portion of our cash is held and generated outside of the united states and if our cash available in the united states and the cash available under our revolving credit facility are insufficient to meet our operating expenses and debt repayment obligations in the united states then we may be required to raise cash in ways that could negatively affect our financial condition results of operations and the market price of our common stock 

we have significant operations outside the united states as of december 29 2018  approximately 75  of our cash and cash equivalents balance was held by subsidiaries outside the united states with the remainder of the balance held by us or our subsidiaries in the united states we believe that the combination of our us cash cash equivalents future us operating cash flows cash available under our revolving credit facility and other cash that may be accessible to us on attractive terms are sufficient to meet our ongoing us operating expenses and debt repayment obligations although the tax act may have reduced the tax impact of repatriation of foreign earnings there are still administrative processes associated with repatriation of foreign earnings that could affect the timing of returning cash to the us from nonus jurisdictions accordingly if our us cash were insufficient to meet our future funding obligations in the united states we could be required to seek funding sources on less attractive terms which could negatively impact our results of operations financial position and the market price of our common stock 

litigation could adversely affect our financial condition or operations 

we currently are and in the future may be involved in various disputes and litigation that arise in the ordinary course of business these include disputes and lawsuits related to intellectual property including customer indemnification mergers and acquisitions licensing contracts distribution arrangements and employee relations matters for information regarding the litigation matters in which we are currently engaged please refer to the discussion under part i item 3 “legal proceedings” and note 17 in the notes to consolidated financial statements we cannot provide any assurances that the final outcome of these lawsuits or any other proceedings that may arise in the future will not have a material adverse effect on our business reputation operating results financial condition or cash flows litigation can be time consuming and expensive and could divert management’s time and attention from our business which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and operating results 

errors or defects in our products and services could expose us to liability and harm our business 

our customers use our products and services in designing and developing products that involve a high degree of technological complexity each of which has its own specifications because of the complexity of the systems and products with which we work some of our products and designs can be adequately tested only when put to full use in the marketplace as a result our customers or their end users may discover errors or defects in our software or the systems we design or the products or systems incorporating our design and intellectual property may not operate as expected errors or defects could result in 

 our operating results and revenue could be adversely affected by customer payment delays customer bankruptcies and defaults or modifications of licenses 

occasionally our customers file for bankruptcy or face other challenging financial or operating conditions if our customers experience adversity in their business they may delay or default on their payment obligations to us request to modify contract terms or modify or cancel plans to license our products for instance if our customers are not successful in generating sufficient cash or are precluded from securing financing they may not be able to pay or may delay payment of accounts receivable that are owed to us although these obligations are generally not cancelable our customers’ inability to fulfill payment obligations in turn may adversely affect our revenue operating expenses and cash flow additionally our customers have in the past sought and may in the future seek to renegotiate preexisting contractual commitments payment defaults by our customers or significant reductions in existing contractual commitments could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results 

the long sales cycle of our products and services may cause our operating results to fluctuate unexpectedly 

generally we have a long sales cycle that can extend up to six months or longer the complexity and expense associated with our products and services generally require a lengthy customer education evaluation and approval process consequently we may incur substantial expenses and devote significant management effort and expense to develop potential relationships that do not result in agreements or revenue and may prevent us from pursuing other opportunities 

in addition sales of our products and services have been and may in the future be delayed if customers delay approval or commencement of projects because of 

 long sales cycles for hardware products subject us to a number of significant risks over which we have limited control including insufficient excess or obsolete inventory variations in inventory valuation and fluctuations in quarterly operating results 

our reported financial results may be adversely affected by changes in united states generally accepted accounting principles and we may incur significant costs to adjust our accounting systems and processes to comply with significant changes 

united states generally accepted accounting principles “us gaap” are subject to interpretation by the financial accounting standards board “fasb” the sec and various bodies formed to promulgate and interpret appropriate accounting principles we are also subject to evolving rules and regulations of the countries in which we do business changes to accounting standards or interpretations thereof may result in different accounting principles under us gaap that could have a significant effect on our reported financial results 

in addition we have in the past and may in the future need to significantly change our customer contracts accounting systems and processes when we adopt future or proposed changes in accounting principles the cost and effect of these changes may negatively impact our results of operations during the periods of transition 

our restructuring plans incur substantial costs and may not result in the benefits we have anticipated possibly having a negative effect on our future operating results 

in recent fiscal years we have initiated restructuring plans in an effort to reallocate or decrease costs by reducing our workforce and by consolidating facilities we incur substantial costs to implement restructuring plans and our restructuring activities may subject us to reputational risks and litigation risks and expenses our past restructuring plans do not provide any assurance that we will realize anticipated cost savings and other benefits or that additional restructuring plans will not be required or implemented in the future in addition our restructuring plans may have other consequences such as attrition beyond our planned reduction in workforce a negative effect on employee morale and productivity or our ability to attract highly skilled employees our competitors may also use our restructuring plans to seek to gain a competitive advantage over us as a result our restructuring plans may affect our revenue and other operating results in the future 

we depend on sole suppliers for certain hardware components and contract manufacturers for production of our emulation and prototyping hardware products making us vulnerable to supply disruption and price fluctuation 

we depend on sole suppliers for certain hardware components and contract manufacturers for production of our emulation and prototyping hardware products our reliance on sole suppliers and contract manufacturers could result in product delivery problems and delays and reduced control over product pricing and quality though we prefer to have multiple sources to procure certain key components in some cases it is not practical or feasible to do so we may suffer a disruption in the supply of certain hardware components if we are unable to purchase sufficient components on a timely basis or at all for any reason any supply or manufacturing disruption including delay in delivery of components by our suppliers or products by our manufacturers or the bankruptcy or shutdown of our suppliers or manufacturers could delay our production process and prevent us from delivering completed hardware products to customers or from supplying new evaluation units to customers which could have a negative impact on our revenue and operating results 

if we become subject to unfair hiring claims we could be prevented from hiring needed employees incur liability for damages and incur substantial costs in defending ourselves 

when companies in our industry lose employees to competitors they frequently claim that these competitors have engaged in unfair hiring practices or that the employment of these persons would involve the disclosure or use of trade secrets these claims could prevent us from hiring employees or cause us to incur liability for damages we could also incur substantial costs in defending ourselves or our employees against these claims regardless of their merits defending ourselves from these claims could also divert the attention of our management away from our operations 

antitakeover defenses in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and certain provisions under delaware law could prevent an acquisition of our company or limit the price that investors might be willing to pay for our common stock 

our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and certain provisions of the delaware general corporation law that apply to us could make it difficult for another company to acquire control of our company for example 

 all or any one of these factors could limit the price that certain investors would be willing to pay for shares of our common stock and could allow our board of directors to resist delay or prevent an acquisition of our company even if a proposed transaction were favored by a majority of our independent stockholders 

the investment of our cash is subject to risks that may cause losses and affect the liquidity of these investments 

our marketable investments include various money market funds and may include other investments as well weakened financial markets have at times adversely impacted the general credit liquidity market prices and interest rates for these and other types of investments additionally changes in monetary policy by the federal open market committee or other relevant regulators and concerns about the rising us government debt level may cause a decrease in the purchasing power of the us dollar and adversely affect our investment portfolio the financial market and monetary risks associated with our investment portfolio may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition liquidity results of operations or cash flows 

we are subject to evolving corporate governance and public disclosure expectations and regulations that impact compliance costs and risks of noncompliance 

we are subject to changing rules and regulations promulgated by a number of governmental and selfregulatory organizations including the sec nasdaq and the fasb as well as evolving investor expectations around corporate governance executive compensation and environmental and social practices and disclosures these rules and regulations continue to evolve in scope and complexity and many new requirements have been created in response to laws enacted by the us and foreign governments making compliance more difficult and uncertain the increase in costs to comply with such evolving expectations rules and regulations as well as any risk of noncompliance could adversely impact us 

conflict minerals regulations may cause us to continue to incur additional expenses and may adversely impact our ability to conduct our business 

in august 2012 the sec adopted new rules establishing disclosure and reporting requirements regarding the use of certain minerals referred to as “conflict minerals” in products these rules require us to determine disclose and report whether or not such minerals in our products originate from the democratic republic of the congo or adjoining countries we have incurred and expect to continue to incur costs to comply with these rules including costs associated with conducting due diligence on our supply chain and fulfilling our reporting requirements and we may incur costs related to changes to our products processes or sources of supply in addition these rules could affect the availability of certain minerals used in the manufacture of our emulation and prototyping hardware products and ip boards the “covered products” and thus impact our ability to source at competitive prices certain materials that are used in the covered products finally our customers may prefer to purchase products from vendors who claim that all minerals in their products are conflictfree and our revenues may be harmed or we may face reputational challenges if we are unable to verify that our covered products are conflictfree 

our business is subject to the risk of earthquakes and other natural disasters 

our corporate headquarters including certain of our research and development operations and certain of our distribution facilities is located in the silicon valley area of northern california a region known to experience seismic activity if significant seismic activity were to occur our operations may be interrupted which could adversely impact our business and results of operations 

our other offices in the united states and in other countries around the world may be adversely impacted by natural disasters if a natural disaster occurs at or near any of our offices our operations may be interrupted which could adversely impact our business and results of operations if a natural disaster impacts a significant number of our customers our business and results of operations could be adversely impacted 

risks related to our securities and indebtedness 

our debt obligations expose us to risks that could adversely affect our business operating results or financial condition and could prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under such indebtedness 

as of december 29 2018  we had total outstanding indebtedness of 4453 million  we also had the ability to borrow an additional 2500 million  under our revolving credit facility with the right to request increased capacity up to an additional 2500 million  upon the receipt of lender commitments for total maximum borrowings of 6000 million  under our revolving credit facility subject to the limits contained in the credit agreement governing our revolving credit facility the indenture that governs the 4375 senior notes due 2024 the “2024 notes” and our other debt instruments we may be able to incur substantial additional debt from time to time to finance working capital capital expenditures investments or acquisitions share repurchases or for other purposes if we do so the risks related to our high level of debt could intensify specifically our high level of debt could have important consequences including the following 

 acquisitions or other general corporate requirements 

 purposes thereby reducing the amount of cash flows available for working capital capital expenditures 

acquisitions and other general corporate purposes 

 our revolving credit facility are at variable rates of interest 

 at the option of the holders of our outstanding notes we may under certain circumstances be required to repurchase such notes 

under the terms of our 2024 notes we may be required to repurchase for cash such notes prior to their maturity in connection with the occurrence of certain significant corporate events specifically we are required to offer to repurchase such notes upon a “change of control triggering event” as defined in the indenture related to such notes such as a change of control accompanied by certain downgrades in the credit ratings of such notes the repayment obligations under such notes may have the effect of discouraging delaying or preventing a takeover of our company if we were required to pay the 2024 notes prior to their scheduled maturity it could have a significant negative impact on our cash and liquidity and could impact our ability to invest financial resources in other strategic initiatives 

the terms of the agreement governing our revolving credit facility and the indenture governing our 2024 notes restrict our current and future operations particularly our ability to respond to changes or to take certain actions 

the agreement governing our revolving credit facility contains a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and may limit our ability to engage in acts that may be in our longterm best interest including restrictions on our ability to 

 in addition the restrictive covenants in the agreement governing our revolving credit facility require us to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy other financial condition tests our ability to meet those financial ratios and tests can be affected by events beyond our control and we may be unable to meet them 

a breach of the covenants or restrictions under the agreement governing our revolving credit facility could result in an event of default under the applicable indebtedness such a default may allow the creditors to accelerate the related debt and may result in the acceleration of any other debt to which a crossacceleration or crossdefault provision applies in addition an event of default under the credit agreement governing our revolving credit facility would permit the lenders under our revolving credit facility to terminate all commitments to extend further credit under that facility in the event our lenders or note holders accelerate the repayment of our borrowings we and our subsidiaries may not have sufficient assets to repay that indebtedness as a result of these restrictions we may be 

 the indenture governing our 2024 notes also contains certain restrictive covenants that impose operating and financial restrictions on us and may limit our ability to engage in acts that may be in our longterm best interest including restrictions on our ability to incur liens and to enter into sale and leaseback transactions 

these restrictions may affect our ability to grow in accordance with our strategy in addition our financial results our substantial indebtedness and our credit ratings could adversely affect the availability and terms of our financing 

we may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness which may not be successful 

our ability to make scheduled payments on or refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial condition and operating performance which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial business legislative regulatory and other factors beyond our control we may be unable to maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal premium if any and interest on our indebtedness 

if our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations we could face substantial liquidity problems and could be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures or to dispose of material assets or operations seek additional debt or equity capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness we may not be able to effect any such alternative measures if necessary on commercially reasonable terms or at all and even if successful those alternative actions may not allow us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations the agreement governing our revolving credit facility restricts our ability to dispose of assets and use the proceeds from those dispositions and may also restrict our ability to raise debt or equity capital to be used to repay other indebtedness when it becomes due we may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain proceeds in an amount sufficient to meet any debt service obligations then due 

in addition we conduct a substantial portion of our operations through our subsidiaries none of which are currently guarantors of our indebtedness accordingly repayment of our indebtedness is dependent on the generation of cash flow by our subsidiaries and their ability to make such cash available to us by dividend debt repayment or otherwise unless they become guarantors of our indebtedness our subsidiaries do not have any obligation to pay amounts due on our indebtedness or to make funds available for that purpose our subsidiaries may not be able to or may not be permitted to make distributions to enable us to make payments in respect of our indebtedness each subsidiary is a distinct legal entity and under certain circumstances legal and contractual restrictions may limit our ability to obtain cash from our subsidiaries while the agreement governing our revolving credit facility limits the ability of our subsidiaries to incur consensual restrictions on their ability to pay dividends or make other intercompany payments to us these limitations are subject to qualifications and exceptions in the event that we do not receive distributions from our subsidiaries we may be unable to make required principal and interest payments on our indebtedness 

our inability to generate sufficient cash flows to satisfy our debt obligations or to refinance our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all would materially and adversely affect our financial position and results of operations and our ability to satisfy our debt obligations 

if we cannot make scheduled payments on our debt we will be in default and holders of our debt could declare all outstanding principal and interest to be due and payable the lenders under our revolving credit facility could terminate their commitments to loan money and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation in addition a material default on our indebtedness could suspend our eligibility to register securities using certain registration statement forms under sec guidelines that permit incorporation by reference of substantial information regarding us potentially hindering our ability to raise capital through the issuance of our securities and increasing our costs of registration 

despite our current level of indebtedness we and our subsidiaries may incur substantially more debt this could further exacerbate the risks to our financial condition described above 

we and our subsidiaries may incur significant additional indebtedness in the future although the agreement governing our revolving credit facility contains restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions and the additional indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial if we incur any additional indebtedness that ranks equally with the 2024 notes then subject to any collateral arrangements we may enter into the holders of that debt will be entitled to share ratably in any proceeds distributed in connection with any insolvency liquidation reorganization dissolution or other winding up of our company 

our variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly 

borrowings under our revolving credit facility are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk if interest rates were to increase our debt service obligations on our variable rate indebtedness would increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same and our net income and cash flows including cash available for servicing our indebtedness would correspondingly decrease assuming all loans were fully drawn we were to fully exercise our right to increase borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility each quarter point change in interest rates would result in a 15 million  change in annual interest expense on our indebtedness under our revolving credit facility in the future we may enter into interest rate swaps that involve the exchange of floating for fixed rate interest payments in order to reduce interest rate volatility however we may not maintain interest rate swaps with respect to all of our variable rate indebtedness and any swaps we enter into may not fully mitigate our interest rate risk 

various factors could increase our future borrowing costs or reduce our access to capital including a lowering or withdrawal of the ratings assigned to our 2024 notes by credit rating agencies 

we may in the future seek additional financing for a variety of reasons and our future borrowing costs and access to capital could be affected by factors including the condition of the debt and equity markets the condition of the economy generally prevailing interest rates our level of indebtedness and our business and financial condition in addition the 2024 notes currently have an investment grade credit rating and any credit rating assigned could be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a credit rating agency if in that credit rating agency’s judgment future circumstances relating to the basis of the credit rating such as adverse changes so warrant consequently real or anticipated changes in our credit ratings will generally affect the market value of the 2024 notes any future lowering of the credit ratings of the 2024 notes likely would make it more difficult or more expensive for us to obtain additional debt financing

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

  

the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k and with part i item 1a “risk factors” please refer to the cautionary language at the beginning of part i of this annual report on form 10k regarding forwardlooking statements 

business overview 

we enable our customers to design electronic products our products and services are designed to give our customers a competitive edge in their development of electronic systems ics electronic devices and increasingly sophisticated manufactured products our products and services do this by optimizing performance minimizing power consumption shortening the time to bring our customers’ products to market and reducing their design development and manufacturing costs we offer software hardware services and reusable ic design blocks which are commonly referred to as ip 

our strategy which we call sde is to provide the technologies necessary for our customers to develop a complete and functional electronic product our sde strategy enables us to address the growing trends of electronic systems companies developing their own ics as part of their end product systems as well as semiconductor companies delivering greater portions of the systems into which their ic products are integrated our products and services enable our customers to design complex and innovative electronic products so demand for our products is driven by our customers’ investment in new designs and products historically the industry that provided the tools used by ic engineers was referred to as eda today our offerings include and extend beyond eda tools to include sde 

we combine our products and technologies into categories related to major design activities 

 for additional information about our products see the discussion in item 1 “business” under the heading “products and product strategy” 

we have identified certain items that management uses as performance indicators to manage our business including revenue certain elements of operating expenses and cash flow from operations and we describe these items further below under the headings “results of operations” and “liquidity and capital resources” 

results of operations 

financial results for fiscal 2018  as compared to fiscal 2017  and 2016  reflect the following 

 the adoption of topic 606 limits the comparability of revenue and certain expenses including sales commissions presented in the results of operations for fiscal 2018 when compared to the fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016 for additional information regarding the adoption of this and other accounting standards at the beginning of fiscal 2018 see note 2 in the notes to consolidated financial statements under the heading “recently adopted accounting standards” 

our fiscal years are 52 or 53week periods ending on the saturday closest to december 31 fiscal 2018  2017  and 2016  were each 52week fiscal years 

revenue 

we primarily generate revenue from licensing our software and ip selling or leasing our emulation and prototyping hardware technology providing maintenance for our software hardware and ip providing engineering services and earning royalties generated from the use of our ip the timing of our revenue is significantly affected by the mix of software hardware and ip products generating revenue in any given period and whether the revenue is recognized over time or at a point in time upon completion of delivery 

approximately 90 of our revenue is recognized over time and the remainder of the resulting revenue is recognized at the point in time that control is transferred to the customer revenue recognized over time includes revenue from our software arrangements services royalties from certain ip arrangements maintenance on ip licenses and hardware and operating leases of hardware revenue recognized at a point in time is primarily generated by our sales of emulation and prototyping hardware and ip licenses our ability to maintain this mix in any single fiscal period may be impacted primarily by delivery of hardware and ip products to our customers 

during fiscal 2018 we recognized revenue based on asu 201409 “revenue from contracts with customers topic 606” whereas during fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016 we recognized revenue based on “revenue recognition topic 605” therefore the periods are not directly comparable for additional information on the impact of the new accounting standard on our revenue see note 2 in the notes to consolidated financial statements under the heading “recently adopted accounting standards” 

revenue by year 

the following table shows our revenue for fiscal 2018  2017  and 2016  and the change in revenue between years 



product and maintenance revenue increased during fiscal 2018  as compared to fiscal 2017  primarily because of increased investments by our customers in new complex designs for their products resulting in revenue growth in each of our five product categories product and maintenance revenue may fluctuate from period to period and by geography based on demand for our hardware and ip offerings product and maintenance revenue increased during fiscal 2017  as compared to fiscal 2016  primarily because of growth in our software and ip businesses partially offset by lower revenue from emulation and prototyping hardware 

services revenue may fluctuate from period to period based on the timing of fulfillment of our services and ip performance obligations 

no one customer accounted for 10  or more of total revenue during fiscal 2018  2017  or 2016  

revenue by product group 

the following table shows the percentage of product and related maintenance revenue contributed by each of our five product groups and services during fiscal 2018  2017  and 2016  



revenue by product group fluctuates from period to period based on demand for our products and services and our available resources to deliver and support them certain of our licensing arrangements allow customers the ability to remix among software products additionally we have arrangements with customers that include a combination of our products with the actual product selection and number of licensed users to be determined at a later date for these arrangements we estimate the allocation of the revenue to product groups based upon the expected usage of our products the actual usage of our products by these customers may differ and if that proves to be the case the revenue allocation in the table above would differ 

  revenue by geography 



for the primary factors contributing to the increase in revenue for the united states asia and europe middle east and africa during fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017 see the general description under “revenue by year” above revenue for the united states decreased during fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016 primarily due to lower revenue from emulation and prototyping hardware and services partially offset by growth in revenue from software and ip for the primary factors contributing to the increase in revenue for other americas asia and europe middle east and africa and japan during fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016 see the general description under “revenue by year” above 

revenue by geography as a percent of total revenue 



most of our revenue is transacted in the united states dollar however certain revenue transactions are denominated in foreign currencies for an additional description of how changes in foreign exchange rates affect our consolidated financial statements see the discussion under item 7a “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk – foreign currency risk” 

cost of revenue 

  

the following table shows cost of revenue as a percentage of related revenue for fiscal 2018  2017  and 2016  

  

cost of product and maintenance 

cost of product and maintenance includes costs associated with the sale and lease of our emulation and prototyping hardware and licensing of our software and ip products certain employee salary and benefits and other employeerelated costs cost of our customer support services amortization of technologyrelated and maintenancerelated acquired intangibles costs of technical documentation and royalties payable to thirdparty vendors costs associated with our emulation and prototyping hardware products include components assembly testing applicable reserves and overhead these costs make our cost of emulation and prototyping hardware products higher as a percentage of revenue than our cost of software and ip products 

a summary of cost of product and maintenance for fiscal 2018  2017  and 2016  is as follows 

  

cost of product and maintenance depends primarily on our hardware product sales in any given period cost of product and maintenance is also affected by employee salary and benefits and other employeerelated costs reserves for inventory as well as the timing and extent to which we acquire intangible assets acquire or license thirdparties’ intellectual property or technology and sell our products that include such acquired or licensed intellectual property or technology 

the changes in product and maintenancerelated costs were due to the following 



costs of emulation and prototyping increased during fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017 primarily due to increased sales volume for emulation and prototyping hardware and related costs costs of emulation and prototyping hardware decreased during fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016 primarily due to decreased sales volume for emulation and prototyping hardware gross margins on our hardware products will fluctuate based on product life cycle product competition product mix and pricing strategies 

cost of services 

cost of services primarily includes employee salary benefits and other employeerelated costs to perform work on revenuegenerating projects costs to maintain the infrastructure necessary to manage a services organization and provisions for contract losses if any cost of services will fluctuate from period to period based on our utilization of design services engineers on revenuegenerating projects or on internal development projects cost of services increased during fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017 and during fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016 primarily due to variation in the number of personnel dedicated to deliver and support our services and custom ip offerings 

  operating expenses 

our operating expenses include marketing and sales research and development and general and administrative expenses factors that tend to cause our operating expenses to fluctuate include changes in the number of employees due to hiring and acquisitions restructuring activities foreign exchange rate movements stockbased compensation and the impact of our variable compensation programs that are driven by operating results 

stockbased compensation included in our operating expenses increased during fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016 primarily because successive increases in the price of our common stock between grant dates have resulted in higher grant date fair values for the mix of stock awards expensed in each period we expect stockbased compensation to increase operating expenses during fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018 for further discussion regarding stockbased compensation see note 10 in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

many of our operating expenses are transacted in various foreign currencies we recognize lower expenses in periods when the united states dollar strengthens in value against other currencies and we recognize higher expenses when the united states dollar weakens against other currencies for an additional description of how changes in foreign exchange rates affect our consolidated financial statements see the discussion in item 7a “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk – foreign currency risk” 

our operating expenses for fiscal 2018  2017  and 2016  were as follows 



our operating expenses as a percentage of total revenue for fiscal 2018  2017  and 2016  were as follows 



  

marketing and sales 

the changes in marketing and sales expense were due to the following 



costs included in marketing and sales increased during fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017 and during fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016 primarily due to additional headcount in fiscal 2018 and an increase in incentive compensation 

research and development 

the changes in research and development expense were due to the following 



we must invest significantly in product research and development to keep pace with the latest manufacturing technology the demand for new ic manufacturing technology directly impacts the demand for our newest products and we must keep pace with our customers’ technical developments satisfy industry standards and meet our customers’ increasingly demanding performance productivity quality and predictability requirements costs included in research and development increased during fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017 and during fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016 primarily due to incremental investments in research and development as a result of additional hiring and incremental costs resulting from our fiscal 2017 acquisitions 

general and administrative 

the changes in general and administrative expense were due to the following 



 general and administrative costs decreased during fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017 primarily due to decreases in expense related to our nonqualified deferred compensation plan that are included in salary benefits and other employeerelated costs partially offset by increases in reserves on receivables from our customers general and administrative costs increased during fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016 primarily due to an increase in accounting and tax services and an increase in employee salaries and benefits 

amortization of acquired intangibles 



the changes in amortization of acquired intangibles were due to the following 



restructuring and other charges 

we have initiated restructuring plans in recent years to better align our resources with our business strategy because the restructuring charges and related benefits are derived from management’s estimates made during the formulation of the restructuring plans based on thencurrently available information our restructuring plans may not achieve the benefits anticipated on the timetable or at the level contemplated additional actions including further restructuring of our operations may be required in the future 

the following table presents restructuring and other charges net for our restructuring plans 



for an additional description of our restructuring plans see note 12 in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

interest expense 

interest expense for fiscal 2018  2017  and 2016  was comprised of the following 



 during fiscal 2018 we prepaid the outstanding principal balance and accrued interest on our 3000 million 2019 term loan for an additional description of our debt arrangements see note 3 in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

income taxes 

the following table presents the provision for income taxes and the effective tax rate for fiscal 2018  2017  and 2016  



our provision for income taxes for fiscal 2018 primarily resulted from the federal income tax effects of the tax act and state and foreign income taxes on fiscal 2018 income partially offset by 213 million of tax benefit related to stockbased compensation that vested or was exercised during the year 

during fiscal 2018 we finalized our fiscal 2017 deemed repatriation transition tax calculation and reduced our estimate from 672 million to 658 million we finalized our other fiscal 2017 provisional estimates without change for further discussion regarding our accounting for the tax act see note 6 in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

our provision for income taxes for fiscal 2017 is primarily attributable to income tax effects of the tax act the provisional amount related to the transition tax was 672 million and the provisional amount related to the remeasurement of our us deferred tax assets and liabilities for the us tax rate reduction was 252 million our provision for income taxes for fiscal 2017 included 320 million of tax benefit related to stockbased compensation that vested or settled during the period 

our provision for income taxes for fiscal 2016 is primarily attributable to federal state and foreign income taxes on our fiscal 2016 income and includes the tax benefit resulting from the permanent reinstatement of the united states research tax credit in december 2015 during fiscal 2016 we adopted a new accounting standard related to the accounting for stockbased compensation that required all income tax effects of stockbased awards to be recognized in our consolidated income statement as the awards vest or are settled our provision for income taxes for fiscal 2016 includes 172 million of tax benefit related to stockbased compensation that vested or settled during the period 

our future effective tax rates may be materially impacted by tax amounts associated with our foreign earnings at rates different from the united states federal statutory rate research credits the tax impact of stockbased compensation accounting for uncertain tax positions business combinations closure of statutes of limitations or settlement of tax audits changes in valuation allowance and changes in tax law a significant amount of our foreign earnings is generated by our subsidiaries organized in ireland and hungary our future effective tax rates may be adversely affected if our earnings were to be lower in countries where we have lower statutory tax rates we currently expect that our fiscal 2019 effective tax rate will be approximately 10 we expect that our quarterly effective tax rates will vary from our fiscal 2019 effective tax rate as a result of recognizing the income tax effects of stockbased awards in the quarterly periods that the awards vest or are settled and other items that we cannot anticipate we may also revise our fiscal 2019 effective tax rate as a result of further analyzing the implications of the tax act including future guidance issued by the us department of treasury and the irs for additional discussion about how our effective tax rate could be affected by various risks see part i item 1a “risk factors” for further discussion regarding our income taxes see note 6 in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

 liquidity and capital resources 



cash and cash equivalents 

as of december 29 2018  our principal sources of liquidity consisted of 5333 million  of cash and cash equivalents as compared to 6881 million  as of december 30 2017  

our primary sources of cash and cash equivalents during fiscal 2018  were cash generated from operations proceeds from borrowings under our revolving credit facility proceeds from the exercise of stock options and proceeds from stock purchases under our employee stock purchase plan 

our primary uses of cash and cash equivalents during fiscal 2018  were payments related to salaries and benefits operating expenses principal payments on the 2019 term loan repurchases of our common stock purchases of nonmarketable investments payments on our revolving credit facility tax payments and purchases of property plant and equipment 

 approximately 75  of our cash and cash equivalents were held by our foreign subsidiaries as of december 29 2018  we expect that current cash and cash equivalent balances cash flows that are generated from operations and cash borrowings available under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to meet our domestic and international working capital needs and other capital and liquidity requirements including acquisitions and share repurchases for at least the next 12 months 

net working capital 

net working capital is comprised of current assets less current liabilities as shown on our consolidated balance sheets the decrease in our net working capital as of december 29 2018  as compared to december 30 2017  is primarily due to a decrease in cash and cash equivalents and increases in current liabilities partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable 

cash flows from operating activities 

cash flows from operating activities during fiscal 2018  2017  and 2016  were as follows 



cash flows from operating activities include net income adjusted for certain noncash items as well as changes in the balances of certain assets and liabilities our cash flows from operating activities are significantly influenced by business levels and the payment terms set forth in our customer agreements the increase in cash flows from operating activities during fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016 was primarily due to the improved results from operations and timing of cash receipts from customers and disbursements made to vendors 

cash flows from investing activities 

cash flows provided by used for investing activities during fiscal 2018  2017  and 2016  were as follows 



the decrease in cash used for investing activities during fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017 was primarily because we did not acquire any businesses in fiscal 2018 offset by payments to acquire equity instruments of other entities the increase in cash used for investing activities during fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016 was primarily due to an increase in cash paid for business combinations and a decrease in net proceeds from our investment portfolio we expect to continue our investing activities including purchasing property plant and equipment purchasing intangible assets business combinations purchasing software licenses and making strategic investments 

cash flows from financing activities 

cash flows used for financing activities during fiscal 2018  2017  and 2016  were as follows 



the increase in cash used for financing activities during fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017 was primarily due to the prepayment of the outstanding principal balance on our 3000 million  2019 term loan an increase in repurchases of common stock and a decrease in net proceeds on our revolving credit facility the decrease in cash used for financing activities during fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016 was primarily due to a decrease in payments made to repurchase shares of our common stock partially offset by a net decrease in proceeds from borrowings 

other factors affecting liquidity and capital resources 

stock repurchase program 

in january 2017 our board of directors authorized the repurchase of shares of our common stock with a value of up to 5250 million  in the aggregate as of december 29 2018  approximately 1750 million  remained available under this authorization in february 2019 our board of directors authorized the additional repurchase of shares of our common stock with a value of up to 5000 million in the aggregate the actual timing and amount of future repurchases are subject to business and market conditions corporate and regulatory requirements stock price acquisition opportunities and other factors see part ii item 5 “market for registrant’s common equity related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities” for additional information 

revolving credit facility 

our senior unsecured revolving credit facility provides for borrowings up to 3500 million  with the right to request increased capacity up to an additional 2500 million  upon the receipt of lender commitments for total maximum borrowings of 6000 million  the credit facility expires on january 28 2022 and currently has no subsidiary guarantors any outstanding loans drawn under the credit facility are due at maturity on january 28 2022 outstanding borrowings may be paid at any time prior to maturity as of december 29 2018  there were 1000 million  of borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility and we were in compliance with all financial covenants associated with the revolving credit facility 

2024 notes 

in october 2014 we issued 3500 million  aggregate principal amount of 4375  senior notes due october 15 2024 we received net proceeds of 3424 million  from the issuance of the 2024 notes net of a discount of 14 million  and issuance costs of 62 million  interest is payable in cash semiannually the 2024 notes are unsecured and rank equal in right of payment to all of our existing and future senior indebtedness as of december 29 2018  we were in compliance with all covenants associated with the 2024 notes 

for additional information relating to our debt arrangements see note 3 in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

contractual obligations 

a summary of our contractual obligations as of december 29 2018  is as follows 



 



offbalance sheet arrangements 

as of december 29 2018  we did not have any significant offbalance sheet arrangements as defined in item 303a4ii of sec regulation sk 

critical accounting estimates 

in preparing our consolidated financial statements we make assumptions judgments and estimates that can have a significant impact on our revenue operating income and net income as well as on the value of certain assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets we base our assumptions judgments and estimates on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions at least quarterly we evaluate our assumptions judgments and estimates and make changes as deemed necessary 

we believe that the assumptions judgments and estimates involved in the accounting for income taxes revenue recognition and business combinations have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements therefore we consider these to be our critical accounting estimates for information on our significant accounting policies see note 2 in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

accounting for income taxes 

we are subject to income taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our provision for these taxes there are many transactions that occur during the ordinary course of business for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain the tax act has many provisions that require additional guidance on specific interpretations of the tax law changes our provision for income taxes could be adversely affected by our earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries where we have higher statutory rates losses incurred in jurisdictions for which we are not able to realize the related tax benefit changes in foreign currency exchange rates entry into new businesses and geographies and changes to our existing businesses acquisitions and investments changes in our deferred tax assets and liabilities including changes in our assessment of valuation allowances changes in the relevant tax laws or interpretations of these tax laws and developments in current and future tax examinations 

we only recognize the tax benefit of an income tax position if we judge that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained solely on its technical merits in a tax audit including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes to make this judgment we must interpret complex and sometimes ambiguous tax laws regulations and administrative practices if we judge that an income tax position meets this recognition threshold then we must measure the amount of the tax benefit to be recognized by estimating the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50 cumulative probability of being realized upon settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all of the relevant facts it is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts as this requires us to determine the probability of various possible settlement outcomes we must reevaluate our income tax positions on a quarterly basis to consider factors such as changes in facts or circumstances changes in tax law effectively settled issues under audit the lapse of applicable statute of limitations and new audit activity such a change in recognition or measurement would result in recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision for a more detailed description of our unrecognized tax benefits see note 6 in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition 

our contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple software andor ip licenses hardware and services including professional services technical support services and rights to unspecified updates to a customer determining whether licenses and services are distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately or not distinct and thus accounted for together requires significant judgment in some arrangements such as most of our ip license arrangements we have concluded that the licenses and associated services are distinct from each other in other arrangements like our timebased software arrangements the licenses and certain services are not distinct from each other our timebased software arrangements include multiple software licenses and updates to the licensed software products as well as technical support and we have concluded that these promised goods and services are a single combined performance obligation 

judgment is required to determine the standalone selling prices “ssps” for each distinct performance obligation we rarely license or sell products on a standalone basis so we are required to estimate the ssp for each performance obligation in instances where the ssp is not directly observable because we do not sell the license product or service separately we determine the ssp using information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs we typically have more than one ssp for individual performance obligations due to the stratification of those items by classes of customers and circumstances in these instances we may use information such as the size of the customer and geographic region of the customer in determining the ssp 

revenue is recognized over time for our combined performance obligations that include software licenses updates and technical support as well as for maintenance and professional services that are separate performance obligations for our professional services revenue is recognized over time generally using costs incurred or hours expended to measure progress judgment is required in estimating project status and the costs necessary to complete projects a number of internal and external factors can affect these estimates including labor rates utilization and efficiency variances and specification and testing requirement changes for our other performance obligations recognized over time revenue is generally recognized using a timebased measure of progress reflecting generally consistent efforts to satisfy those performance obligations throughout the arrangement term 

if a group of agreements are so closely related that they are in effect part of a single arrangement such agreements are deemed to be one arrangement for revenue recognition purposes we exercise significant judgment to evaluate the relevant facts and circumstances in determining whether the separate agreements should be accounted for separately or as in substance a single arrangement our judgments about whether a group of contracts comprise a single arrangement can affect the allocation of consideration to the distinct performance obligations which could have an effect on results of operations for the periods involved 

we are required to estimate the total consideration expected to be received from contracts with customers in some circumstances the consideration expected to be received is variable based on the specific terms of the contract or based on our expectations of the term of the contract generally we have not experienced significant returns or refunds to customers these estimates require significant judgment and the change in these estimates could have an effect on our results of operations during the periods involved 

business combinations 

when we acquire businesses we allocate the purchase price to the acquired tangible assets and assumed liabilities including deferred revenue liabilities associated with the fair value of contingent consideration and acquired identifiable intangible assets any residual purchase price is recorded as goodwill the allocation of the purchase price requires us to make significant estimates in determining the fair values of these acquired assets and assumed liabilities especially with respect to intangible assets and goodwill these estimates are based on information obtained from management of the acquired companies our assessment of this information and historical experience these estimates can include but are not limited to the cash flows that an acquired business is expected to generate in the future the cash flows that specific assets acquired with that business are expected to generate in the future the appropriate weightedaverage cost of capital and the cost savings expected to be derived from acquiring an asset these estimates are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and if different estimates were used the purchase price for the acquisition could be allocated to the acquired assets and assumed liabilities differently from the allocation that we have made to the acquired assets and assumed liabilities in addition unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that may affect the accuracy or validity of such estimates and if such events occur we may be required to adjust the value allocated to acquired assets or assumed liabilities 

we also make significant judgments and estimates when we assign useful lives to the definitelived intangible assets identified as part of our acquisitions these estimates are inherently uncertain and if we used different estimates the useful life over which we amortize intangible assets would be different in addition unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that may impact the useful life assigned to our intangible assets which would impact our amortization of intangible assets expense and our results of operations 

new accounting standards 

leases 

in february 2016 the fasb issued asu 201602 “leases topic 842” requiring among other things the recognition of lease liabilities and corresponding rightofuse assets on the balance sheet by lessees for all leases with a term longer than 12 months the new standard is effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 a modified retrospective approach is required applying the new standard to leases existing as of the date of initial application an entity may choose to apply the standard as of either its effective date or the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements we adopted the new standard on december 30 2018 the first day of fiscal 2019 and used the effective date as our date of initial application consequently financial information will not be updated and the disclosures required under the new standard will not be provided for dates and periods prior to the first quarter of fiscal 2019 we elected certain practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance within the new standard which among other things allowed us to carry forward our prior conclusions about lease identification and classification 

we estimate the key change upon adoption of the standard will result in balance sheet recognition of additional lease assets and lease liabilities ranging from 75 to 85 million as of december 30 2018 which is based on the present value of committed lease payments we do not expect the adoption of the new standard to have a material impact on the recognition measurement or presentation of lease expenses within our consolidated income statements consolidated statements of comprehensive income or consolidated statements of cash flows 

the new standard also provides updated guidance for lessor accounting however we do not expect the new standard to have a material effect on our financial statements for arrangements in which we are the lessor 

credit losses 

in june 2016 the fasb issued asu 201613 “measurement of credit losses on financial instruments” which supersedes current guidance requiring recognition of credit losses when it is probable that a loss has been incurred the new standard requires the establishment of an allowance for estimated credit losses on financial assets including trade and other receivables at each reporting date the new standard will result in earlier recognition of allowances for losses on trade and other receivables and other contractual rights to receive cash the new standard will be effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 and early adoption is permitted we are currently reviewing this standard to assess the impact on our consolidated financial statements and the related disclosures 

goodwill impairment 

in january 2017 the fasb issued asu 201704 “simplifying the test for goodwill impairment” that eliminates “step 2” from the goodwill impairment test the new standard is effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 and early adoption is permitted the new guidance must be applied on a prospective basis we do not anticipate that the adoption of this standard will have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements or the related disclosures 

income tax effects within accumulated other comprehensive income 

in february 2018 the fasb issued asu 201802 “reclassification of certain tax effects from accumulated other comprehensive income” which allows a reclassification of the income tax effects of the tax act on items within accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings the new guidance may be applied at the beginning of the period of adoption or retrospectively to each period in which the effect of the change in federal income tax rate from the tax act is recognized the new standard became effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 we do not anticipate that the adoption of this standard will impact our consolidated financial statements or the related disclosures 

stockbased compensation 

in june 2018 the fasb issued asu 201807 “improvements to nonemployee sharebased payment accounting” to simplify the accounting for sharebased transactions with nonemployees in which the grantor acquires goods or services to be used or consumed under the new standard most of the guidance on recording sharebased compensation granted to nonemployees will be aligned with the requirements for sharebased compensation granted to employees this standard became effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 and early adoption is permitted we do not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

fair value measurements

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

foreign currency risk 

a material portion of our revenue expenses and business activities are transacted in the us dollar in certain foreign countries where we price our products and services in us dollars a decrease in value of the local currency relative to the us dollar results in an increase in the prices for our products and services compared to those products of our competitors that are priced in local currency this could result in our prices being uncompetitive in certain markets 

in certain countries where we may invoice customers in the local currency our revenues benefit from a weaker dollar and are adversely affected by a stronger dollar the opposite impact occurs in countries where we record expenses in local currencies in those cases our costs and expenses benefit from a stronger dollar and are adversely affected by a weaker dollar the fluctuations in our operating expenses outside the united states resulting from volatility in foreign exchange rates are not generally moderated by corresponding fluctuations in revenues from existing contracts 

we enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to protect against currency exchange risks associated with existing assets and liabilities a foreign currency forward exchange contract acts as a hedge by increasing in value when underlying assets decrease in value or underlying liabilities increase in value due to changes in foreign exchange rates conversely a foreign currency forward exchange contract decreases in value when underlying assets increase in value or underlying liabilities decrease in value due to changes in foreign exchange rates these forward contracts are not designated as accounting hedges so the unrealized gains and losses are recognized in other income net in advance of the actual foreign currency cash flows with the fair value of these forward contracts being recorded as accrued liabilities or other current assets 

we do not use forward contracts for trading purposes our forward contracts generally have maturities of 90 days or less we enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts based on estimated future asset and liability exposures and the effectiveness of our hedging program depends on our ability to estimate these future asset and liability exposures recognized gains and losses with respect to our current hedging activities will ultimately depend on how accurately we are able to match the amount of foreign currency forward exchange contracts with actual underlying asset and liability exposures 

the following table provides information about our foreign currency forward exchange contracts as of december 29 2018  the information is provided in united states dollar equivalent amounts the table presents the notional amounts at contract exchange rates and the weighted average contractual foreign currency exchange rates expressed as units of the foreign currency per united states dollar which in some cases may not be the market convention for quoting a particular currency all of these forward contracts matured during february 2019  



we actively monitor our foreign currency risks but our foreign currency hedging activities may not substantially offset the impact of fluctuations in currency exchange rates on our results of operations cash flows and financial position 

interest rate risk 

our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our portfolio of cash and cash equivalents and balances outstanding on our revolving credit facility if any we are exposed to interest rate fluctuations in many of the world’s leading industrialized countries but our interest income and expense is most sensitive to fluctuations in the general level of united states interest rates in this regard changes in united states interest rates affect the interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents and the costs associated with foreign currency hedges 

all highly liquid securities with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase are considered to be cash equivalents the carrying value of our interestbearing instruments approximated fair value as of december 29 2018  

interest rates under our revolving credit facility are variable so interest expense could be adversely affected by changes in interest rates particularly for periods when we maintain a balance outstanding under the revolving credit facility interest rates for our revolving credit facility can fluctuate based on changes in market interest rates and in an interest rate margin that varies based on our consolidated leverage ratio as of december 29 2018  there were 1000 million  borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility for an additional description of the revolving credit facility see note 3 in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

equity price risk 

equity investments 

we have a portfolio of equity investments that includes marketable equity securities and nonmarketable investments our equity investments are made primarily in connection with our strategic investment program under our strategic investment program from time to time we make cash investments in companies with technologies that are potentially strategically important to us see note 7 in the notes to consolidated financial statements for an additional description of these investments 




 item 9 changes in and disagreements with accountants on accounting and financial disclosure 

none 




 item 9a controls and procedures 

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

as required by rule 13a15 of the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended the “exchange act” under the supervision and with the participation of our management including our chief executive officer “ceo” and our chief financial officer “cfo” we evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rules 13a15e and 15d15e under the exchange act as of december 29 2018  

the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures included a review of our processes and the effect on the information generated for use in this annual report on form 10k in the course of this evaluation we sought to identify any material weaknesses in our disclosure controls and procedures to determine whether we had identified any acts of fraud involving personnel who have a significant role in our disclosure controls and procedures and to confirm that any necessary corrective action including process improvements was taken this type of evaluation is done every fiscal quarter so that our conclusions concerning the effectiveness of these controls can be reported in our periodic reports filed with the sec the overall goals of these evaluation activities are to monitor our disclosure controls and procedures and to make modifications as necessary we intend to maintain these disclosure controls and procedures modifying them as circumstances warrant 

based on their evaluation as of december 29 2018  our ceo and cfo have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by us in our reports filed or submitted under the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the sec’s rules and forms and is accumulated and communicated to our management including the ceo and cfo as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure 

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the fiscal quarter ended december 29 2018  that materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting 

inherent limitations on effectiveness of controls 

our management including our ceo and cfo does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud internal control over financial reporting no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of internal control are met further the design of internal control must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of the control must be considered relative to their costs while our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance of their effectiveness because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within cadence have been detected 

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rule 13a15f under the exchange act our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 29 2018  in making this assessment our management used the criteria established in internal controlintegrated framework 2013 issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission “coso” our management has concluded that as of december 29 2018  our internal control over financial reporting is effective based on these criteria our independent registered public accounting firm kpmg llp has issued an attestation report on our internal control over financial reporting which is included in part iv item 15 “exhibits and financial statement schedules”

overview 

we enable our customers to design electronic products our products and services are designed to give our customers a competitive edge in their development of electronic systems integrated circuits “ics” electronic devices and increasingly sophisticated manufactured products our products and services do this by optimizing performance minimizing power consumption shortening the time to bring our customers’ products to market and reducing their design development and manufacturing costs our customers create and sell electronic products at differing levels of completeness our electronic systems customers deliver entire devices such as smartphones laptop computers gaming systems automobiles servers medical equipment and networking products these systems companies internally develop or externally purchase the subcomponents for their products including printed circuit boards “pcbs” which interconnect all the hardware components ics which are often referred to as computer chips and software at various levels which runs on the hardware our semiconductor customers deliver ics which include subcategories such as memory chips systemsonchip “socs” analog chips processors and other types of chips 

we offer software hardware services and reusable ic design blocks which are commonly referred to as intellectual property “ip” systems customers use our offerings to develop and integrate software that is key to the functionality of their products as well as to design their ics and pcbs our semiconductor customers use our offerings to design configure analyze and verify ics additionally some customers license our ip which accelerates their product development processes by providing predesigned and verified circuit blocks for their ics 

our strategy which we call system design enablement “sde” is to provide the technologies necessary for our customers to develop a complete and functional electronic product our sde strategy enables us to address the growing trends of electronic systems companies developing their own ics as part of their end product systems as well as semiconductor companies delivering greater portions of the systems into which their ic products are integrated the development of electronic products or their subcomponents is complex and requires many engineers using our solutions with specialized knowledge and skill the rate of technical innovation in electronics is swift long driven by a concept known as moore’s law which more than 50 years ago predicted that the complexity of ics would double about every 24 months in order to make our customers successful our products must handle this exponential growth rate in complexity without requiring a corresponding increase in our customers’ costs historically the industry that provided the tools used by ic engineers was referred to as electronic design automation “eda” today our offerings include and extend beyond eda tools to include sde 

our sde solutions facilitate the electronic product creation process at four levels first our core eda offerings enable engineers to complete tasks associated with the design analysis and verification of ics core eda tools and services are specifically designed to meet the requirements of engineers who develop different types of ics the second level of sde solutions is ip which consists of design ip and verification ip “vip” design ip is directly integrated into the ic by the customer as part of its development process vip consists of technologies and methodologies useful for verifying how design ip is integrated into the ic but vip does not become part of the ic product the third level of sde solutions is system interconnect and includes tools and services used for the design analysis and verification of pcbs as well as the packages that encapsulate the ics for electrical and physical connection to the pcb the fourth level of sde solutions is system integration which includes the engineering tasks associated with designing and analyzing systems verifying system functionality combining software with hardware or developing new software for an ic or system prior to its manufacture 

business drivers 

our products and services enable our customers to design complex and innovative electronic products so demand for our products is driven by our customers’ investment in new designs and products the most promising new opportunities for us involve enabling the design of electronic systems for machine learning augmented reality virtual reality internetofthings aerospace and defense and autonomous vehicle subsystems large and existing electronics categories such as datacenter servers smartphones and networking products continue to provide business opportunities for us as customers initiate new design projects conversely the decline of previously vibrant categories and the integration of previously separate capabilities into a single device can potentially reduce our business opportunities for example digital cameras and navigation devices were once independent devices and are now also available as features on a smartphone likewise the laptop computer category has been negatively affected by the proliferation of mobile devices 

underlying the requirements within any particular vertical market sector is the availability of rapidly improving ic manufacturing technology in order for our customers to take advantage of such advancements certain of our products must first be developed to exploit these new manufacturing capabilities this dependency means that we must invest significantly in product research and development to keep pace with the latest manufacturing technology the demand for new ic manufacturing technology directly impacts the demand for our newest products 

another driver for our business is the differentiation capabilities and benefits provided to our customers by our products with the rapid pace of innovation comes the opportunity for our products to address key challenges associated with electronic product creation such as power consumption performance and cost our products have unique attributes that our customers value in general these attributes can be grouped into broader categories such as quality of results in terms of power consumption performance and chip area engineering productivity tool performance new capabilities or methods and faster timetomarket our business opportunities are significantly enhanced when our offerings address these key factors 

products and product strategy 

our strategy is to provide our customers with the ability to address the broad range of issues that arise as they develop electronic products our sde solutions are comprised of products that are categorized according to the role they play in the electronic product design process we combine our products and technologies into categories related to major design activities the following table shows the relationship between our product categories and the sde levels to which they relate

product and maintenance and services revenue 

revenue and revenue as a percentage of total revenue from our product and maintenance and services offerings for the last three fiscal years were as follows 



our revenue mix is such that approximately 90 of our revenue is recognized over the contract life and the remainder of the revenue is recognized up front upon completion of delivery 

for an additional description of our product and maintenance and services revenue see the discussion under “results of operations” under part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” for our fiscal 2016 results of operations and our financial position as of december 30 2017  see part iv item 15 “exhibits and financial statement schedules” 

backlog 

our backlog was  27 billion  and 25 billion  as of december 30 2017  and december 31 2016  respectively our backlog as of december 30 2017  consisted of the deferred revenue on our balance sheet and the remaining unbilled portion of fully executed arrangements with effective dates commencing no later than december 30 2017  with revenue to be recognized thereafter and included a variety of types generally including but not limited to 



 the substantial majority of our backlog consists of customer contracts for which product and maintenance revenue is recognized over the contract life historically we have not experienced significant cancellations of our contracts with customers for engineering services contracts in backlog completion dates are occasionally rescheduled delaying revenue recognition under those contracts beyond the original anticipated completion date during fiscal 2017  approximately 70  of our revenue came from arrangements that were in backlog as of december 31 2016  we expect 14 billion  or approximately 70  of our fiscal 2018 revenue to come from arrangements that were in backlog as of december 30 2017  the actual percentage of revenue coming from backlog during fiscal 2018 may change if our actual business levels in fiscal 2018 are different than our current expectations 

marketing and sales 

we generally market our products and provide services to existing and prospective customers through a direct sales force consisting of sales people and applications engineers applications engineers provide technical presales and postsales support for our products due to the complexity of many of our products and the system design process the sales cycle is generally long requiring three to six months or more during the sales cycle our direct sales force generally provides technical presentations product demonstrations and support for onsite customer evaluation of our solutions we also promote our products and services through advertising marketing automation trade shows public relations and the internet we selectively utilize valueadded resellers to broaden our reach and reduce cost of sales our orcad products and certain allegro products are primarily marketed through these channels with respect to international sales we generally market and support our products and services through our subsidiaries we also use a thirdparty distributor to license our software products and services to certain customers in japan 

research and development 

our research and development expense was 8042 million  during fiscal 2017  7353 million  during fiscal 2016  and 6376 million  during fiscal 2015  

the primary areas of our research and development include the following 

 our future performance depends on our ability to innovate commercialize newly developed solutions and enhance and maintain our current products we must continuously reengineer our products to solve new or increased physics challenges that arise with each successive process node and address the increase in complexity that is introduced by the resulting much larger designs we must also keep pace with our customers’ technical developments satisfy industry standards and meet our customers’ increasingly demanding performance productivity quality and predictability requirements therefore we expect to continue to invest in research and development 

hardware manufacturing and software distribution 

our emulation and prototyping hardware including all individual pcbs custom ics and fpgabased prototyping products is manufactured assembled and tested by subcontractors before delivery to our customers software and documentation are primarily distributed to customers by secure electronic delivery or on dvd

 item 1a risk factors 

our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties including those described in the sections below that could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations cash flows and the trading price of our common stock 

risks related to our business 

any periods of uncertainty in the global economy in general and any potential downturn in the semiconductor and electronics industries in particular may negatively impact our business and reduce our bookings levels and revenue 

purchases of our products and services are dependent upon the commencement of new design projects by ic manufacturers and electronics systems companies the ic and electronics systems industries are cyclical and are characterized by constant and rapid technological change rapid product obsolescence and price erosion evolving standards short product life cycles and wide fluctuations in product supply and demand 

the ic and electronics systems industries have also experienced significant downturns in connection with or in anticipation of maturing product cycles of both these industries’ and their customers’ products while spending on eda products and services has grown in recent years the current outlook for the semiconductor industry is uncertain and may result in a decrease in spending on eda products and services which are a part of our overall sde offering 

while we cannot predict global economic conditions uncertainty about future political and economic conditions and future decline in consumer spending could negatively impact our customers’ businesses reducing the number of new chip designs and their overall research and development spending including their spending on our products and services and as a result decrease demand for our products decreased bookings for our products and services customer bankruptcies consolidation among our customers or problems or delays with our hardware suppliers or with the supply or delivery of our hardware products could also adversely affect our ability to grow our business or adversely affect our future revenues and financial results our future business and financial results are subject to considerable uncertainty that could impact our stock price if economic conditions deteriorate in the future or in particular if semiconductor or electronics systems industry revenues do not grow or our suppliers of our hardware components and products are subject to problems or delays our future revenues and financial results could be adversely affected however if economic conditions improve for our customers the positive impact on our revenues and financial results may be deferred due to cautious customer research and development spending and our mix of licenses that yield revenue recognized over time 

customer consolidation could affect our operating results 

there has been a trend toward customer consolidation in the semiconductor industry through business combinations including mergers asset acquisitions and strategic partnerships as this trend continues it could make us dependent on fewer customers who may be able to exert increased pressure on our prices and other contract terms and could increase the portion of our total sales concentration for any single customer customer consolidation activity could also reduce the demand for our products and services if such customers streamline research and development or operations reduce purchases or delay purchasing decisions these outcomes could negatively impact our financial condition 

our failure to respond quickly to technological developments or customers’ increasing technological requirements could make our products uncompetitive and obsolete 

the industries in which we compete experience rapid technology developments rapid changes in industry standards and customer requirements and frequent introductions and improvements of new products currently the industries we serve are experiencing the following trends 



 if we are unable to respond quickly and successfully to these trends we may lose our competitive position and our products or technologies may become obsolete to compete successfully we must develop acquire or license new products and improve our existing products and processes on a schedule that keeps pace with technological developments and the requirements for products addressing a broad spectrum of designers and designer expertise in our industries we must provide frequent and relevant updates to our software products in order to provide substantial benefit to the customer throughout the license periods because of the rapid changes in our customer’s industries the market must also accept our new and improved products our hardware platforms must be enhanced periodically to reduce the likelihood that a competitor surpasses the capabilities we offer our introduction of new products could reduce the demand and revenue of our older products or affect their pricing we must also be able to support a range of changing computer software hardware platforms and customer preferences a rapid transition to different business models associated with cloud computing technologies could result in reduced revenue we cannot guarantee that we will be successful in keeping pace with all or any of the customer trends 

competitive pressures may require us to reduce our pricing which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

the highly competitive markets in which we do business can put pressure on us to reduce the prices of our software emulation and prototyping hardware and ip if our competitors offer deep discounts on certain products in an effort to recapture or gain market share or to sell other software or hardware products we may then need to lower our prices or offer other favorable terms to compete successfully any such changes would be likely to reduce our profit margins and could adversely affect our operating results any substantial changes to our prices and pricing policies could cause revenues to decline or be delayed as our sales force implements and our customers adjust to the new pricing policies some of our competitors bundle products for promotional purposes or as a longterm pricing strategy or provide guarantees of prices and product implementations these practices could over time significantly constrain the prices that we can charge for our products if we cannot offset price reductions with a corresponding increase in the number of sales or with lower spending then the reduced revenues resulting from lower prices could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

our system design enablement strategy requires the development or acquisition of products and expertise in new areas of technology our inability to develop or acquire these capabilities could impede our ability to address the technical requirements in technology segments which are expected to contribute to our growth 

our sde strategy is meant to increase our business among electronic systems companies which are now designing their own ics sde is also meant to increase our business among semiconductor companies which are increasing their contribution to the end products into which their ics are incorporated part of this strategy involves addressing the needs of new categories of electronic systems including machine learning augmented reality virtual reality internetofthings and autonomous vehicle subsystems where increased investment is expected by our customers each of these categories requires technologies and expertise that are applicationspecific if we are unable to develop or acquire the applicationspecific technologies and expertise necessary to address the requirements of these categories it could impede our ability to expand our business in these categories and ultimately affect our future growth 

we have experienced varied operating results and our operating results for any particular fiscal period are affected by the timing of revenue recognition particularly for our emulation and prototyping hardware and ip products 

various factors affect our operating results and some of them are not within our control our operating results for any period are affected by the timing of revenue recognition particularly for our emulation and prototyping hardware and ip products in addition we have recorded net losses in the past and may record net losses in the future 

a substantial portion of the product revenue related to our hardware business and some of our ip offerings is recognized upon delivery and our forecasted revenue results are based in part on our expectations of hardware and ip to be delivered in a particular quarter therefore changes in hardware and ip bookings or deliveries relative to expectations will have a more immediate impact on our revenue than changes in software or services bookings for which revenue is generally recognized over time 

in recent years we made significant investments to expand our ip offerings through among other things research and development and acquisitions as we continue to expand our ip offerings a portion of the revenue related to our ip bookings will be deferred until we complete and deliver the licensed ip to our customers as a result costs related to the research and development of the ip may be incurred prior to the recognition of the related revenue 

revenue related to our hardware and ip products is inherently difficult to predict because sales of our hardware and ip products depend on the commencement of new projects for the design and development of complex ics and systems by our customers our customers’ willingness to expend capital to deploy our hardware or ip products in those projects and the availability of our hardware or ip products for delivery therefore our hardware or ip sales may be delayed or may decrease if our customers delay or cancel projects because their spending is constrained or if there are problems or delays with the supply or delivery of our hardware or ip products or our hardware suppliers moreover the hardware and ip markets are highly competitive and our customers may choose to purchase a competitor’s hardware or ip product based on cost performance or other factors these factors may result in lower revenue which would have an adverse effect on our business results of operations or cash flows 

a substantial proportion of our licenses yield revenue recognized over time which may make it difficult for us to rapidly increase our revenue in future fiscal periods 

we plan our operating expenses based on forecasted revenue expected business needs and other factors these expenses and the effect of longterm commitments are relatively fixed in the short term bookings and the related revenue are harder to forecast in a difficult economic environment if we experience a shortfall in bookings our operating results could differ from our expectations because we may not be able to quickly reduce our expenses in response to shortterm business changes 

the methods estimates and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies have a significant impact on our results of operations see “critical accounting estimates” under part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” such methods estimates and judgments are by their nature subject to substantial risks uncertainties and assumptions and factors may arise over time that may lead us to change our methods estimates and judgments changes in those methods estimates and judgments could significantly affect our results of operations 

historical results of operations should not be viewed as reliable indicators of our future performance if our revenue operating results or business outlook for future periods fall short of the levels expected by us securities analysts or investors the trading price of our common stock could decline 

we have invested and expect to continue to invest in research and development efforts for new and existing products and technologies and technical sales support such investments may affect our operating results and if the return on these investments is lower or develops more slowly than we expect our revenue and operating results may suffer 

we have invested and expect to continue to invest in research and development for new and existing products technologies and services in response to our customers’ increasing technological requirements such investments may be in related areas such as technical sales support these investments may involve significant time risks and uncertainties including the risk that the expenses associated with these investments may affect our margins and operating results and that such investments may not generate sufficient revenues to offset liabilities assumed and expenses associated with these new investments we believe that we must continue to invest a significant amount of time and resources in our research and development efforts and technical sales support to maintain and improve our competitive position if we do not achieve the benefits anticipated from these investments if the achievement of these benefits is delayed or if customers reduce or slow the need to upgrade or enhance their eda products and design flows our revenue and operating results may be adversely affected 

we have acquired and expect to acquire other companies and businesses and may not realize the expected benefits of these acquisitions 

we have acquired and expect to acquire other companies and businesses in order to expand our product offerings our future revenue growth and expansion of our business is dependent on our successful integration of our acquisitions we may incur significant costs in connection with potential transactions including acquisitions that are not consummated potential and completed acquisitions involve a number of risks if any of the following acquisitionrelated risks occur our business operating results or financial condition could be adversely impacted 



 in a number of our completed acquisitions we have agreed to make future payments either in the form of employee retention bonuses or contingent purchase price payments based on the achievement of specified milestones the performance goals pursuant to which these future payments may be made generally relate to the achievement by the acquired company or business or by the employees who joined us with the acquired company or business of certain specified bookings revenue run rate product proliferation product development or employee retention goals during a specified period following completion of the applicable acquisition the specific performance goal levels and amounts and timing of employee bonuses or contingent purchase price payments vary with each acquisition we may continue to use contingent purchase price payments in connection with acquisitions in the future and while we expect to derive value from an acquisition in excess of such contingent payment obligations we may be required to make certain contingent payments without deriving the anticipated value 

future acquisitions may involve issuances of stock as full or partial payment of the purchase price for the acquired company or business grants of restricted stock restricted stock units or stock options to employees of the acquired companies or businesses which may be dilutive to existing stockholders expenditure of substantial cash resources or the incurrence of a material amount of debt these arrangements may impact our liquidity financial position and results of operations or increase dilution of our stockholders’ equity interests in the company 

the competition in our industries is substantial and we may not be able to continue to successfully compete in our industries 

the eda industry the commercial electronics engineering services industry and the ip industry are highly competitive if we fail to compete successfully in these industries it could seriously harm our business operating results or financial condition to compete in these industries we must identify and develop or acquire innovative and costcompetitive eda products integrate them into platforms and market them in a timely manner we may not be able to compete successfully in these industries factors that could affect our ability to compete successfully include 

 we compete most frequently with synopsys inc and mentor graphics corporation which was acquired by siemens ag in 2017 and also with numerous other eda providers manufacturers of electronic devices that have developed acquired or have the capability to develop their own eda products electronics design and consulting companies and other ip companiesthese include altium limited ansys inc ceva inc keysight technologies inc and zuken ltd 

the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations may adversely impact our revenue expenses cash flows and financial condition 

we have significant operations outside the united states our revenue from international operations as a percentage of total revenue was approximately 58  during fiscal 2017 and 54  during both fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015 we expect that revenue from our international operations will continue to account for a significant portion of our total revenue we also transact business in various foreign currencies although the majority of our revenue contracts worldwide are denominated in us dollars volatility of currencies in countries where we conduct business most notably the us dollar chinese renminbi japanese yen european union euro british pound and indian rupee have had and may in the future have an effect on our revenue or operating results 

fluctuations in the rate of exchange between the us dollar and the currencies of other countries where we conduct business could seriously affect our business operating results or financial condition for example when a foreign currency declines in value relative to the us dollar it takes more of the foreign currency to purchase the same amount of us dollars than before the change if we price our products and services in the foreign currency we receive fewer us dollars than we did before the change if we price our products and services in us dollars the decrease in value of the local currency results in an increase in the price for our products and services compared to those products of our competitors that are priced in local currency this could result in our prices being uncompetitive in markets where business is transacted in the local currency on the other hand when a foreign currency increases in value relative to the us dollar it takes more us dollars to purchase the same amount of the foreign currency as we use the foreign currency to fund payroll costs and other operating expenses in our international operations this results in an increase in operating expenses approximately 30 of our total costs and expenses are transacted in foreign currencies our attempts to reduce the effect of foreign currency fluctuations may be unsuccessful and significant exchange rate movements may adversely impact our results of operations as expressed in us dollars 

our operating results could be adversely affected by an increase in our effective tax rate as a result of tax law changes outcomes of current or future tax examinations or by material differences between our forecasted and actual effective tax rates 

our operations are subject to income and transaction taxes in the united states and in multiple foreign jurisdictions with a significant amount of our foreign earnings generated by our subsidiaries organized in ireland and hungary any significant change in our future effective tax rates could adversely impact our results of operations for future periods our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by the following 

 the irs and other tax authorities regularly examine our income tax returns and other nonincome tax returns such as payroll sales use valueadded net worth or franchise property goods and services consumption import stamp and excise taxes in both the united states and foreign jurisdictions the calculation of our provision for income taxes and our accruals for other taxes requires us to use significant judgment and involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes we regularly assess the potential settlement outcomes resulting from income tax examinations however the final outcome of tax examinations including the total amount payable or the timing of any such payments upon resolution of these issues cannot be estimated with certainty in addition we cannot be certain that such amount will not be materially different from the amount that is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals for other taxes should the irs or other tax authorities assess additional taxes penalties or interest as a result of a current or a future examination we may be required to record charges to operations in future periods that could have a material impact on our results of operations financial position or cash flows in the applicable period or periods 

forecasts of our annual effective tax rate are complex and subject to uncertainty because our income tax position for each year combines the effects of estimating our annual income or loss the mix of profits and losses earned by us and our subsidiaries in tax jurisdictions with a broad range of income tax rates as well as benefits from available deferred tax assets the impact of various accounting rules our interpretations of changes in tax laws and results of tax audits forecasts of our annual effective tax rate do not include the anticipation of future tax law changes in addition we account for certain tax benefits from stockbased compensation in the period the stock compensation is settled which may cause increased variability in our quarterly effective tax rates if there were a material difference between forecasted and actual tax rates it could have a material impact on our results of operations 

tax laws regulations and compliance practices are evolving and may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flows and financial position 

the us tax cuts and jobs act the “tax act” was enacted in december 2017 and significantly affected us tax law by changing how the us imposes income tax on multinational corporations the us department of treasury has broad authority to issue regulations and interpretative guidance that may significantly impact how we will apply the law and impact our results of operations 

the tax act requires complex computations not previously required by us tax law as such the application of certain accounting guidance is currently evolving further compliance with the tax act and the accounting for certain provisions require accumulation of information not previously required or regularly produced as a result we have provided a provisional estimate on the effect of the tax act in our financial statements as additional interpretative guidance is issued by the applicable authorities we will continue our analysis on the application of the tax act and will revise our current estimates in future periods the revisions to our current estimates could materially affect our results of operations cash flow and financial position for further discussion regarding our income taxes please refer to part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” under the heading “new accounting standards” and note 6 in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

 tax laws regulations and administrative practices in various jurisdictions are evolving and may be subject to significant changes due to economic political and other conditions there are many transactions that occur during the ordinary course of business for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain and significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our provision and accruals for these taxes governments are increasingly focused on ways to increase tax revenues particularly from multinational corporations which may lead to an increase in audit activity and harsher positions taken by tax authorities we are currently subject to tax audits in various jurisdictions including germany india israel and certain states within the united states and these jurisdictions may assess additional tax liabilities against us 

the organisation for economic cooperation and development “oecd” an international association of 34 countries including the united states released the final reports from its base erosion and profit shifting “beps” action plans which aim to standardize and modernize global tax policies the beps action plans propose revisions to numerous tax rules including countrybycountry reporting permanent establishment hybrid entities and instruments transfer pricing and tax treaties the beps action plans have been or are being enacted by countries where we have operations the european commission “ec” has conducted investigations in multiple countries focusing on whether local country tax rulings provide preferential tax treatment that violates european union state aid rules and concluded that certain countries including ireland have provided illegal state aid in certain cases the ec and oecd have also been evaluating new rules on the taxation of the digital economy companies in addition taiwan italy and the united kingdom have recently introduced new rulings or proposals to tax digital transactions these developments in tax laws and regulations and compliance with these rules could have a material adverse effect on our operating results financial position and cash flows 

our stock price has been subject to fluctuations and may continue to be subject to fluctuations 

the market price of our common stock has experienced fluctuations and may fluctuate or decline in the future and as a result you could lose the value of your investment the market price of our common stock may be affected by a number of factors including 



 in addition equity markets in general and the equities of technology companies in particular have experienced and may experience in the future extreme price and volume fluctuations due to among other factors the actions of market participants or other actions outside of our control such price and volume fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock for reasons unrelated to our business or operating results 

our future revenue is dependent in part upon our installed customer base continuing to license or buy products and purchase services 

our installed customer base has traditionally generated additional new license service and maintenance revenues in future periods customers may not necessarily license or buy additional products or contract for additional services or maintenance our customers many of which are large semiconductor and systems companies often have significant bargaining power in negotiations with us customer consolidation can reduce the total level of purchases of our software hardware ip and services and in some cases increase customers’ bargaining power in negotiations with their suppliers including us 

we could suffer serious harm to our business because of the infringement of our intellectual property rights by third parties or because of our infringement of the intellectual property rights of third parties 

there are numerous patents relating to our business and ecosystem new patents are being issued at a rapid rate and are owned by eda companies as well as entities and individuals outside the eda industry including parties whose income is primarily derived from infringementrelated licensing and litigation it is not always practicable to determine in advance whether a product or any of its components infringes the patent rights of others as a result from time to time we may be compelled to respond to or prosecute intellectual property infringement claims to protect our rights or defend a customer’s rights 

intellectual property infringement claims including contractual defense reimbursement obligations related to thirdparty claims against our customers regardless of merit could consume valuable management time result in costly litigation or cause product shipment delays all of which could seriously harm our business operating results or financial condition the risk of infringement and related indemnification claims associated with design ip products that are incorporated into a customer product broadly used by consumers may be higher than the risk associated with our software products in settling these claims we may be required to enter into royalty or licensing agreements with the third parties claiming infringement these royalty or licensing agreements if available may not have terms favorable to us being compelled to enter into a license agreement with unfavorable terms could seriously harm our business operating results or financial condition any potential intellectual property litigation could compel us to do one or more of the following 

 if we were compelled to take any of these actions our business or operating results may suffer 

if our security measures are breached and an unauthorized party obtains access to customer data financial data or assets or our proprietary business information our information systems may be perceived as being unsecure which could harm our business and reputation 

our products and services involve the storage and transmission of our proprietary information and that of our customers we have offices throughout the world including key research and development facilities outside of the united states our operations are dependent upon the connectivity of our operations throughout the world despite our security measures our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to cyber attacks by unauthorized third parties which may include nationstates and individuals sponsored by them or breaches due to employee error malfeasance or other disruptions which could result in unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information and could significantly interfere with our business operations computer hackers may attempt to gain unauthorized access through a variety of methods such as the use of viruses malware ransomware phishing denial of service attacks and other cyber attacks and corrupt the processes of the products and services that we provide we may also be a target of malicious attackers who attempt to gain access to our network or data centers or those of our customers or end users steal proprietary information related to our business products services or infrastructure steal financial data or assets or interrupt our systems and services or those of our customers or others breaches of our security measures could expose us to a risk of loss or misuse of this information loss of financial assets litigation and potential liability because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage information systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventive measures in addition if we select a vendor that uses cyber storage of information as part of their service or product offerings despite our attempts to validate the security of such services our proprietary information may be misappropriated by third parties in the event of an actual or perceived breach of our security or the security of one of our vendors the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed and we could suffer damage to our reputation or our business or lose existing customers and our ability to obtain new customers or suffer harm to our financial condition 

risks associated with our international operations could adversely impact our financial condition 

a significant amount of our revenue is derived from our international operations and we have offices throughout the world including key research and development facilities outside of the united states our international operations may be subject to a number of risks including 

 some of our international research and development and other facilities are in parts of the world where there may be a greater risk of business interruption as a result of political instability terrorist acts or military conflicts than businesses located domestically furthermore this potential harm is exacerbated because damage to or disruptions at our international research and development facilities could have a more significant adverse effect on our ability to develop new or improve existing products than other businesses that may only have sales offices or other less critical operations abroad we are not insured for losses or interruptions caused by acts of war furthermore our operations are dependent upon the connectivity of our operations throughout the world activities that interfere with our international connectivity or operations such as cyber hacking the introduction of a virus into our computer systems natural disasters civil unrest or terrorism could significantly interfere with our business operations 

in addition internal controls policies and procedures and employee training and compliance programs that we have implemented to deter prohibited practices may not prevent our employees contractors or agents from violating or circumventing our policies and the laws and regulations applicable to our worldwide operations 

we depend upon our management team and key employees and our failure to attract train motivate and retain management and key employees may make us less competitive and therefore harm our results of operations 

our business depends upon the continued services efforts and abilities of our senior management and other key employees competition for highly skilled executive officers and employees can be intense particularly in geographic areas recognized as high technology centers such as the silicon valley area where our principal offices are located and in other locations where we maintain facilities in addition competition for qualified personnel including software engineers in the eda commercial electronics engineering services and ip industries has intensified further increased uncertainty regarding social political and immigration policies in the united states and abroad may make it difficult to recruit employees with adequate experience we may also experience increased compensation costs that are not offset by either improved productivity or higher sales we may not be successful in recruiting new personnel and in retaining and motivating existing personnel from time to time there may be changes in our management team resulting from the hiring and departure of executive officers and as a result we may experience disruption to our business that may harm our operating results and our relationships with our employees customers and suppliers may be adversely affected 

to attract retain and motivate individuals with the requisite expertise we may be required to grant large numbers of stock options or other stockbased incentive awards which may be dilutive to existing stockholders and increase compensation expense and pay significant base salaries and cash bonuses which could harm our operating results the high cost of training new employees not fully utilizing these employees or losing trained employees to competing employers could also reduce our operating margins and harm our business or operating results 

in addition applicable rules and regulations require stockholder approval for new equity compensation plans and significant amendments to existing equity compensation plans including increases in shares available for issuance under such plans and prohibit publiclytraded companies from giving a proxy to vote on equity compensation plans unless the beneficial owner of the shares has given voting instructions these rules and regulations could make it more difficult for us to grant equity compensation to employees in the future to the extent that these regulations make it more difficult or expensive to grant equity compensation to employees we may incur increased compensation costs or find it difficult to attract retain and motivate employees which could materially and adversely affect our business 

we rely on our proprietary technology as well as software and other intellectual property rights licensed to us by third parties and we cannot assure you that the precautions taken to protect our rights will be adequate or that we will continue to be able to adequately secure such intellectual property rights from third parties 

our success depends in part upon our proprietary technology we generally rely on patents copyrights trademarks trade secrets licenses and restrictive agreements to establish and protect our proprietary rights in technology and products despite the precautions we may take to protect our intellectual property third parties have tried in the past and may try in the future to challenge invalidate or circumvent these safeguards our patents and other intellectual property rights may not provide us with sufficient competitive advantages patents may not be issued on any of our pending applications and our issued patents may not be sufficiently broad to protect our technology furthermore the laws of foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights in those countries to the same extent as applicable law protects these rights in the united states the protection of our intellectual property may require the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources moreover the steps we take to protect our intellectual property may not adequately protect our rights or deter or prevent third parties from infringing or misappropriating our proprietary rights 

many of our products include software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties we may have to seek new or renew existing licenses for such software and other intellectual property in the future our engineering services business holds licenses to certain software and other intellectual property owned by third parties including that of our competitors our failure to obtain software other intellectual property licenses or other intellectual property rights that are necessary or helpful for our business on favorable terms or our need to engage in litigation over these licenses or rights could seriously harm our business operating results or financial condition 

we have substantial cash requirements in the united states but a significant portion of our cash is held and generated outside of the united states and if our cash available in the united states and the cash available under our revolving credit facility are insufficient to meet our operating expenses and debt repayment obligations in the united states then we may be required to raise cash in ways that could negatively affect our financial condition results of operations and the market price of our common stock 

we have significant operations outside the united states as of december 30 2017  approximately 80  of our cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments balance was held by subsidiaries outside the united states with the remainder of the balance held by us or our subsidiaries in the united states we believe that the combination of our us cash cash equivalents future us operating cash flows cash available under our revolving credit facility and other cash that may be accessible to us on attractive terms are sufficient to meet our ongoing us operating expenses and debt repayment obligations while the tax act may have reduced the tax impact of repatriation of foreign earnings there are still administrative processes associated with repatriation of foreign earnings that could affect the timing of returning cash to the us from nonus jurisdictions accordingly if our us cash were insufficient to meet our future funding obligations in the united states we could be required to seek funding sources on less attractive terms which could negatively impact our results of operations financial position and the market price of our common stock 

litigation could adversely affect our financial condition or operations 

we currently are and in the future may be involved in various disputes and litigation that arise in the ordinary course of business these include disputes and lawsuits related to intellectual property including customer indemnification mergers and acquisitions licensing contracts distribution arrangements and employee relations matters for information regarding the litigation matters in which we are currently engaged please refer to the discussion under part i item 3 “legal proceedings” and note 11 in the notes to consolidated financial statements we cannot provide any assurances that the final outcome of these lawsuits or any other proceedings that may arise in the future will not have a material adverse effect on our business operating results financial condition or cash flows litigation can be time consuming and expensive and could divert management’s time and attention from our business which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and operating results 

errors or defects in our products and services could expose us to liability and harm our business 

our customers use our products and services in designing and developing products that involve a high degree of technological complexity each of which has its own specifications because of the complexity of the systems and products with which we work some of our products and designs can be adequately tested only when put to full use in the marketplace as a result our customers or their end users may discover errors or defects in our software or the systems we design or the products or systems incorporating our design and intellectual property may not operate as expected errors or defects could result in 

 our operating results and revenue could be adversely affected by customer payment delays customer bankruptcies and defaults or modifications of licenses 

occasionally our customers file for bankruptcy or request to modify license terms if our customers experience adversity in their business they may delay or default on their payment obligations to us file for bankruptcy or modify or cancel plans to license our products for instance if our customers are not successful in generating sufficient cash or are precluded from securing financing they may not be able to pay or may delay payment of accounts receivable that are owed to us although these obligations are generally not cancelable our customers’ inability to fulfill payment obligations in turn may adversely affect our revenue and cash flow additionally our customers have in the past sought and may in the future seek to renegotiate preexisting contractual commitments payment defaults by our customers or significant reductions in existing contractual commitments could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results 

the long sales cycle of our products and services may cause our operating results to fluctuate unexpectedly 

generally we have a long sales cycle that can extend up to six months or longer the complexity and expense associated with our products and services generally require a lengthy customer education evaluation and approval process consequently we may incur substantial expenses and devote significant management effort and expense to develop potential relationships that do not result in agreements or revenue and may prevent us from pursuing other opportunities 

in addition sales of our products and services have been and may in the future be delayed if customers delay approval or commencement of projects because of 

 long sales cycles for hardware products subject us to a number of significant risks over which we have limited control including insufficient excess or obsolete inventory variations in inventory valuation and fluctuations in quarterly operating results 

our reported financial results may be adversely affected by changes in united states generally accepted accounting principles and we may incur significant costs to adjust our accounting systems and processes to comply with significant changes 

united states generally accepted accounting principles “us gaap” are subject to interpretation by the financial accounting standards board “fasb” the sec and various bodies formed to promulgate and interpret appropriate accounting principles we are also subject to evolving rules and regulations of the countries in which we do business changes to accounting standards may result in different accounting principles under us gaap that could have a significant effect on our reported financial results for us in areas including but not limited to principles for recognizing revenue and accounting for leases for information regarding new accounting standards please refer to part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” under the heading “new accounting standards” 

in addition we have in the past and may in the future need to significantly change our customer contracts accounting systems and processes when we adopt future or proposed changes in accounting principles noted above the cost and effect of these changes may negatively impact our results of operations during the periods of transition 

our restructuring plans may not result in the benefits we have anticipated possibly having a negative effect on our future operating results 

in recent fiscal years we have initiated restructuring plans in an effort to reallocate or decrease costs by reducing our workforce and by consolidating facilities we incur substantial costs to implement restructuring plans and our restructuring activities may subject us to litigation risks and expenses our past restructuring plans do not provide any assurance that additional restructuring plans will not be required or implemented in the future in addition our restructuring plans may have other consequences such as attrition beyond our planned reduction in workforce a negative effect on employee morale and productivity or our ability to attract highly skilled employees our competitors may also use our restructuring plans to seek to gain a competitive advantage over us as a result our restructuring plans may affect our revenue and other operating results in the future 

we depend on sole suppliers for certain hardware components and contract manufacturers for production of our emulation and prototyping hardware products making us vulnerable to supply disruption and price fluctuation 

we depend on sole suppliers for certain hardware components and contract manufacturers for production of our emulation and prototyping hardware products our reliance on sole suppliers and contract manufacturers could result in product delivery problems and delays and reduced control over product pricing and quality though we prefer to have multiple sources to procure certain key components in some cases it is not practical or feasible to do so we may suffer a disruption in the supply of certain hardware components if we are unable to purchase sufficient components on a timely basis or at all for any reason any supply or manufacturing disruption including delay in delivery of components by our suppliers or products by our manufacturers or the bankruptcy or shutdown of our suppliers or manufacturers could delay our production process and prevent us from delivering completed hardware products to customers or from supplying new evaluation units to customers which could have a negative impact on our revenue and operating results 

failure to obtain export licenses could harm our business by rendering us unable to ship products and transfer our technology outside of the united states 

we must comply with regulations of the united states and of certain other countries in shipping our products and transferring our technology outside the united states and to foreign nationals any significant future difficulty in complying with these regulations could harm our business operating results or financial condition 

if we become subject to unfair hiring claims we could be prevented from hiring needed employees incur liability for damages and incur substantial costs in defending ourselves 

when companies in our industry lose employees to competitors they frequently claim that these competitors have engaged in unfair hiring practices or that the employment of these persons would involve the disclosure or use of trade secrets these claims could prevent us from hiring employees or cause us to incur liability for damages we could also incur substantial costs in defending ourselves or our employees against these claims regardless of their merits defending ourselves from these claims could also divert the attention of our management away from our operations 

antitakeover defenses in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and certain provisions under delaware law could prevent an acquisition of our company or limit the price that investors might be willing to pay for our common stock 

our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and certain provisions of the delaware general corporation law that apply to us could make it difficult for another company to acquire control of our company for example 

 all or any one of these factors could limit the price that certain investors would be willing to pay for shares of our common stock and could allow our board of directors to resist delay or prevent an acquisition of our company even if a proposed transaction were favored by a majority of our independent stockholders 

the investment of our cash is subject to risks that may cause losses and affect the liquidity of these investments 

our investments include various money market funds and may include other investments as well weakened financial markets have at times adversely impacted the general credit liquidity market prices and interest rates for these and other types of investments additionally changes in monetary policy by the federal open market committee or other relevant regulators and concerns about the rising us government debt level may cause a decrease in the purchasing power of the us dollar and adversely affect our investment portfolio the financial market and monetary risks associated with our investment portfolio may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition liquidity results of operations or cash flows 

we are subject to evolving corporate governance and public disclosure regulations that impact compliance costs and risks of noncompliance 

we are subject to changing rules and regulations promulgated by a number of governmental and selfregulatory organizations including the sec nasdaq and the fasb these rules and regulations continue to evolve in scope and complexity and many new requirements have been created in response to laws enacted by the us and foreign governments making compliance more difficult and uncertain the increase in costs to comply with such evolving rules and regulations as well as any risk of noncompliance could adversely impact us 

conflict minerals regulations may cause us to continue to incur additional expenses and may adversely impact our ability to conduct our business 

in august 2012 the sec adopted new rules establishing disclosure and reporting requirements regarding the use of certain minerals referred to as “conflict minerals” in products these rules require us to determine disclose and report whether or not such minerals in our products originate from the democratic republic of the congo or adjoining countries we have incurred and expect to continue to incur costs to comply with these rules including costs associated with conducting due diligence on our supply chain and fulfilling our reporting requirements and we may incur costs related to changes to our products processes or sources of supply in addition these rules could affect the availability of certain minerals used in the manufacture of our emulation and prototyping hardware products and ip boards the “covered products” and thus impact our ability to source at competitive prices certain materials that are used in the covered products finally our customers may prefer to purchase products from vendors who claim that all minerals in their products are conflictfree and our revenues may be harmed or we may face reputational challenges if we are unable to verify that our covered products are conflictfree 

our business is subject to the risk of earthquakes and other natural disasters 

our corporate headquarters including certain of our research and development operations and certain of our distribution facilities is located in the silicon valley area of northern california a region known to experience seismic activity if significant seismic activity were to occur our operations may be interrupted which could adversely impact our business and results of operations 

our other offices in the united states and in other countries around the world may be adversely impacted by natural disasters if a natural disaster occurs at or near any of our offices our operations may be interrupted which could adversely impact our business and results of operations if a natural disaster impacts a significant number of our customers our business and results of operations could be adversely impacted 

risks related to our securities and indebtedness 

our debt obligations expose us to risks that could adversely affect our business operating results or financial condition and could prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under such indebtedness 

as of december 30 2017  we had total outstanding indebtedness of 7294 million  we also had the ability to borrow an additional 2650 million  under our revolving credit facility with the right to request increased capacity up to an additional 2500 million  upon the receipt of lender commitments for total maximum borrowings of 6000 million  under our revolving credit facility subject to the limits contained in the credit agreement governing our revolving credit facility the indenture that governs the 4375 senior notes due 2024 the “2024 notes” and our other debt instruments we may be able to incur substantial additional debt from time to time to finance working capital capital expenditures investments or acquisitions share repurchases or for other purposes if we do so the risks related to our high level of debt could intensify specifically our high level of debt could have important consequences including the following 

 acquisitions or other general corporate requirements 

 purposes thereby reducing the amount of cash flows available for working capital capital expenditures 

acquisitions and other general corporate purposes 

 our revolving credit facility are at variable rates of interest 

 at the option of the holders of our outstanding notes we may under certain circumstances be required to repurchase such notes 

under the terms of our 2024 notes we may be required to repurchase for cash such notes prior to their maturity in connection with the occurrence of certain significant corporate events specifically we are required to offer to repurchase such notes upon a “change of control triggering event” as defined in the indenture related to such notes such as a change of control accompanied by certain downgrades in the credit ratings of such notes the repayment obligations under such notes may have the effect of discouraging delaying or preventing a takeover of our company if we were required to pay the 2024 notes prior to their scheduled maturity it could have a significant negative impact on our cash and liquidity and could impact our ability to invest financial resources in other strategic initiatives 

the terms of the agreements governing our revolving credit facility and 2019 term loan and the indenture governing our 2024 notes restrict our current and future operations particularly our ability to respond to changes or to take certain actions 

the agreements governing our revolving credit facility and 2019 term loan contain a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and may limit our ability to engage in acts that may be in our longterm best interest including restrictions on our ability to 



 in addition the restrictive covenants in the agreements governing our revolving credit facility and 2019 term loan require us to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy other financial condition tests our ability to meet those financial ratios and tests can be affected by events beyond our control and we may be unable to meet them 

a breach of the covenants or restrictions under the agreements governing our revolving credit facility and 2019 term loan could result in an event of default under the applicable indebtedness such a default may allow the creditors to accelerate the related debt and may result in the acceleration of any other debt to which a crossacceleration or crossdefault provision applies in addition an event of default under the credit agreement governing our revolving credit facility would permit the lenders under our revolving credit facility to terminate all commitments to extend further credit under that facility in the event our lenders or note holders accelerate the repayment of our borrowings we and our subsidiaries may not have sufficient assets to repay that indebtedness as a result of these restrictions we may be 

 the indenture governing our 2024 notes also contains certain restrictive covenants that impose operating and financial restrictions on us and may limit our ability to engage in acts that may be in our longterm best interest including restrictions on our ability to incur liens and to enter into sale and leaseback transactions 

these restrictions may affect our ability to grow in accordance with our strategy in addition our financial results our substantial indebtedness and our credit ratings could adversely affect the availability and terms of our financing 

we may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness which may not be successful 

our ability to make scheduled payments on or refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial condition and operating performance which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial business legislative regulatory and other factors beyond our control we may be unable to maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal premium if any and interest on our indebtedness 

if our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations we could face substantial liquidity problems and could be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures or to dispose of material assets or operations seek additional debt or equity capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness we may not be able to effect any such alternative measures if necessary on commercially reasonable terms or at all and even if successful those alternative actions may not allow us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations the agreements governing our revolving credit facility and 2019 term loan restrict our ability to dispose of assets and use the proceeds from those dispositions and may also restrict our ability to raise debt or equity capital to be used to repay other indebtedness when it becomes due we may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain proceeds in an amount sufficient to meet any debt service obligations then due 

in addition we conduct a substantial portion of our operations through our subsidiaries none of which are currently guarantors of our indebtedness accordingly repayment of our indebtedness is dependent on the generation of cash flow by our subsidiaries and their ability to make such cash available to us by dividend debt repayment or otherwise unless they become guarantors of our indebtedness our subsidiaries do not have any obligation to pay amounts due on our indebtedness or to make funds available for that purpose our subsidiaries may not be able to or may not be permitted to make distributions to enable us to make payments in respect of our indebtedness each subsidiary is a distinct legal entity and under certain circumstances legal and contractual restrictions may limit our ability to obtain cash from our subsidiaries while the agreements governing our revolving credit facility and 2019 term loan limit the ability of our subsidiaries to incur consensual restrictions on their ability to pay dividends or make other intercompany payments to us these limitations are subject to qualifications and exceptions in the event that we do not receive distributions from our subsidiaries we may be unable to make required principal and interest payments on our indebtedness 

our inability to generate sufficient cash flows to satisfy our debt obligations or to refinance our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all would materially and adversely affect our financial position and results of operations and our ability to satisfy our debt obligations 

if we cannot make scheduled payments on our debt we will be in default and holders of our debt could declare all outstanding principal and interest to be due and payable the lenders under our revolving credit facility could terminate their commitments to loan money and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation in addition a material default on our indebtedness could suspend our eligibility to register securities using certain registration statement forms under sec guidelines that permit incorporation by reference of substantial information regarding us potentially hindering our ability to raise capital through the issuance of our securities and increasing our costs of registration 

despite our current level of indebtedness we and our subsidiaries may incur substantially more debt this could further exacerbate the risks to our financial condition described above 

we and our subsidiaries may incur significant additional indebtedness in the future although the agreements governing our revolving credit facility and 2019 term loan contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions and the additional indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial if we incur any additional indebtedness that ranks equally with the 2024 notes then subject to any collateral arrangements we may enter into the holders of that debt will be entitled to share ratably in any proceeds distributed in connection with any insolvency liquidation reorganization dissolution or other winding up of our company 

our variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly 

borrowings under our revolving credit facility and 2019 term loan are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk if interest rates were to increase our debt service obligations on our variable rate indebtedness would increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same and our net income and cash flows including cash available for servicing our indebtedness would correspondingly decrease assuming all loans were fully drawn we were to fully exercise our right to increase borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility and we made no prepayments on our 2019 term loan each quarter point change in interest rates would result in a 23 million  change in annual interest expense on our indebtedness under our revolving credit facility and 2019 term loan in the future we may enter into interest rate swaps that involve the exchange of floating for fixed rate interest payments in order to reduce interest rate volatility however we may not maintain interest rate swaps with respect to all of our variable rate indebtedness and any swaps we enter into may not fully mitigate our interest rate risk 

various factors could increase our future borrowing costs or reduce our access to capital including a lowering or withdrawal of the ratings assigned to our 2024 notes by rating agencies 

we may in the future seek additional financing for a variety of reasons and our future borrowing costs and access to capital could be affected by factors including the condition of the debt and equity markets the condition of the economy generally prevailing interest rates our level of indebtedness and our business and financial condition in addition the 2024 notes currently have an investment grade rating and any rating assigned could be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if in that rating agency’s judgment future circumstances relating to the basis of the rating such as adverse changes so warrant consequently real or anticipated changes in our credit ratings will generally affect the market value of the 2024 notes any future lowering of the ratings of the 2024 notes likely would make it more difficult or more expensive for us to obtain additional debt financing

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

  

the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k and with part i item 1a “risk factors” please refer to the cautionary language at the beginning of part i of this annual report on form 10k regarding forwardlooking statements 

business overview 

we continue to focus on executing our system design enablement strategy to deliver the tools necessary for our customers to develop complete and functional electronic products our growing core electronic design automation business is at the heart of our strategy and is complemented by our business in intellectual property system interconnect and analysis system level design and hardwaresoftware development 

our business serves customers that are driven by enduser demand for electronics systems integrated circuits and devices that are smaller use less power and provide more functionality we must keep pace with our customers’ technical developments satisfy industry standards and meet our customers’ increasingly demanding performance productivity quality and predictability requirements we offer innovative solutions to help our customers meet these demands and our future performance depends on our ability to innovate commercialize newly developed solutions and enhance and maintain our current products our acquisitions may increase the speed at which we can deliver innovative solutions to our customers 

we have identified certain items that management uses as performance indicators to manage our business including revenue certain elements of operating expenses and cash flow from operations and we describe these items further below under the headings “results of operations” and “liquidity and capital resources” 

results of operations 

financial results for fiscal 2017  as compared to fiscal 2016  and 2015  reflect the following 

 our fiscal years are 52 or 53week periods ending on the saturday closest to december 31 fiscal 2017 2016 and 2015 were each 52week fiscal years 

revenue 

we primarily generate revenue from licensing our software and ip selling or leasing our emulation and prototyping hardware technology providing maintenance for our software hardware and ip providing engineering services and earning royalties generated from the use of our ip the timing of our revenue is significantly affected by the mix of software hardware and ip products generating revenue in any given period and whether the revenue is recognized over multiple periods or up front upon completion of delivery our revenue may also be affected by our ability to bring to market newly developed or acquired technology during fiscal 2017 we acquired technology that is not expected to generate significant incremental revenue during fiscal 2018 for an additional description of our acquisitions see note 7 in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

 approximately 90 of our revenue is recognized over time and the remainder of the resulting revenue is recognized up front upon completion of delivery revenue recognized over time includes revenue from our timebased software arrangements certain ip license arrangements where revenue is recognized over multiple periods services royalties from certain ip arrangements maintenance on perpetual software licenses and hardware and operating leases of hardware upfront revenue is primarily generated by our sales of emulation and prototyping hardware and perpetual software and certain ip licenses our ability to maintain this mix in any single fiscal period may be impacted primarily by delivery of hardware and ip products to our customers for an additional description of the impact of emulation hardware sales on the timing of revenue recognition see the discussion under the heading “critical accounting estimates – revenue recognition” 

beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 we will recognize revenue based on the revenue recognition requirements of accounting standards update “asu” 201409 “revenue from contracts with customers topic 606” under the new standard we will continue to recognize revenue over time for our software arrangements and the timing of revenue recognition for our hardware and professional services is expected to remain substantially unchanged for additional information on the impact the new accounting standard will have on our revenue see the discussion under the heading “new accounting standards” 

 we believe our reported revenue and the amount of revenue recognized in future periods will depend on among other things the 

 revenue by year 

the following table shows our revenue for fiscal 2017  2016  and 2015  and the change in revenue between years 



product and maintenance revenue increased during fiscal 2017  as compared to fiscal 2016  primarily because of growth in our software and ip businesses partially offset by lower revenue from emulation and prototyping hardware product and maintenance revenue increased during fiscal 2016  as compared to fiscal 2015  primarily because of an increase in revenue from our palladium z1 enterprise emulation system and our digital ic product offerings offset by a reduction in revenue from our ip offerings 

services revenue may fluctuate from period to period based on demand for and our available resources to fulfill our services and ip offerings 

no one customer accounted for 10  or more of total revenue during fiscal 2017  2016  or 2015  

revenue by product group 

the following table shows the percentage of product and related maintenance revenue contributed by each of our five product groups and services during fiscal 2017  2016  and 2015  



revenue by product group fluctuates from period to period based on demand for and our available resources to deliver and support our products and services as described in note 2 in the notes to consolidated financial statements certain of our licensing arrangements allow customers the ability to remix among software products additionally we have arrangements with customers that include a combination of our products with the actual product selection and number of licensed users to be determined at a later date for these arrangements we estimate the allocation of the revenue to product groups based upon the expected usage of our products the actual usage of our products by these customers may differ and if that proves to be the case the revenue allocation in the table above would differ 

  revenue by geography 



revenue for the united states decreased during fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016 primarily due to lower revenue from emulation and prototyping hardware and services partially offset by growth in revenue from software and ip for the primary factors contributing to the increase in revenue for other americas asia and europe middle east and africa and japan during fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016 see the general description under “revenue by year” above 

for the primary factors contributing to the increase in revenue for the united states other americas asia and europe middle east and africa during fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015 see the general description under “revenue by year” above revenue for japan decreased during fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015 primarily due to difficult business conditions facing our japanese customers 

revenue by geography as a percent of total revenue 



revenue by geography fluctuates from period to period based on demand for and our available resources to deliver and support our products and services 

most of our revenue is transacted in the united states dollar however certain revenue transactions are denominated in foreign currencies for an additional description of how changes in foreign exchange rates affect our consolidated financial statements see the discussion under item 7a “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk – foreign currency risk” 

cost of revenue 

  

the following table shows cost of revenue as a percentage of related revenue for fiscal 2017  2016  and 2015  

  



cost of product and maintenance 

cost of product and maintenance includes costs associated with the sale and lease of our emulation and prototyping hardware and licensing of our software and ip products certain employee salary and benefits and other employeerelated costs cost of our customer support services amortization of technologyrelated and maintenancerelated acquired intangibles costs of technical documentation and royalties payable to thirdparty vendors costs associated with our emulation and prototyping hardware products include materials assembly testing applicable reserves and overhead these hardware manufacturing costs make our cost of emulation and prototyping hardware products higher as a percentage of revenue than our cost of software and ip products 

a summary of cost of product and maintenance for fiscal 2017  2016  and 2015  is as follows 

  

cost of product and maintenance depends primarily on our hardware product sales in any given period cost of product and maintenance is also affected by employee salary and benefits and other employeerelated costs as well as the timing and extent to which we acquire intangible assets acquire or license thirdparties’ intellectual property or technology and sell our products that include such acquired or licensed intellectual property or technology 

the changes in product and maintenancerelated costs were due to the following 



costs of emulation and prototyping hardware decreased during fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016 primarily due to lower revenue for emulation and prototyping hardware gross margins on our hardware products will fluctuate based on product life cycle product competition product mix and pricing strategies emulation and prototyping hardware costs increased during fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015 primarily due to higher emulation hardware volume and an increase in charges for reserves on inventory during fiscal 2016 as we approached the end of the product life cycle of palladium xp a previous generation of our palladium hardware platform 

cost of services 

cost of services primarily includes employee salary benefits and other employeerelated costs to perform work on revenuegenerating projects costs to maintain the infrastructure necessary to manage a services organization and provisions for contract losses if any cost of services will fluctuate from period to period based on our utilization of design services engineers on revenuegenerating projects or on internal development projects cost of services increased during fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016 and decreased during fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015 primarily due to variation in the number of personnel dedicated to deliver and support our services and custom ip offerings 

  operating expenses 

our operating expenses include marketing and sales research and development and general and administrative expenses factors that cause our operating expenses to fluctuate include changes in the number of employees due to hiring and acquisitions restructuring activities foreign exchange rates stockbased compensation and the impact of our variable compensation programs that are driven by overall operating results 

stockbased compensation included in our operating expenses increased during fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016 and during fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015 primarily because successive increases in the price of our common stock have resulted in higher grantdate fair values for the mix of stock awards expensed in each period 

many of our operating expenses are transacted in various foreign currencies we recognize lower expenses in periods when the united states dollar strengthens in value against other currencies and we recognize higher expenses when the united states dollar weakens against other currencies for an additional description of how changes in foreign exchange rates affect our consolidated financial statements see the discussion in item 7a “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk – foreign currency risk” 

our operating expenses for fiscal 2017  2016  and 2015  were as follows 



our operating expenses as a percentage of total revenue for fiscal 2017  2016  and 2015  were as follows 



  

marketing and sales 

the changes in marketing and sales expense were due to the following 



costs included in marketing and sales increased during fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016 primarily due to additional headcount in fiscal 2017 and an increase in incentive compensation costs included in marketing and sales decreased during fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015 primarily due to yearoveryear headcount reductions within our sales organization 

research and development 

  the changes in research and development expense were due to the following 



we must invest significantly in product research and development to keep pace with the latest manufacturing technology the demand for new ic manufacturing technology directly impacts the demand for our newest products and we must keep pace with our customers’ technical developments satisfy industry standards and meet our customers’ increasingly demanding performance productivity quality and predictability requirements costs included in research and development increased during fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016 and during fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015 primarily due to incremental investments in research and development as a result of additional hiring 

general and administrative 

the changes in general and administrative expense were due to the following 



general and administrative costs increased during fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016 primarily due to an increase in accounting and tax services and an increase in employee salaries and benefits general and administrative costs increased during fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015 primarily due to increased headcount and merit adjustments for existing employees and costs associated with our fiscal 2016 acquisitions 

amortization of acquired intangibles 



the changes in amortization of acquired intangibles were due to the following 



restructuring and other charges 

we have initiated several restructuring plans in recent years to better align our resources with our business strategy because the restructuring charges and related benefits are derived from management’s estimates made during the formulation of the restructuring plans based on thencurrently available information our restructuring plans may not achieve the benefits anticipated on the timetable or at the level contemplated demand for our products and services and ultimately our future financial performance is difficult to predict with any degree of certainty accordingly additional actions including further restructuring of our operations may be required in the future 

the following table presents restructuring and other charges credits net for our restructuring plans 



for an additional description of our restructuring plans see note 11 in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

interest expense 

interest expense for fiscal 2017  2016  and 2015  was comprised of the following 



for an additional description of our debt arrangements see note 3 in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

income taxes 

the following table presents the provision for income taxes and the effective tax rate for fiscal 2017  2016  and 2015  



the tax act included several provisions that affected us significantly such as a onetime mandatory transition tax on our previously untaxed foreign earnings the “transition tax” and a reduction in the federal corporation income tax rate to 21 as of january 1 2018 

because the tax act requires complex computations that require accumulation of information not previously required or regularly produced and because certain tax and accounting effects are currently uncertain we were unable to complete our accounting for the tax act in fiscal 2017 we recorded provisional amounts for the changes to the tax law for which a reasonable estimate could be determined if a reasonable estimate could not be made we continued to apply the tax rules in effect prior to the tax act we expect to refine our provisional amounts and to complete our accounting for the tax act during fiscal 2018 as we obtain prepare and analyze additional information that we expect to be available during fiscal 2018 for further discussion regarding our accounting for the tax act see note 6 in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

our provision for income taxes for the fiscal year ended december 30 2017 is primarily attributable to income tax effects of the tax act the provisional amount related to the transition tax was 672 million and the provisional amount related to the remeasurement of our us deferred tax assets and liabilities for the us tax rate reduction was 252 million our provision for income taxes for the fiscal year ended december 30 2017 included 320 million of tax benefit related to stockbased compensation that vested or settled during the period 

our provision for income taxes for the fiscal year ended december 31 2016 is primarily attributable to federal state and foreign income taxes on our fiscal 2016 income and includes the tax benefit resulting from the permanent reinstatement of the united states research tax credit in december 2015 during fiscal 2016 we adopted a new accounting standard related to the accounting for stockbased compensation that requires all income tax effects of stockbased awards to be recognized in our consolidated income statement as the awards vest or are settled we adopted the accounting standard on a prospective basis and prior fiscal periods were not restated our provision for income taxes for the fiscal year ended december 31 2016 includes 172 million of tax benefit related to stockbased compensation that vested or settled during the period 

our provision for income taxes for the fiscal year ended january 2 2016 was primarily attributable to federal state and foreign income taxes on our fiscal 2015 income which was partially offset by 138 million  of tax benefit related to the effective settlement of a tax examination of a foreign subsidiary our provision for income taxes included a tax benefit of 101 million  resulting from the enactment of the united states research tax credit in december 2015 

our future effective tax rates may be materially impacted by tax amounts associated with our foreign earnings at rates different from the united states federal statutory rate research credits the tax impact of stockbased compensation accounting for uncertain tax positions business combinations closure of statutes of limitations or settlement of tax audits changes in valuation allowance and changes in tax law a significant amount of our foreign earnings is generated by our subsidiaries organized in ireland and hungary our future effective tax rates may be adversely affected if our earnings were to be lower in countries where we have lower statutory tax rates we currently expect that our fiscal 2018 effective tax rate will be approximately 13 we expect that our quarterly effective tax rates will vary from our fiscal 2018 effective tax rate as a result of recognizing the income tax effects of stockbased awards in the quarterly periods that the awards vest or are settled and other items that we cannot anticipate we may also revise our fiscal 2018 effective tax rate as a result of further analyzing the implications of the tax act and as we complete the accounting for the tax act for additional discussion about how our effective tax rate could be affected by various risks see part i item 1a “risk factors” for further discussion regarding our income taxes see note 6 in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

 liquidity and capital resources 



cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments 

as of december 30 2017  our principal sources of liquidity consisted of 6925 million  of cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments as compared to 4683 million  as of december 31 2016  

our primary sources of cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments during fiscal 2017  were cash generated from operations proceeds from borrowings under our revolving credit facility proceeds from the exercise of stock options and proceeds from stock purchases under our employee stock purchase plan 

our primary uses of cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments during fiscal 2017  were payments related to salaries and benefits operating expenses acquisitions repurchases of our common stock payments on our revolving credit facility purchases of property plant and equipment and tax payments 

 approximately 80  of our cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments were held by our foreign subsidiaries as of december 30 2017  we expect that current cash cash equivalents and shortterm investment balances cash flows that are generated from operations and cash borrowings available under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to meet our domestic and international working capital needs and other capital and liquidity requirements including acquisitions and share repurchases for at least the next 12 months 

net working capital 

net working capital is comprised of current assets less current liabilities as shown on our consolidated balance sheets the increase in our net working capital as of december 30 2017  as compared to december 31 2016  is primarily due to a net increase in cash and cash equivalents 

cash flows from operating activities 

cash flows from operating activities during fiscal 2017  2016  and 2015  were as follows 



cash flows from operating activities include net income adjusted for certain noncash items as well as changes in the balances of certain assets and liabilities our cash flows from operating activities are significantly influenced by business levels and the payment terms set forth in our customer agreements the increase in cash flows from operating activities during fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015 was primarily due to the timing of cash receipts from customers and disbursements made to vendors and improved profitability 

we expect that cash flows from operating activities will fluctuate in future periods due to a number of factors including our operating results the timing of our billings collections disbursements and tax payments 

cash flows from investing activities 

cash flows provided by used for investing activities during fiscal 2017  2016  and 2015  were as follows 



the increase in cash used for investing activities during fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016 was primarily due to an increase in cash paid for business combinations and a decrease in net proceeds from our investment portfolio the increase in cash flows provided by investing activities during fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015 was primarily due to an increase in proceeds resulting from the sale and maturity of availableforsale securities partially offset by an increase in cash used for business combinations and asset acquisitions 

we expect to continue our investing activities including purchasing property plant and equipment purchasing intangible assets business combinations purchasing software licenses and making longterm equity investments 

cash flows from financing activities 

cash flows used for financing activities during fiscal 2017  2016  and 2015  were as follows 



the decrease in cash used for financing activities during fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016 was primarily due to a decrease in payments made to repurchase shares of our common stock partially offset by a net decrease in proceeds from borrowings the decrease in cash used for financing activities during fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015 was primarily due to proceeds from the 2019 term loan and our revolving credit facility and a decrease in payments made to settle outstanding borrowings offset by an increase in payments made to repurchase shares of our common stock 

other factors affecting liquidity and capital resources 

tax act 

the tax act provides an election to pay the net tax liability for the transition tax in eight annual installments we have currently estimated a provisional net tax liability of approximately 3 million for the transition tax the provisional net tax liability is less than the provisional federal income tax expense for the transition tax primarily because we expect to utilize tax credit carryforwards to reduce our transition tax payable the remeasurement of our deferred tax assets for the us tax rate reduction is a noncash expense we currently do not expect the tax act to otherwise significantly impact the amount of our cash used to pay income taxes in fiscal 2018 however we continue to review the impact of the tax act on our cash taxes 

the tax act provides that we may repatriate earnings from our foreign subsidiaries in fiscal 2018 and future years without additional us federal income taxes we are currently evaluating our plans for our earnings from foreign subsidiaries we currently do not expect to indefinitely reinvest our earnings from our foreign subsidiaries although we continue to assess our plans including the impact of the tax act we are also evaluating our plans for dividends from our foreign subsidiaries in fiscal 2018 

stock repurchase program 

in january 2017 our board of directors authorized the repurchase of shares of our common stock with a value of up to 5250 million  in the aggregate we expect to repurchase approximately 50 million of our common stock during the first quarter of fiscal 2018 the actual timing and amount of future repurchases are subject to business and market conditions corporate and regulatory requirements acquisition opportunities and other factors as of december 30 2017  approximately 425 million  remained available under this authorization see part ii item 5 “market for registrant’s common equity related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities” for additional information 

revolving credit facility 

our senior unsecured revolving credit facility provides for borrowings up to 3500 million  with the right to request increased capacity up to an additional 2500 million  upon the receipt of lender commitments for total maximum borrowings of 6000 million  the credit facility expires on january 28 2022 and currently has no subsidiary guarantors any outstanding loans drawn under the credit facility are due at maturity on january 28 2022 outstanding borrowings may be paid at any time prior to maturity as of december 30 2017  there were 850 million  of borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility 

2019 term loan 

in january 2016 we entered into a 3000 million   three year senior unsecured nonamortizing term loan facility due on january 28 2019  the “2019 term loan” with a group of lenders led by jpmorgan chase bank na as administrative agent the 2019 term loan is unsecured and may be settled at any time if we elect to do so 

2024 notes 

in october 2014 we issued 3500 million  aggregate principal amount of 4375  senior notes due october 15 2024 we received net proceeds of 3424 million  from the issuance of the 2024 notes net of a discount of 14 million  and issuance costs of 62 million  interest is payable in cash semiannually the 2024 notes are unsecured and rank equal in right of payment to all of our existing and future senior indebtedness the proceeds from the 2024 notes are available for general corporate purposes which may include the retirement of debt working capital capital expenditures acquisitions and strategic transactions 

contractual obligations 

a summary of our contractual obligations as of december 30 2017  is as follows 



 



offbalance sheet arrangements 

as of december 30 2017  we did not have any significant offbalance sheet arrangements as defined in item 303a4ii of sec regulation sk 

critical accounting estimates 

in preparing our consolidated financial statements we make assumptions judgments and estimates that can have a significant impact on our revenue operating income and net income as well as on the value of certain assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets we base our assumptions judgments and estimates on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions at least quarterly we evaluate our assumptions judgments and estimates and make changes as deemed necessary 

we believe that the assumptions judgments and estimates involved in the accounting for income taxes revenue recognition and business combinations have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements therefore we consider these to be our critical accounting estimates for information on our significant accounting policies see note 2 in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

accounting for income taxes 

we are subject to income taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our provision for these taxes there are many transactions that occur during the ordinary course of business for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain the tax act has many provisions that require additional guidance on specific interpretations of the tax law changes our provision for income taxes could be adversely affected by our earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries where we have higher statutory rates losses incurred in jurisdictions for which we are not able to realize the related tax benefit changes in foreign currency exchange rates entry into new businesses and geographies and changes to our existing businesses acquisitions and investments changes in our deferred tax assets and liabilities including changes in our assessment of valuation allowances changes in the relevant tax laws or interpretations of these tax laws and developments in current and future tax examinations 

we only recognize the tax benefit of an income tax position if we judge that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained solely on its technical merits in a tax audit including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes to make this judgment we must interpret complex and sometimes ambiguous tax laws regulations and administrative practices if we judge that an income tax position meets this recognition threshold then we must measure the amount of the tax benefit to be recognized by estimating the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50 cumulative probability of being realized upon settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all of the relevant facts it is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts as this requires us to determine the probability of various possible settlement outcomes we must reevaluate our income tax positions on a quarterly basis to consider factors such as changes in facts or circumstances changes in tax law effectively settled issues under audit the lapse of applicable statute of limitations and new audit activity such a change in recognition or measurement would result in recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision for a more detailed description of our unrecognized tax benefits see note 6 in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition 

we begin to recognize revenue when all of the following criteria are met 

 significant judgment is involved in the determination of whether the facts and circumstances of an arrangement support that the fee for the arrangement is considered to be fixed or determinable and that collectibility of the fee is probable and these judgments can affect the amount of revenue that we recognize in a particular reporting period for contracts that do not include a substantial upfront payment we consider a fee to be fixed or determinable if the arrangement has payment periods that are less than or equal to the term of the licenses and the payments are collected in equal or nearly equal installments when evaluated over the entire term of the arrangement if we no longer were to have a history of collecting under the original contract without providing concessions on timebased licenses revenue from such licenses would be required to be recognized when payments under the contract become due and payable such a change could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

we must also make judgments when assessing whether a contract amendment to a timebased arrangement primarily in the context of a license extension or renewal constitutes a concession we have established a history of collecting under contracts for which the fee has been assessed as fixed or determinable without providing concessions on payments products or services 

generally we are able to estimate whether collection is probable but significant judgment is applied as we assess the creditworthiness of our customers to make this determination key external and internal factors are considered in developing our creditworthiness assessment including public information historical and current financial statements and past collection history if our experience were to change it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations if in our judgment collection of a fee is not probable we do not record revenue until the uncertainty is removed which is generally upon receipt of cash payment 

revenue associated with our timebased licenses is recognized over the term of the arrangement commencing upon the later of the effective date of the arrangement or delivery of the first software product in general product revenue associated with perpetual licenses where vendor specific objective evidence “vsoe” exists for the undelivered maintenance is recognized up front upon the later of the effective date of the arrangement or delivery of the software product provided all other conditions for revenue recognition have been met and maintenance revenue is recognized ratably over the maintenance term if certain other criteria are met revenue for design ip is recognized upon delivery and we accrue the expected costs of maintenance a relatively small percentage of our revenue from software and ip licenses is recognized on an upfront basis 

our hardware products generally include the hardware product and its related essential software and maintenance for the hardware and the essential software consideration allocated to the hardware product and the essential software is recognized as revenue at the time of delivery provided all other conditions for revenue recognition have been met consideration allocated to the maintenance is recognized ratably over the maintenance term 

revenue from services and customized ip arrangements is recognized either on the time and materials method as work is performed or on the percentageofcompletion method if a service contract is considered to be part of a multiple element arrangement “mea” that includes a software contract revenue is generally recognized over the duration of the software contract for contracts with fixed or nottoexceed fees we estimate on a monthly basis the percentage of completion based on the completion of milestones relating to the arrangement we have a history of accurately estimating project status and the costs necessary to complete projects a number of internal and external factors can affect our estimates including labor rates utilization and efficiency variances and specification and testing requirement changes if different conditions were to prevail such that accurate estimates could not be made then the use of the completed contract method would be required and the recognition of all revenue and costs would be deferred until the project was completed such a change could have a material impact on our results of operations 

if a group of contracts is so closely related that they are in effect part of a single arrangement such arrangements are deemed to be an mea we exercise significant judgment to evaluate the relevant facts and circumstances in determining whether the separate contracts should be accounted for individually as distinct arrangements or whether the separate contracts are in substance an mea our judgments about whether a group of contracts is an mea can affect the timing of revenue recognition under those contracts which could have an effect on our results of operations for the periods involved for example a perpetual license agreement that would otherwise result in upfront revenue upon delivery may be deemed part of an mea when it is executed within close proximity or in contemplation of other license agreements with the same customer that require revenue recognition over time in which event all the revenue is recognized over the longest term of any component of the mea instead of up front 

for an mea that includes software and nonsoftware elements we allocate consideration to all software elements as a group and all nonsoftware elements based on their relative standalone selling prices revenue allocated to each deliverable is then recognized when all four criteria are met in these circumstances there is a hierarchy to determine the standalone selling price to be used for allocating consideration to the deliverables as follows 

 we calculate the besp of our hardware products based on our pricing practices including the historical average prices charged for comparable hardware products because vsoe or tpe cannot be established our process for determining besp for our software deliverables without vsoe or tpe takes into account multiple factors that vary depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each deliverable key external and internal factors considered in developing the besps include prices charged by us for similar arrangements historical pricing practices and the nature of the product in addition when developing besps we may consider other factors as appropriate including the pricing of competitive alternatives if they exist and productspecific business objectives we exercise significant judgment to evaluate the relevant facts and circumstances in calculating the besp of the deliverables in our arrangements 

business combinations 

when we acquire businesses we allocate the purchase price to the acquired tangible assets and assumed liabilities including deferred revenue liabilities associated with the fair value of contingent consideration and acquired identifiable intangible assets any residual purchase price is recorded as goodwill the allocation of the purchase price requires us to make significant estimates in determining the fair values of these acquired assets and assumed liabilities especially with respect to intangible assets and goodwill these estimates are based on information obtained from management of the acquired companies our assessment of this information and historical experience these estimates can include but are not limited to the cash flows that an acquired business is expected to generate in the future the cash flows that specific assets acquired with that business are expected to generate in the future the appropriate weightedaverage cost of capital and the cost savings expected to be derived from acquiring an asset these estimates are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and if different estimates were used the purchase price for the acquisition could be allocated to the acquired assets and assumed liabilities differently from the allocation that we have made to the acquired assets and assumed liabilities in addition unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that may affect the accuracy or validity of such estimates and if such events occur we may be required to adjust the value allocated to acquired assets or assumed liabilities 

we also make significant judgments and estimates when we assign useful lives to the definitelived intangible assets identified as part of our acquisitions these estimates are inherently uncertain and if we used different estimates the useful life over which we amortize intangible assets would be different in addition unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that may impact the useful life assigned to our intangible assets which would impact our amortization of intangible assets expense and our results of operations 

new accounting standards 

revenue recognition 

in may 2014 the fasb issued asu 201409 “revenue from contracts with customers topic 606” which supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in “revenue recognition topic 605” under topic 606 revenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services and is recognized in an amount that reflects the consideration which the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services in addition topic 606 requires enhanced disclosures including disclosure of the nature amount timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers the fasb has recently issued several amendments to the standard including clarification on accounting for licenses of intellectual property and identifying performance obligations 

topic 606 permits two methods of adoption retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented full retrospective method or modified retrospectively with the cumulative effect of applying the guidance as of the date of initial application the cumulative catchup transition method we will adopt the standard using the cumulative catchup transition method 

topic 606 is effective for us beginning with the first quarter of fiscal 2018 in preparation for adoption of the standard we implemented changes to our processes related to revenue recognition and the control activities within them the most significant impacts of our adoption of topic 606 are as follows 

 we will continue to recognize revenue over time for our timebased software arrangements which represent a large majority of our total revenue because the multiple software licenses and related updates in our timebased arrangements constitute a single combined performance obligation the timing of revenue recognition for our hardware and professional services is expected to remain substantially unchanged 

the adoption of topic 606 will impact our accounting for meas that combine many softwarerelated deliverables which may include multiple software contracts with varying terms ip licenses andor service elements topic 605 requires vsoe to recognize revenue separately for the different undelivered elements we have not established vsoe under topic 605 thus the revenue related to these agreements is generally recognized over time beginning with the delivery of the last specified deliverable and ending on the latest end date topic 606 requires us to separate the different elements through the use of standalone selling prices “ssps” and to recognize the revenue allocated to the different elements as if those elements had been sold on a standalone basis either up front or over time certain ip license agreements will be recognized up front under topic 606 as opposed to over time under topic 605 in addition certain software agreements will be recognized over time under topic 606 as opposed to up front under topic 605 despite these changes we expect our revenue mix will be similar such that approximately 90 of our revenue is recognized over time 

more judgments and estimates are required under topic 606 than are required under topic 605 including estimating the ssp for each performance obligation identified within our contracts due to the complexity of certain contracts the actual revenue recognition treatment required under the new standard for these arrangements may be dependent on contractspecific terms and vary in some instances 

under the cumulative catchup transition method we have evaluated our contracts that were in effect on the adoption date as if they had been accounted for under topic 606 from contract inception some revenue related to the meas and ip arrangements noted above that would have been recognized in future periods under topic 605 will be recast under topic 606 as if the revenue had been recognized in prior periods as this transition method requires that we not adjust historical reported revenue   amounts the revenue that would have been recognized under this method prior to the adoption date will be an adjustment to retained earnings and will not be recognized as revenue in future periods as previously planned because of this transition method approximately 3 of our yearend backlog will be adjusted to retained earnings upon adoption 

topic 606 also requires the deferral of incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer this requires that we capitalize commission costs that are directly related to obtaining customer contracts and amortize them over the life of the contract we anticipate the amount of the amortization of capitalized commissions under topic 606 will be similar to the amount of commissions expense for fiscal 2018 bookings under topic 605 and will not have a significant impact on our consolidated income statements 

financial instruments 

in january 2016 the fasb issued asu 201601 “financial instruments—overall subtopic 82510 recognition and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities” which will impact certain aspects of recognition measurement presentation and disclosure of financial instruments the updated standard becomes effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 upon the effective date of the new standard all equity investments in unconsolidated entities other than those accounted for using the equity method of accounting will generally be measured at fair value with the changes in fair value recognized through earnings there will no longer be an availableforsale classification for equity investments and therefore the changes in the fair value of our marketable equity securities will no longer be reported in other comprehensive income loss 

the updated standard also simplifies the impairment assessment of investments without readily determinable fair values by requiring a qualitative assessment of investments at each reporting period the new guidance must be applied by means of a cumulativeeffect adjustment to the balance sheet as of the beginning of the year of adoption we do not anticipate that the adoption of this standard will have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements or the related disclosures based on our current holdings of equity investments 

leases 

in february 2016 the fasb issued asu 201602 “leases topic 842” requiring among other things the recognition of lease liabilities and corresponding rightofuse assets on the balance sheet by lessees for certain lease arrangements that are classified as operating leases under the previous standard while we are continuing to assess the potential impacts of the standard we anticipate that the adoption of this standard will have a material impact on our consolidated balance sheets and may require changes to our systems and processes we currently expect the most significant impact will be the recognition of rightofuse assets and lease liabilities for operating leases the updated standard will become effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 

income tax 

in october 2016 the fasb issued asu 201616 “income taxes topic 740 intraentity transfers of assets other than inventory” the new guidance requires the recognition of the income tax consequences of an intraentity asset transfer when the transfer occurs for intraentity transfers of inventory the income tax effects will continue to be deferred until the inventory has been sold to a third party the new standard becomes effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 the new guidance must be applied on a modified retrospective basis through a cumulativeeffect adjustment directly to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption we are currently evaluating the effects that the adoption of this guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements we anticipate the potential for increased volatility in future effective tax rates from the adoption of this guidance 

in december 2017 the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 118 “sab 118” regarding the accounting for income taxes in the reporting period that includes the date on which the united states enacted the tax act the tax act significantly changes existing us tax law and includes numerous provisions that will affect businesses us gaap generally requires companies to recognize the effect of tax law changes in the period of enactment sab 118 will allow registrants to record provisional amounts for a period of up to one year from the date of enactment when it does not have the necessary information available prepared or analyzed including computations in reasonable detail to complete its accounting for the changes in tax law this provisional period ends when a company has obtained prepared and analyzed the information necessary to finalize its accounting but cannot extend beyond december 22 2018 because the tax act was passed late in the fourth quarter of 2017 and ongoing guidance and accounting interpretations are expected in the future we consider the accounting of the transition tax deferred tax remeasurement and other items to be incomplete due to the forthcoming guidance and our ongoing analysis of final yearend data and tax positions we expect to refine our provisional amounts and to complete our accounting for the tax act during fiscal 2018 for further discussion see note 6 in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

business combinations 

in january 2017 the fasb issued asu 201701 “business combinations topic 805 clarifying the definition of a business” that revises the definition of a business as it relates to acquisitions disposals goodwill impairments and consolidations the updated standard becomes effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 and early adoption is permitted we do not anticipate that the adoption of this standard will have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements or the related disclosures 

goodwill impairment 

in january 2017 the fasb issued asu 201704 “intangibles—goodwill and other topic 350 simplifying the test for goodwill impairment” that eliminates “step 2” from the goodwill impairment test the new standard will be effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 and early adoption is permitted the new guidance must be applied on a prospective basis we do not anticipate that the adoption of this standard will have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements or the related disclosures 

stockbased compensation 

in may 2017 the fasb issued asu 201709 “compensation—stock compensation topic 718 scope of modification accounting” that provides guidance about which changes to the terms or conditions of a sharebased payment award require an entity to apply modification accounting the new standard is effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 the new guidance must be applied on a prospective basis we do not anticipate that the adoption of this standard will have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements or the related disclosures 

income tax effects within accumulated other comprehensive income 

in february 2018 the fasb issued asu 201802 “reclassification of certain tax effects from accumulated other comprehensive income” that allows a reclassification of the income tax effects of the tax act on items within accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings the new guidance may be applied at the beginning of the period of adoption or retrospectively to each period in which the effect of the change in federal income tax rate from the tax act is recognized the new standard will be effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 and early adoption is permitted we are currently evaluating the effects that the adoption of this guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements and the related disclosures 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

foreign currency risk 

a material portion of our revenue expenses and business activities are transacted in the us dollar in certain foreign countries where we price our products and services in us dollars a decrease in value of the local currency relative to the us dollar results in an increase in the prices for our products and services compared to those products of our competitors that are priced in local currency this could result in our prices being uncompetitive in certain markets 

in certain countries where we may invoice customers in the local currency our revenues benefit from a weaker dollar and are adversely affected by a stronger dollar the opposite impact occurs in countries where we record expenses in local currencies in those cases our costs and expenses benefit from a stronger dollar and are adversely affected by a weaker dollar the fluctuations in our operating expenses outside the united states resulting from volatility in foreign exchange rates are not generally moderated by corresponding fluctuations in revenues from existing contracts 

we enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to protect against currency exchange risks associated with existing assets and liabilities a foreign currency forward exchange contract acts as a hedge by increasing in value when underlying assets decrease in value or underlying liabilities increase in value due to changes in foreign exchange rates conversely a foreign currency forward exchange contract decreases in value when underlying assets increase in value or underlying liabilities decrease in value due to changes in foreign exchange rates these forward contracts are not designated as accounting hedges so the unrealized gains and losses are recognized in other income net in advance of the actual foreign currency cash flows with the fair value of these forward contracts being recorded as accrued liabilities or other current assets 

we do not use forward contracts for trading purposes our forward contracts generally have maturities of 90 days or less we enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts based on estimated future asset and liability exposures and the effectiveness of our hedging program depends on our ability to estimate these future asset and liability exposures recognized gains and losses with respect to our current hedging activities will ultimately depend on how accurately we are able to match the amount of foreign currency forward exchange contracts with actual underlying asset and liability exposures 

the following table provides information about our foreign currency forward exchange contracts as of december 30 2017  the information is provided in united states dollar equivalent amounts the table presents the notional amounts at contract exchange rates and the weighted average contractual foreign currency exchange rates expressed as units of the foreign currency per united states dollar which in some cases may not be the market convention for quoting a particular currency all of these forward contracts matured during january 2018  



we actively monitor our foreign currency risks but there is no guarantee that our foreign currency hedging activities will substantially offset the impact of fluctuations in currency exchange rates on our results of operations cash flows and financial position 

interest rate risk 

our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our portfolio of cash and cash equivalents and balances outstanding on our revolving credit facility if any and our 2019 term loan we are exposed to interest rate fluctuations in many of the world’s leading industrialized countries but our interest income and expense is most sensitive to fluctuations in the general level of united states interest rates in this regard changes in united states interest rates affect the interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents and the costs associated with foreign currency hedges 

all highly liquid securities with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase are considered to be cash equivalents securities with maturities greater than three months are classified as availableforsale and are considered to be shortterm investments the carrying value of our interestbearing instruments approximated fair value as of december 30 2017  

interest rates under our revolving credit facility and 2019 term loan are variable so interest expense could be adversely affected by changes in interest rates particularly for periods when we maintain a balance outstanding under the revolving credit facility interest rates for our revolving credit facility and 2019 term loan can fluctuate based on changes in market interest rates and in an interest rate margin that varies based on our consolidated leverage ratio as of december 30 2017  there were 850 million  borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility for an additional description of the revolving credit facility and 2019 term loan see note 3 in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

equity price risk 

equity investments 

we have a portfolio of equity investments that includes marketable equity securities and nonmarketable investments our equity investments are made primarily in connection with our strategic investment program under our strategic investment program from time to time we make cash investments in companies with technologies that are potentially strategically important to us see note 4 in the notes to consolidated financial statements for an additional description of these investments our nonmarketable investments had a carrying value of 30 million  as of december 30 2017  and 32 million  as of december 31 2016  




 item 9 changes in and disagreements with accountants on accounting and financial disclosure 

none 




 item 9a controls and procedures 

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

as required by rule 13a15 of the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended the “exchange act” under the supervision and with the participation of our management including our chief executive officer “ceo” and our chief financial officer “cfo” we evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rules 13a15e and 15d15e under the exchange act as of december 30 2017  

the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures included a review of our processes and the effect on the information generated for use in this annual report on form 10k in the course of this evaluation we sought to identify any material weaknesses in our disclosure controls and procedures to determine whether we had identified any acts of fraud involving personnel who have a significant role in our disclosure controls and procedures and to confirm that any necessary corrective action including process improvements was taken this type of evaluation is done every fiscal quarter so that our conclusions concerning the effectiveness of these controls can be reported in our periodic reports filed with the sec the overall goals of these evaluation activities are to monitor our disclosure controls and procedures and to make modifications as necessary we intend to maintain these disclosure controls and procedures modifying them as circumstances warrant 

based on their evaluation as of december 30 2017  our ceo and cfo have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by us in our reports filed or submitted under the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the sec’s rules and forms and is accumulated and communicated to our management including the ceo and cfo as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure 

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the fiscal quarter ended december 30 2017  that materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting 

inherent limitations on effectiveness of controls 

our management including our ceo and cfo does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud internal control over financial reporting no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of internal control are met further the design of internal control must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of the control must be considered relative to their costs while our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance of their effectiveness because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within cadence have been detected 

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rule 13a15f under the exchange act our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 30 2017  in making this assessment our management used the criteria established in internal controlintegrated framework 2013 issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission “coso” our management has concluded that as of december 30 2017  our internal control over financial reporting is effective based on these criteria our independent registered public accounting firm kpmg llp has issued an attestation report on our internal control over financial reporting which is included in part iv item 15 “exhibits and financial statement schedules”

overview 

we enable our customers to design electronic products our products and services are designed to give our customers a competitive edge in their development of electronic systems integrated circuits or ics electronic devices and increasingly sophisticated manufactured products by optimizing performance minimizing power consumption shortening the time to bring their products to market and reducing their design development and manufacturing costs our customers create and sell electronic products at differing levels of completeness our electronic systems customers deliver entire devices such as smartphones laptop computers gaming systems automobiles servers medical equipment and networking products these systems companies internally develop or externally purchase the subcomponents for their products including printed circuit boards or pcbs which interconnect all of the hardware components ics which are often referred to as computer chips and software at various levels which runs on the hardware our semiconductor customers deliver ics which include subcategories such as memory chips systemsonchip or socs analog chips processors and other types of chips 

we offer software hardware services and reusable ic design blocks which are commonly referred to as intellectual property or ip systems customers use our offerings to develop and integrate software that is key to the functionality of their products as well as to design their ics and pcbs our semiconductor customers use our offerings to design configure analyze and verify ics additionally some customers license our ip which accelerates their product development processes by providing predesigned and verified circuit blocks for their ics 

system design enablement or sde is our overall strategy to provide the technologies necessary for our customers to develop a complete and functional electronic product our sde strategy enables us to address the growing trends of electronic systems companies developing their own ics as part of their end product systems as well as semiconductor companies delivering greater portions of the systems into which their ic products are integrated the development of electronic products or their subcomponents is complex and requires many engineers using our solutions with specialized knowledge and skill the rate of technical innovation in electronics is swift long driven by a concept known as moore’s law which more than 50 years ago predicted that the complexity of ics would double about every 24 months in order to make our customers successful our products must handle this exponential growth rate in complexity without requiring a corresponding increase in our customers’ costs historically the industry that provided the tools used by ic engineers was referred to as electronic design automation or eda today our offerings include and extend beyond eda tools to include sde 

our sde solutions facilitate the electronic product creation process at four levels first our core eda offerings enable engineers to complete tasks associated with the design analysis and verification of ics core eda tools and services are specifically designed to meet the requirements of engineers who develop different types of ics the second level of sde solutions is ip which consists of design ip and verification ip or vip design ip is directly integrated into the ic by the customer as part of its development process vip consists of technologies and methodologies useful for verifying how design ip is integrated into the ic but vip does not become part of the ic product the third level of sde solutions is system interconnect and includes tools and services used for the design analysis and verification of pcbs as well as the packages that encapsulate the ics for electrical and physical connection to the pcb the fourth level of sde solutions is system integration which includes the engineering tasks associated with designing and analyzing systems verifying system functionality combining software with hardware or developing new software for an ic or system prior to its manufacture 

business drivers 

our products and services enable our customers to design complex and innovative electronic products so demand for our products is driven by our customers’ investment in new designs and products new categories of electronic systems such as augmented reality virtual reality internetofthings or iot deep learning and autonomous vehicle subsystems represent a few of the areas for potential increased investment by our customers large and existing electronics categories such as datacenter servers smartphones and networking products continue to provide business opportunities for us as customers initiate new design projects conversely the decline of previously vibrant categories and the integration of previously separate capabilities into a single device can potentially reduce our business opportunities for example digital cameras and navigation devices were once independent devices and are now also available as features on a smartphone likewise the laptop computer category has been negatively affected by the proliferation of mobile devices 

underlying the requirements within any particular vertical market sector is the availability of rapidly improving ic manufacturing technology in order for our customers to take advantage of such advancements certain of our products must first be developed to exploit these new manufacturing capabilities this dependency means that we must invest significantly in product research and development to keep pace with the latest manufacturing technology the demand for new ic manufacturing technology directly impacts the demand for our newest products 

another driver for our business is the differentiation capabilities and benefits provided to our customers by our products with the rapid pace of innovation comes the opportunity for our products to address key challenges associated with electronic product creation such as power consumption performance and cost our products have unique attributes that our customers value in general these attributes can be grouped into broader categories such as quality of results in terms of power consumption performance and chip area engineering productivity tool performance new capabilities or methods and faster timetomarket our business opportunities are significantly enhanced when our offerings address these key factors 

products and product strategy 

our strategy is to provide our customers with the ability to address the broad range of issues that arise as they develop electronic products our sde solutions are comprised of products that are categorized according to the role they play in the electronic product design process we combine our products and technologies into categories related to major design activities the following table shows the relationship between our product categories and the sde levels to which they relate

product and maintenance and services revenue 

revenue and revenue as a percentage of total revenue from our product and maintenance and services offerings for the last three fiscal years were as follows 



our revenue mix is such that approximately 90 of our revenue is recognized on a recurring basis over the contract life and the remainder of the revenue is recognized up front upon completion of delivery 

for an additional description of our product and maintenance and services revenue see the discussion under “results of operations” under part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” for our fiscal 2016 results of operations and our financial position as of december 31 2016  see part iv item 15 “exhibits and financial statement schedules” 

backlog 

our backlog was approximately  25 billion  and 23 billion  as of december 31 2016  and january 2 2016  respectively our backlog as of december 31 2016  consisted of the deferred revenue on our balance sheet and the remaining unbilled portion of fully executed arrangements with effective dates commencing no later than december 31 2016  with revenue to be recognized thereafter and included a variety of types generally including but not limited to 

 the substantial majority of our backlog consists of customer contracts for which product and maintenance revenue is recognized on a recurring basis over the contract life historically we have not experienced significant cancellations of our contracts with customers for engineering services contracts in backlog completion dates are occasionally rescheduled delaying revenue recognition under those contracts beyond the original anticipated completion date changes in customer license types or payment terms also can affect the timing of revenue recognition during fiscal 2016  approximately 70  of our revenue came from arrangements that were in backlog as of january 2 2016  we expect approximately 13 billion  or approximately 70  of our fiscal 2017 revenue to come from arrangements that were in backlog as of december 31 2016  the actual percentage of revenue coming from backlog during fiscal 2017 may change if our actual business levels in fiscal 2017 are different than our current expectations 

marketing and sales 

we generally market our products and provide services to existing and prospective customers through a direct sales force consisting of sales people and applications engineers applications engineers provide technical presales and postsales support for our products due to the complexity of many of our products and the system design process the sales cycle is generally long requiring three to six months or more during the sales cycle our direct sales force generally provides technical presentations product demonstrations and support for onsite customer evaluation of our solutions we also promote our products and services through advertising marketing automation trade shows public relations and the internet we selectively utilize valueadded resellers to broaden our reach and reduce cost of sales our orcad products and certain allegro products are primarily marketed through these channels with respect to international sales we generally market and support our products and services through our subsidiaries we also use a thirdparty distributor to license our software products and services to certain customers in japan 

research and development 

our research and development expense was 7353 million  during fiscal 2016  6376 million  during fiscal 2015  and 6030 million  during fiscal 2014  

the primary areas of our research and development include the following 

 our future performance depends on our ability to innovate commercialize newly developed solutions and enhance and maintain our current products we must keep pace with our customers’ technical developments satisfy industry standards and meet our customers’ increasingly demanding performance productivity quality and predictability requirements therefore we expect to continue to invest in research and development 

hardware manufacturing and software distribution 

the majority of our emulation and prototyping hardware including all individual pcbs and custom ics is manufactured assembled and tested by subcontractors before delivery to our customers all assembly system integration and testing of our fieldprogrammable gate array or fpga based prototyping products is done by our manufacturing partners before supplying them to us for qualification and testing before their incorporation into the integrated product at our headquarters in san jose california 

software and documentation are primarily distributed to customers by secure electronic delivery or on dvd 

proprietary technology 

our success depends in part upon our proprietary technology we generally rely on patents copyrights trademarks and trade secret laws licenses and restrictive agreements to establish and protect our proprietary rights in technology and products many of our products include software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties we may have to seek new licenses or renew existing licenses for thirdparty software and other intellectual property in the future as part of performing engineering services for customers our engineering services business uses certain software and other intellectual property licensed from third parties including that of our competitors 

competition 

we compete in eda most frequently with synopsys inc and mentor graphics corporation which is in the process of being acquired by siemens ag but also with numerous other eda providers such as ansys inc zuken ltd and others offering “point solutions” with manufacturers of electronic devices that have developed acquired or have the capability to develop their own eda products and with numerous electronics design and consulting companies in the area of design ip we compete with synopsys inc ceva inc and numerous other ip companies 

certain competitive factors in the engineering services business differ from those of the products businesses while we compete with other eda companies in the engineering services business our principal competitors include independent engineering service businesses many of these companies are also customers and therefore use our product offerings in the delivery of their services or products

 item 1a risk factors 

our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties including those described in the sections below that could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations cash flows and the trading price of our common stock 

risks related to our business 

uncertainty in the global economy in general and any potential downturn in the semiconductor and electronics industries in particular may negatively impact our business and reduce our bookings levels and revenue 

purchases of our products and services are dependent upon the commencement of new design projects by ic manufacturers and electronics systems companies the ic and electronics systems industries are cyclical and are characterized by constant and rapid technological change rapid product obsolescence and price erosion evolving standards short product life cycles and wide fluctuations in product supply and demand 

the ic and electronics systems industries have also experienced significant downturns in connection with or in anticipation of maturing product cycles of both these industries’ and their customers’ products while spending on eda products and services has grown in recent years the current outlook for the semiconductor industry is uncertain and may result in a decrease in spending on eda products and services which are a part of our overall sde offering 

while we cannot predict global economic conditions uncertainty about future political and economic conditions and future decline in consumer spending could negatively impact our customers’ businesses reducing the number of new chip designs and their overall research and development spending including their spending on sde products and services and as a result decrease demand for our products decreased bookings for our products and services customer bankruptcies consolidation among our customers or problems or delays with our hardware suppliers or with the supply or delivery of our hardware products could also adversely affect our ability to grow our business or adversely affect our future revenues and financial results our future business and financial results are subject to considerable uncertainty that could impact our stock price if economic conditions deteriorate in the future or in particular if semiconductor or electronics systems industry revenues do not grow or our suppliers of our hardware components and products are subject to problems or delays our future revenues and financial results could be adversely affected however if economic conditions improve for our customers the positive impact on our revenues and financial results may be deferred due to cautious customer research and development spending and our mix of licenses that result in recurring revenue 

customer consolidation could affect our operating results 

there has been a trend toward customer consolidation in the semiconductor industry through business combinations including mergers asset acquisitions and strategic partnerships as this trend continues it could make us dependent on fewer customers who may be able to exert increased pressure on our prices and other contract terms and could increase the portion of our total sales concentration for any single customer customer consolidation activity could also reduce the demand for our products and services if such customers streamline research and development or operations reduce purchases or delay purchasing decisions these outcomes could negatively impact our financial condition 

our failure to respond quickly to technological developments or customers’ increasing technological requirements could make our products uncompetitive and obsolete 

the industries in which we compete experience rapid technology developments rapid changes in industry standards and customer requirements and frequent introductions and improvements of new products currently the industries we serve are experiencing the following trends 

 

 if we are unable to respond quickly and successfully to these trends we may lose our competitive position and our products or technologies may become obsolete to compete successfully we must develop acquire or license new products and improve our existing products and processes on a schedule that keeps pace with technological developments and the requirements for products addressing a broad spectrum of designers and designer expertise in our industries we must provide frequent and relevant updates to our software products in order to provide substantial benefit to the customer throughout the license periods because of the rapid changes in our customer’s industries the market must also accept our new and improved products our hardware platforms must be enhanced periodically to reduce the likelihood that a competitor surpasses the capabilities we offer our introduction of new products could reduce the demand and revenue of our older products or affect their pricing we must also be able to support a range of changing computer software hardware platforms and customer preferences a rapid transition to different business models associated with cloud computing technologies could result in reduced revenue we cannot guarantee that we will be successful in keeping pace with all or any of the customer trends 

competitive pressures may require us to reduce our pricing which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

the highly competitive markets in which we do business can put pressure on us to reduce the prices of our software emulation and prototyping hardware and ip if our competitors offer deep discounts on certain products in an effort to recapture or gain market share or to sell other software or hardware products we may then need to lower our prices or offer other favorable terms to compete successfully any such changes would be likely to reduce our profit margins and could adversely affect our operating results any substantial changes to our prices and pricing policies could cause revenues to decline or be delayed as our sales force implements and our customers adjust to the new pricing policies some of our competitors bundle products for promotional purposes or as a longterm pricing strategy or provide guarantees of prices and product implementations these practices could over time significantly constrain the prices that we can charge for our products if we cannot offset price reductions with a corresponding increase in the number of sales or with lower spending then the reduced revenues resulting from lower prices could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

our system design enablement strategy requires the development or acquisition of products and expertise in new areas of technology our inability to develop or acquire these capabilities could impede our ability to address the technical requirements in technology segments which are expected to contribute to our growth 

our sde strategy is meant to increase our business among electronic systems companies which are now designing their own ics in addition to the complete end products of which they are a part sde is also meant to increase our business among semiconductor companies which are increasing their contribution to the end products into which their ics are incorporated part of this strategy involves addressing the needs of new categories of electronic systems such as augmented reality virtual reality internetofthings or iot deep learning and autonomous vehicle subsystems where increased investment is expected by our customers each of these categories requires technologies and expertise that are applicationspecific if we are unable to develop or acquire the applicationspecific technologies and expertise necessary to address the requirements of these categories it could impede our ability to expand our business in these categories and ultimately affect our future growth 

we have experienced varied operating results and our operating results for any particular fiscal period are affected by the timing of revenue recognition particularly for our emulation and prototyping hardware and ip products 

various factors affect our operating results and some of them are not within our control our operating results for any period are affected by the timing of revenue recognition particularly for our emulation and prototyping hardware and ip products in addition we have recorded net losses in the past and may record net losses in the future 

a substantial portion of the product revenue related to our hardware business and some of our ip offerings is recognized upon delivery and our forecasted revenue results are based in part on our expectations of hardware and ip to be delivered in a particular quarter therefore changes in hardware and ip bookings or deliveries relative to expectations will have a more immediate impact on our revenue than changes in software or services bookings for which revenue is generally recognized over time 

in recent years we made significant investments to expand our ip offerings through among other things research and development and acquisitions as we continue to expand our ip offerings a portion of the revenue related to our ip bookings will be deferred until we complete and deliver the licensed ip to our customers as a result costs related to the research and development of the ip may be incurred prior to the recognition of the related revenue 

revenue related to our hardware and ip products is inherently difficult to predict because sales of our hardware and ip products depend on the commencement of new projects for the design and development of complex ics and systems by our customers our customers’ willingness to expend capital to deploy our hardware or ip products in those projects and the availability of our hardware or ip products for delivery therefore our hardware or ip sales may be delayed or may decrease if our customers delay or cancel projects because their spending is constrained or if there are problems or delays with the supply or delivery of our hardware or ip products or our hardware suppliers moreover the hardware and ip markets are highly competitive and our customers may choose to purchase a competitor’s hardware or ip product based on cost performance or other factors these factors may result in lower revenue which would have an adverse effect on our business results of operations or cash flows 

our software license mix is such that a substantial proportion of licenses require recurring revenue recognition and we expect the license mix combined with the modest growth in spending by our customers in the semiconductor sector may make it difficult for us to rapidly increase our revenue in future fiscal periods the timing of our revenue recognition may be deferred until payments become due and payable from customers with nonlinear payment terms or as cash is collected from customers with low credit ratings 

we plan our operating expenses based on forecasted revenue expected business needs and other factors these expenses and the effect of longterm commitments are relatively fixed in the short term bookings and the related revenue are harder to forecast in a difficult economic environment if we experience a shortfall in bookings our operating results could differ from our expectations because we may not be able to quickly reduce our expenses in response to shortterm business changes 

the methods estimates and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies have a significant impact on our results of operations see “critical accounting estimates” under part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” such methods estimates and judgments are by their nature subject to substantial risks uncertainties and assumptions and factors may arise over time that may lead us to change our methods estimates and judgments changes in those methods estimates and judgments could significantly affect our results of operations 

historical results of operations should not be viewed as reliable indicators of our future performance if our revenue operating results or business outlook for future periods fall short of the levels expected by us securities analysts or investors the trading price of our common stock could decline 

we have acquired and expect to acquire other companies and businesses and may not realize the expected benefits of these acquisitions 

we have acquired and expect to acquire other companies and businesses in order to expand our product offerings our future revenue growth and expansion of our business is dependent on our successful integration of our acquisitions we may incur significant costs in connection with potential transactions including acquisitions that are not consummated potential and completed acquisitions involve a number of risks if any of the following acquisitionrelated risks occur our business operating results or financial condition could be adversely impacted 



 in a number of our completed acquisitions we have agreed to make future payments either in the form of employee retention bonuses or contingent purchase price payments based on the performance of the acquired companies businesses or the employees who joined us with the acquired companies or businesses the performance goals pursuant to which these future payments may be made generally relate to the achievement by the acquired company or business or by the employees who joined us with the acquired company or business of certain specified bookings revenue run rate product proliferation product development or employee retention goals during a specified period following completion of the applicable acquisition the specific performance goal levels and amounts and timing of employee bonuses or contingent purchase price payments vary with each acquisition we may continue to use contingent purchase price payments in connection with acquisitions in the future and while we expect to derive value from an acquisition in excess of such contingent payment obligations we may be required to make certain contingent payments without deriving the anticipated value 

future acquisitions may involve issuances of stock as full or partial payment of the purchase price for the acquired company or business grants of restricted stock restricted stock units or stock options to employees of the acquired companies or businesses which may be dilutive to existing stockholders expenditure of substantial cash resources or the incurrence of a material amount of debt these arrangements may impact our liquidity financial position and results of operations or increase dilution of our stockholders’ equity interests in the company 

we have invested and expect to continue to invest in research and development efforts for new and existing products and technologies and technical sales support such investments may affect our operating results and if the return on these investments is lower or develops more slowly than we expect our revenue and operating results may suffer 

we have invested and expect to continue to invest in research and development for new and existing products technologies and services in response to our customers’ increasing technological requirements such investments may be in related areas such as technical sales support these investments may involve significant time risks and uncertainties including the risk that the expenses associated with these investments may affect our margins and operating results and that such investments may not generate sufficient revenues to offset liabilities assumed and expenses associated with these new investments we believe that we must continue to invest a significant amount of time and resources in our research and development efforts and technical sales support to maintain and improve our competitive position if we do not achieve the benefits anticipated from these investments if the achievement of these benefits is delayed or if a potential slowdown in “moore’s law” occurs which may reduce or slow the need for customers to upgrade or enhance their eda products and design flows our revenue and operating results may be adversely affected 

the competition in our industries is substantial and we may not be able to continue to successfully compete in our industries 

the eda industry the commercial electronics engineering services industry and the ip industry are highly competitive if we fail to compete successfully in these industries it could seriously harm our business operating results or financial condition to compete in these industries we must identify and develop or acquire innovative and costcompetitive eda products integrate them into platforms and market them in a timely manner we may not be able to compete successfully in these industries factors that could affect our ability to compete successfully include 



 we compete in eda most frequently with synopsys inc and mentor graphics corporation which is in the process of being acquired by siemens ag but also with numerous other eda providers such as ansys inc zuken ltd and many others offering “point solutions” with manufacturers of electronic devices that have developed acquired or have the capability to develop their own eda products and with numerous electronics design and consulting companies in the area of design ip we compete with synopsys inc ceva inc and numerous other ip companies 

the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations may adversely impact our revenue expenses cash flows and financial condition 

we have significant operations outside the united states our revenue from international operations as a percentage of total revenue was approximately 54  during both fiscal 2016  and fiscal 2015  and 56  during fiscal 2014  we expect that revenue from our international operations will continue to account for a significant portion of our total revenue we also transact business in various foreign currencies volatility of foreign currencies in certain countries where we conduct business most notably the chinese renminbi japanese yen european union euro british pound and indian rupee have had and may in the future have an effect on our revenue or operating results 

fluctuations in the rate of exchange between the us dollar and the currencies of other countries where we conduct business could seriously affect our business operating results or financial condition for example when a foreign currency declines in value relative to the us dollar it takes more of the foreign currency to purchase the same amount of us dollars than before the change if we price our products and services in the foreign currency we receive fewer us dollars than we did before the change if we price our products and services in us dollars the decrease in value of the local currency results in an increase in the price for our products and services compared to those products of our competitors that are priced in local currency this could result in our prices being uncompetitive in markets where business is transacted in the local currency on the other hand when a foreign currency increases in value relative to the us dollar it takes more us dollars to purchase the same amount of the foreign currency as we use the foreign currency to fund payroll costs and other operating expenses in our international operations this results in an increase in operating expenses approximately 30 of our total costs and expenses are transacted in foreign currencies our attempts to reduce the effect of foreign currency fluctuations may be unsuccessful and significant exchange rate movements may adversely impact our results of operations as expressed in us dollars 

our operating results could be adversely affected by an increase in our effective tax rate as a result of tax law changes outcomes of current or future tax examinations or by material differences between our forecasted and actual effective tax rates 

our operations are subject to income and transaction taxes in the united states and in multiple foreign jurisdictions with a significant amount of our foreign earnings generated by our subsidiaries organized in ireland and hungary any significant change in our future effective tax rates could adversely impact our results of operations for future periods our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by the following 



the irs and other tax authorities regularly examine our income tax returns and other nonincome tax returns such as payroll sales use valueadded net worth or franchise property goods and services consumption import stamp and excise taxes in both the united states and foreign jurisdictions the calculation of our provision for income taxes and our accruals for other taxes requires us to use significant judgment and involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes we regularly assess the potential settlement outcomes resulting from income tax examinations however the final outcome of tax examinations including the total amount payable or the timing of any such payments upon resolution of these issues cannot be estimated with certainty in addition we cannot be certain that such amount will not be materially different from the amount that is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals for other taxes should the irs or other tax authorities assess additional taxes penalties or interest as a result of a current or a future examination we may be required to record charges to operations in future periods that could have a material impact on our results of operations financial position or cash flows in the applicable period or periods 

forecasts of our annual effective tax rate are complex and subject to uncertainty because our income tax position for each year combines the effects of estimating our annual income or loss the mix of profits and losses earned by us and our subsidiaries in tax jurisdictions with a broad range of income tax rates as well as benefits from available deferred tax assets the impact of various accounting rules and results of tax audits forecasts of our annual effective tax rate do not include the anticipation of future tax law changes in addition we account for certain tax benefits from stockbased compensation in the period the stock compensation is settled which may cause increased variability in our quarterly effective tax rates if there were a material difference between forecasted and actual tax rates then it could have a material impact on our results of operations 

tax laws regulations and enforcement practices are evolving and may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flows and financial position 

tax laws regulations and administrative practices in various jurisdictions are evolving and may be subject to significant changes due to economic political and other conditions there are many transactions that occur during the ordinary course of business for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain and significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our provision and accruals for these taxes governments are increasingly focused on ways to increase tax revenues particularly from multinational corporations which may lead to an increase in audit activity and harsher positions taken by tax authorities we are currently subject to tax audits in various jurisdictions and these jurisdictions may assess additional tax liabilities against us 

the current us administration and certain members of congress have made public statements indicating that corporate tax reform is a priority changes to us tax laws could materially affect the tax treatment of our domestic and foreign earnings the organisation for economic cooperation and development an international association of 34 countries including the united states released the final reports from its base erosion and profit shifting or beps action plans which aim to standardize and modernize global tax policies the beps action plans propose revisions to numerous tax rules including countrybycountry reporting permanent establishment hybrid entities and instruments transfer pricing and tax treaties the beps action plans have been or are being enacted by countries where we have operations the european commission has conducted investigations in multiple countries focusing on whether local country tax rulings provide preferential tax treatment that violates european union state aid rules and concluded that certain countries including ireland have provided illegal state aid in certain cases 

developments in relevant tax laws regulations administrative practices and enforcement practices could have a material adverse effect on our operating results financial position and cash flows including the need to obtain additional financing 

our stock price has been subject to fluctuations and may continue to be subject to fluctuations 

the market price of our common stock has experienced fluctuations and may fluctuate or decline in the future and as a result you could lose the value of your investment the market price of our common stock may be affected by a number of factors including 



in addition equity markets in general and the equities of technology companies in particular have experienced and may experience in the future extreme price and volume fluctuations due to among other factors the actions of market participants or other actions outside of our control such price and volume fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock for reasons unrelated to our business or operating results 

our future revenue is dependent in part upon our installed customer base continuing to license or buy products and purchase services 

our installed customer base has traditionally generated additional new license service and maintenance revenues in future periods customers may not necessarily license or buy additional products or contract for additional services or maintenance our customers many of which are large semiconductor and systems companies often have significant bargaining power in negotiations with us customer consolidation can reduce the total level of purchases of our software hardware ip and services and in some cases increase customers’ bargaining power in negotiations with their suppliers including us 

we could suffer serious harm to our business because of the infringement of our intellectual property rights by third parties or because of our infringement of the intellectual property rights of third parties 

there are numerous patents relating to our business and ecosystem new patents are being issued at a rapid rate and are owned by eda companies as well as entities and individuals outside the eda industry including parties whose income is primarily derived from infringementrelated licensing and litigation it is not always practicable to determine in advance whether a product or any of its components infringes the patent rights of others as a result from time to time we may be compelled to respond to or prosecute intellectual property infringement claims to protect our rights or defend a customer’s rights 

intellectual property infringement claims including contractual defense reimbursement obligations related to thirdparty claims against our customers regardless of merit could consume valuable management time result in costly litigation or cause product shipment delays all of which could seriously harm our business operating results or financial condition the risk of infringement and related indemnification claims associated with design ip products that are incorporated into a customer product broadly used by consumers may be higher than the risk associated with our software products in settling these claims we may be required to enter into royalty or licensing agreements with the third parties claiming infringement these royalty or licensing agreements if available may not have terms favorable to us being compelled to enter into a license agreement with unfavorable terms could seriously harm our business operating results or financial condition any potential intellectual property litigation could compel us to do one or more of the following 

 if we were compelled to take any of these actions our business or operating results may suffer 

if our security measures are breached and an unauthorized party obtains access to customer data or our proprietary business information our information systems may be perceived as being unsecure which could harm our business and reputation 

our products and services involve the storage and transmission of our proprietary information and that of our customers we have offices throughout the world including key research and development facilities outside of the united states our operations are dependent upon the connectivity of our operations throughout the world despite our security measures our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to cyber attacks or breached which could result in unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information and could significantly interfere with our business operations breaches of our security measures could expose us to a risk of loss or misuse of this information litigation and potential liability because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage information systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventive measures in addition if we select a vendor that uses cyber storage of information as part of their service or product offerings despite our attempts to validate the security of such services our proprietary information may be misappropriated by third parties in the event of an actual or perceived breach of our security or the security of one of our vendors the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed and we could suffer damage to our reputation or our business or lose existing customers and our ability to obtain new customers 

risks associated with our international operations could adversely impact our financial condition 

a significant amount of our revenue is derived from our international operations and we have offices throughout the world including key research and development facilities outside of the united states our international operations may be subject to a number of risks including 

 some of our international research and development and other facilities are in parts of the world where there may be a greater risk of business interruption as a result of political instability terrorist acts or military conflicts than businesses located domestically furthermore this potential harm is exacerbated because damage to or disruptions at our international research and development facilities could have a more significant adverse effect on our ability to develop new or improve existing products than other businesses that may only have sales offices or other less critical operations abroad we are not insured for losses or interruptions caused by acts of war furthermore our operations are dependent upon the connectivity of our operations throughout the world activities that interfere with our international connectivity or operations such as cyber hacking the introduction of a virus into our computer systems natural disasters civil unrest or terrorism could significantly interfere with our business operations 

in addition internal controls policies and procedures and employee training and compliance programs that we have implemented to deter prohibited practices may not prevent our employees contractors or agents from violating or circumventing our policies and the laws and regulations applicable to our worldwide operations 

we depend upon our management team and key employees and our failure to attract train motivate and retain management and key employees may make us less competitive and therefore harm our results of operations 

our business depends upon the continued services efforts and abilities of our senior management and other key employees competition for highly skilled executive officers and employees can be intense particularly in geographic areas recognized as high technology centers such as the silicon valley area where our principal offices are located and in other locations where we maintain facilities in addition competition for qualified personnel including software engineers in the eda commercial electronics engineering services and ip industries has intensified we may also experience increased compensation costs that are not offset by either improved productivity or higher sales we may not be successful in recruiting new personnel and in retaining and motivating existing personnel from time to time there may be changes in our management team resulting from the hiring and departure of executive officers and as a result we may experience disruption to our business that may harm our operating results and our relationships with our employees customers and suppliers may be adversely affected 

to attract retain and motivate individuals with the requisite expertise we may be required to grant large numbers of stock options or other stockbased incentive awards which may be dilutive to existing stockholders and increase compensation expense and pay significant base salaries and cash bonuses which could harm our operating results the high cost of training new employees not fully utilizing these employees or losing trained employees to competing employers could also reduce our operating margins and harm our business or operating results 

in addition applicable rules and regulations require stockholder approval for new equity compensation plans and significant amendments to existing equity compensation plans including increases in shares available for issuance under such plans and prohibit publiclytraded companies from giving a proxy to vote on equity compensation plans unless the beneficial owner of the shares has given voting instructions these rules and regulations could make it more difficult for us to grant equity compensation to employees in the future to the extent that these regulations make it more difficult or expensive to grant equity compensation to employees we may incur increased compensation costs or find it difficult to attract retain and motivate employees which could materially and adversely affect our business 

we rely on our proprietary technology as well as software and other intellectual property rights licensed to us by third parties and we cannot assure you that the precautions taken to protect our rights will be adequate or that we will continue to be able to adequately secure such intellectual property rights from third parties 

our success depends in part upon our proprietary technology we generally rely on patents copyrights trademarks trade secrets licenses and restrictive agreements to establish and protect our proprietary rights in technology and products despite the precautions we may take to protect our intellectual property third parties have tried in the past and may try in the future to challenge invalidate or circumvent these safeguards our patents and other intellectual property rights may not provide us with sufficient competitive advantages patents may not be issued on any of our pending applications and our issued patents may not be sufficiently broad to protect our technology furthermore the laws of foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights in those countries to the same extent as applicable law protects these rights in the united states the protection of our intellectual property may require the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources moreover the steps we take to protect our intellectual property may not adequately protect our rights or deter or prevent third parties from infringing or misappropriating our proprietary rights 

many of our products include software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties we may have to seek new or renew existing licenses for such software and other intellectual property in the future our engineering services business holds licenses to certain software and other intellectual property owned by third parties including that of our competitors our failure to obtain software other intellectual property licenses or other intellectual property rights that are necessary or helpful for our business on favorable terms or our need to engage in litigation over these licenses or rights could seriously harm our business operating results or financial condition 

we have substantial cash requirements in the united states but a significant portion of our cash is held and generated outside of the united states and if our cash available in the united states and the cash available under our revolving credit facility are insufficient to meet our operating expenses and debt repayment obligations in the united states then we may be required to raise cash in ways that could negatively affect our financial condition results of operations and the market price of our common stock 

we have significant operations outside the united states as of december 31 2016  approximately 63  of our cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments balance was held by subsidiaries outside the united states with the remainder of the balance held by us or our subsidiaries in the united states we believe that the combination of our us cash cash equivalents future us operating cash flows cash available under our revolving credit facility and other cash that may be accessible to us on attractive terms are sufficient to meet our ongoing us operating expenses and debt repayment obligations however if these sources of cash were insufficient to meet our future funding obligations in the united states we could be required to seek funding sources on less attractive terms which could negatively impact our results of operations financial position and the market price of our common stock 

litigation could adversely affect our financial condition or operations 

we currently are and in the future may be involved in various disputes and litigation that arise in the ordinary course of business these include disputes and lawsuits related to intellectual property including customer indemnification mergers and acquisitions licensing contracts distribution arrangements and employee relations matters for information regarding the litigation matters in which we are currently engaged please refer to the discussion under part i item 3 “legal proceedings” and note 11 in the notes to consolidated financial statements we cannot provide any assurances that the final outcome of these lawsuits or any other proceedings that may arise in the future will not have a material adverse effect on our business operating results financial condition or cash flows litigation can be time consuming and expensive and could divert management’s time and attention from our business which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and operating results 

errors or defects in our products and services could expose us to liability and harm our business 

our customers use our products and services in designing and developing products that involve a high degree of technological complexity each of which has its own specifications because of the complexity of the systems and products with which we work some of our products and designs can be adequately tested only when put to full use in the marketplace as a result our customers or their end users may discover errors or defects in our software or the systems we design or the products or systems incorporating our design and intellectual property may not operate as expected errors or defects could result in 

 our operating results and revenue could be adversely affected by customer payment delays customer bankruptcies and defaults or modifications of licenses 

occasionally our customers file for bankruptcy or request to modify license terms if our customers experience adversity in their business they may delay or default on their payment obligations to us file for bankruptcy or modify or cancel plans to license our products for instance if our customers are not successful in generating sufficient cash or are precluded from securing financing they may not be able to pay or may delay payment of accounts receivable that are owed to us although these obligations are generally not cancelable our customers’ inability to fulfill payment obligations in turn may adversely affect our revenue and cash flow additionally our customers have in the past sought and may in the future seek to renegotiate preexisting contractual commitments payment defaults by our customers or significant reductions in existing contractual commitments could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results 

the long sales cycle of our products and services may cause our operating results to fluctuate unexpectedly 

generally we have a long sales cycle that can extend up to six months or longer the complexity and expense associated with our products and services generally require a lengthy customer education evaluation and approval process consequently we may incur substantial expenses and devote significant management effort and expense to develop potential relationships that do not result in agreements or revenue and may prevent us from pursuing other opportunities 

in addition sales of our products and services have been and may in the future be delayed if customers delay approval or commencement of projects because of 

 long sales cycles for hardware products subject us to a number of significant risks over which we have limited control including insufficient excess or obsolete inventory variations in inventory valuation and fluctuations in quarterly operating results 

our reported financial results may be adversely affected by changes in united states generally accepted accounting principles and we may incur significant costs to adjust our accounting systems and processes to comply with significant changes 

united states generally accepted accounting principles or us gaap are subject to interpretation by the financial accounting standards board or fasb the sec and various bodies formed to promulgate and interpret appropriate accounting principles we are also subject to evolving rules and regulations of the countries in which we do business the fasb is currently working together with the international accounting standards board or iasb on several projects to further align accounting principles and facilitate more comparable financial reporting between companies that are required to follow us gaap under sec regulations and those that are required to follow ifrs outside of the united states these efforts by the fasb and iasb may result in different accounting principles under us gaap that could have a significant effect on our reported financial results for us in areas including but not limited to principles for recognizing revenue and accounting for leases for information regarding new accounting standards please refer to part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” under the heading “new accounting standards” 

in addition we may need to significantly change our customer contracts accounting systems and processes when we adopt future or proposed changes in accounting principles noted above the cost and effect of these changes may negatively impact our results of operations during the periods of transition 

our restructuring plans may not result in the benefits we have anticipated possibly having a negative effect on our future operating results 

in recent fiscal years we have initiated restructuring plans in an effort to reallocate or decrease costs by reducing our workforce and by consolidating facilities we incur substantial costs to implement restructuring plans and our restructuring activities may subject us to litigation risks and expenses our past restructuring plans do not provide any assurance that additional restructuring plans will not be required or implemented in the future in addition our restructuring plans may have other consequences such as attrition beyond our planned reduction in workforce a negative effect on employee morale and productivity or our ability to attract highly skilled employees our competitors may also use our restructuring plans to seek to gain a competitive advantage over us as a result our restructuring plans may affect our revenue and other operating results in the future 

failure to obtain export licenses could harm our business by rendering us unable to ship products and transfer our technology outside of the united states 

we must comply with regulations of the united states and of certain other countries in shipping our products and transferring our technology outside the united states and to foreign nationals any significant future difficulty in complying with these regulations could harm our business operating results or financial condition 

if we become subject to unfair hiring claims we could be prevented from hiring needed employees incur liability for damages and incur substantial costs in defending ourselves 

when companies in our industry lose employees to competitors they frequently claim that these competitors have engaged in unfair hiring practices or that the employment of these persons would involve the disclosure or use of trade secrets these claims could prevent us from hiring employees or cause us to incur liability for damages we could also incur substantial costs in defending ourselves or our employees against these claims regardless of their merits defending ourselves from these claims could also divert the attention of our management away from our operations 

antitakeover defenses in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and certain provisions under delaware law could prevent an acquisition of our company or limit the price that investors might be willing to pay for our common stock 

our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and certain provisions of the delaware general corporation law that apply to us could make it difficult for another company to acquire control of our company for example 

 all or any one of these factors could limit the price that certain investors would be willing to pay for shares of our common stock and could allow our board of directors to resist delay or prevent an acquisition of our company even if a proposed transaction were favored by a majority of our independent stockholders   

the investment of our cash in money market funds is subject to risks that may cause losses and affect the liquidity of these investments 

our investments include various money market funds weakened financial markets have at times adversely impacted the general credit liquidity market prices and interest rates for these and other types of investments additionally changes in monetary policy by the federal open market committee and concerns about the rising us government debt level may cause a decrease in the purchasing power of the us dollar and adversely affect our investment portfolio the financial market and monetary risks associated with our investment portfolio may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition liquidity results of operations or cash flows 

we depend on sole suppliers for certain hardware components and contract manufacturers for production of our emulation and prototyping hardware products making us vulnerable to supply disruption and price fluctuation 

we depend on sole suppliers for certain hardware components and contract manufacturers for production of our emulation and prototyping hardware products our reliance on sole suppliers and contract manufacturers could result in product delivery problems and delays and reduced control over product pricing and quality though we prefer to have multiple sources to procure certain key components in some cases it is not practical or feasible to do so we may suffer a disruption in the supply of certain hardware components if we are unable to purchase sufficient components on a timely basis or at all for any reason any supply or manufacturing disruption including delay in delivery of components by our suppliers or products by our manufacturers or the bankruptcy or shutdown of our suppliers or manufacturers could delay our production process and prevent us from delivering completed hardware products to customers or from supplying new evaluation units to customers which could have a negative impact on our revenue and operating results 

we are subject to evolving corporate governance and public disclosure regulations that impact compliance costs and risks of noncompliance 

we are subject to changing rules and regulations promulgated by a number of governmental and selfregulatory organizations including the sec nasdaq and the fasb these rules and regulations continue to evolve in scope and complexity and many new requirements have been created in response to laws enacted by congress making compliance more difficult and uncertain the increase in costs to comply with such evolving rules and regulations as well as any risk of noncompliance could adversely impact us 

conflict minerals regulations may cause us to continue to incur additional expenses and may adversely impact our ability to conduct our business 

in august 2012 the sec adopted new rules establishing disclosure and reporting requirements regarding the use of certain minerals referred to as “conflict minerals” in products these rules require us to determine disclose and report whether or not such minerals in our products originate from the democratic republic of the congo or adjoining countries we have incurred and expect to continue to incur costs to comply with these rules including costs associated with conducting due diligence on our supply chain and fulfilling our reporting requirements and we may incur costs related to changes to our products processes or sources of supply in addition these rules could affect the availability of certain minerals used in the manufacture of our emulation and prototyping hardware products and ip boards or the covered products and thus impact our ability to source at competitive prices certain materials that are used in the covered products finally our customers may prefer to purchase products from vendors who claim that all minerals in their products are conflictfree and our revenues may be harmed or we may face reputational challenges if we are unable to verify that our covered products are conflictfree 

our business is subject to the risk of earthquakes and other natural disasters 

our corporate headquarters including certain of our research and development operations and certain of our distribution facilities is located in the silicon valley area of northern california a region known to experience seismic activity if significant seismic activity were to occur our operations may be interrupted which could adversely impact our business and results of operations 

our other offices in the united states and in other countries around the world may be adversely impacted by natural disasters if a natural disaster occurs at or near any of our offices our operations may be interrupted which could adversely impact our business and results of operations if a natural disaster impacts a significant number of our customers our business and results of operations could be adversely impacted 

risks related to our securities and indebtedness 

our debt obligations expose us to risks that could adversely affect our business operating results or financial condition and could prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under such indebtedness 

we have a substantial level of debt as of december 31 2016  we had total outstanding indebtedness of 6935 million  we also had the ability to borrow an additional 2000 million  under our revolving credit facility with the right to request increased capacity up to an additional 1500 million  upon the receipt of lender commitments for total maximum borrowings of 4000 million  under our revolving credit facility subject to the limits contained in the credit agreement governing our revolving credit facility the indenture that governs the 4375 senior notes due 2024 or the 2024 notes and our other debt instruments we may be able to incur substantial additional debt from time to time to finance working capital capital expenditures investments or acquisitions share repurchases or for other purposes if we do so the risks related to our high level of debt could intensify specifically our high level of debt could have important consequences including the following 



 acquisitions or other general corporate requirements 

 purposes thereby reducing the amount of cash flows available for working capital capital expenditures 

acquisitions and other general corporate purposes 

 our revolving credit facility are at variable rates of interest 

 at the option of the holders of our outstanding notes we may under certain circumstances be required to repurchase such notes 

under the terms of our 2024 notes we may be required to repurchase for cash such notes prior to their maturity in connection with the occurrence of certain significant corporate events specifically we are required to offer to repurchase such notes upon a “change of control triggering event” as defined in the indenture related to such notes such as a change of control accompanied by certain downgrades in the credit ratings of such notes the repayment obligations under such notes may have the effect of discouraging delaying or preventing a takeover of our company if we were required to pay the 2024 notes prior to their scheduled maturity it could have a significant negative impact on our cash and liquidity and could impact our ability to invest financial resources in other strategic initiatives 

the terms of the agreements governing our revolving credit facility and 2019 term loan and the indenture governing our 2024 notes restrict our current and future operations particularly our ability to respond to changes or to take certain actions 

the agreements governing our revolving credit facility and 2019 term loan contain a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and may limit our ability to engage in acts that may be in our longterm best interest including restrictions on our ability to 

 in addition the restrictive covenants in the agreements governing our revolving credit facility and 2019 term loan require us to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy other financial condition tests our ability to meet those financial ratios and tests can be affected by events beyond our control and we may be unable to meet them 

a breach of the covenants or restrictions under the agreements governing our revolving credit facility and 2019 term loan could result in an event of default under the applicable indebtedness such a default may allow the creditors to accelerate the related debt and may result in the acceleration of any other debt to which a crossacceleration or crossdefault provision applies in addition an event of default under the credit agreement governing our revolving credit facility would permit the lenders under our revolving credit facility to terminate all commitments to extend further credit under that facility in the event our lenders or note holders accelerate the repayment of our borrowings we and our subsidiaries may not have sufficient assets to repay that indebtedness as a result of these restrictions we may be 



the indenture governing our 2024 notes also contains certain restrictive covenants that impose operating and financial restrictions on us and may limit our ability to engage in acts that may be in our longterm best interest including restrictions on our ability to incur liens and to enter into sale and leaseback transactions 

these restrictions may affect our ability to grow in accordance with our strategy in addition our financial results our substantial indebtedness and our credit ratings could adversely affect the availability and terms of our financing 

we may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness which may not be successful 

our ability to make scheduled payments on or refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial condition and operating performance which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial business legislative regulatory and other factors beyond our control we may be unable to maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal premium if any and interest on our indebtedness 

if our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations we could face substantial liquidity problems and could be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures or to dispose of material assets or operations seek additional debt or equity capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness we may not be able to effect any such alternative measures if necessary on commercially reasonable terms or at all and even if successful those alternative actions may not allow us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations the agreements governing our revolving credit facility and 2019 term loan restrict our ability to dispose of assets and use the proceeds from those dispositions and may also restrict our ability to raise debt or equity capital to be used to repay other indebtedness when it becomes due we may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain proceeds in an amount sufficient to meet any debt service obligations then due 

in addition we conduct a substantial portion of our operations through our subsidiaries none of which are currently guarantors of our indebtedness accordingly repayment of our indebtedness is dependent on the generation of cash flow by our subsidiaries and their ability to make such cash available to us by dividend debt repayment or otherwise unless they become guarantors of our indebtedness our subsidiaries do not have any obligation to pay amounts due on our indebtedness or to make funds available for that purpose our subsidiaries may not be able to or may not be permitted to make distributions to enable us to make payments in respect of our indebtedness each subsidiary is a distinct legal entity and under certain circumstances legal and contractual restrictions may limit our ability to obtain cash from our subsidiaries while the agreements governing our revolving credit facility and 2019 term loan limit the ability of our subsidiaries to incur consensual restrictions on their ability to pay dividends or make other intercompany payments to us these limitations are subject to qualifications and exceptions in the event that we do not receive distributions from our subsidiaries we may be unable to make required principal and interest payments on our indebtedness 

our inability to generate sufficient cash flows to satisfy our debt obligations or to refinance our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all would materially and adversely affect our financial position and results of operations and our ability to satisfy our debt obligations 

if we cannot make scheduled payments on our debt we will be in default and holders of our debt could declare all outstanding principal and interest to be due and payable the lenders under our revolving credit facility could terminate their commitments to loan money and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation in addition a material default on our indebtedness could suspend our eligibility to register securities using certain registration statement forms under sec guidelines that permit incorporation by reference of substantial information regarding us potentially hindering our ability to raise capital through the issuance of our securities and increasing our costs of registration 

despite our current level of indebtedness we and our subsidiaries may incur substantially more debt this could further exacerbate the risks to our financial condition described above 

we and our subsidiaries may incur significant additional indebtedness in the future although the agreements governing our revolving credit facility and 2019 term loan contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions and the additional indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial if we incur any additional indebtedness that ranks equally with the 2024 notes then subject to any collateral arrangements we may enter into the holders of that debt will be entitled to share ratably in any proceeds distributed in connection with any insolvency liquidation reorganization dissolution or other winding up of our company 

our variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly 

borrowings under our revolving credit facility and 2019 term loan are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk if interest rates were to increase our debt service obligations on our variable rate indebtedness would increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same and our net income and cash flows including cash available for servicing our indebtedness would correspondingly decrease assuming all loans were fully drawn we were to fully exercise our right to increase borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility and we made no prepayments on our 2019 term loan each quarter point change in interest rates would result in an approximately 18 million change in annual interest expense on our indebtedness under our revolving credit facility and 2019 term loan in the future we may enter into interest rate swaps that involve the exchange of floating for fixed rate interest payments in order to reduce interest rate volatility however we may not maintain interest rate swaps with respect to all of our variable rate indebtedness and any swaps we enter into may not fully mitigate our interest rate risk 

various factors could increase our future borrowing costs or reduce our access to capital including a lowering or withdrawal of the ratings assigned to our 2024 notes by rating agencies 

we may in the future seek additional financing for a variety of reasons and our future borrowing costs and access to capital could be affected by factors including the condition of the debt and equity markets the condition of the economy generally prevailing interest rates our level of indebtedness and our business and financial condition in addition the 2024 notes currently have an investment grade rating and any rating assigned could be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if in that rating agency’s judgment future circumstances relating to the basis of the rating such as adverse changes so warrant consequently real or anticipated changes in our credit ratings will generally affect the market value of the 2024 notes any future lowering of the ratings of the 2024 notes likely would make it more difficult or more expensive for us to obtain additional debt financing

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

  

the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k and with part i item 1a “risk factors” please refer to the cautionary language at the beginning of part i of this annual report on form 10k regarding forwardlooking statements 

business overview 

we continue to focus on executing our system design enablement strategy to deliver the tools necessary for our customers to develop complete and functional electronic products our growing core electronic design automation business is at the heart of our strategy and is complemented by our business in intellectual property system interconnect and analysis system level design and hardwaresoftware development 

our business serves customers that are driven by enduser demand for electronics systems integrated circuits and devices that are smaller use less power and provide more functionality we must keep pace with our customers’ technical developments satisfy industry standards and meet our customers’ increasingly demanding performance productivity quality and predictability requirements we offer innovative solutions to help our customers meet these demands and our future performance depends on our ability to innovate commercialize newly developed solutions and enhance and maintain our current products 

we have identified certain items that management uses as performance indicators to manage our business including revenue certain elements of operating expenses and cash flow from operations and we describe these items further below under the headings “results of operations” and “liquidity and capital resources” 

results of operations 

financial results for fiscal 2016  as compared to fiscal 2015  and 2014  reflect the following 

 our fiscal year ends on the saturday closest to december 31 fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015 were 52week years whereas fiscal 2014 was a 53week year revenue and expenses included in the results of operations for fiscal 2014 were impacted by the additional week 

revenue 

we primarily generate revenue from licensing our software and ip selling or leasing our emulation and prototyping hardware technology providing maintenance for our software hardware and ip providing engineering services and earning royalties generated from the use of our ip the timing of our revenue is significantly affected by the mix of software hardware and ip products generating revenue in any given period and whether the revenue is recognized in a recurring manner over multiple periods or up front upon completion of delivery 

 approximately 90 of our revenue is recurring in nature and the remainder of the resulting revenue is recognized up front upon completion of delivery recurring revenue includes revenue from our timebased software arrangements certain ip license arrangements where revenue is recognized over multiple periods services royalties from certain ip arrangements maintenance on perpetual software licenses and hardware and operating leases of hardware upfront revenue is primarily generated by our sales of emulation and prototyping hardware and perpetual software and certain ip licenses our ability to maintain this mix in any single fiscal period may be impacted primarily by delivery of hardware and ip products to our customers 

 for an additional description of the impact of emulation hardware sales on the timing of revenue recognition see the discussion under the heading “critical accounting estimates – revenue recognition” 

 we believe our reported revenue and the amount of revenue recognized in future periods will depend on among other things the 

 revenue by year 

the following table shows our revenue for fiscal 2016  2015  and 2014  and the change in revenue between years 



product and maintenance revenue increased during fiscal 2016  as compared to fiscal 2015  primarily because of an increase in revenue from our palladium z1 enterprise emulation system and our digital ic product offerings offset by a reduction in revenue from our ip offerings product and maintenance revenue increased during fiscal 2015  as compared to fiscal 2014  due to increased demand for our software emulation and prototyping hardware and ip offerings services revenue increased during fiscal 2016  as compared to fiscal 2015  primarily due to the timing of incremental revenue from certain customer agreements that was recognized at the completion of the contract when all specified deliverables were made available services revenue increased during fiscal 2015  as compared to fiscal 2014  due to increased demand for our service and ip offerings total revenue may fluctuate from period to period based on demand for and our resources to fulfill our services emulation hardware and ip offerings 

no one customer accounted for 10  or more of total revenue during fiscal 2016  2015  or 2014  

revenue by product group 

the following table shows the percentage of product and related maintenance revenue contributed by each of our five product groups and services during fiscal 2016  2015  and 2014  



as described in note 2 in the notes to consolidated financial statements certain of our licensing arrangements allow customers the ability to remix among software products additionally we have arrangements with customers that include a combination of our products with the actual product selection and number of licensed users to be determined at a later date for these arrangements we estimate the allocation of the revenue to product groups based upon the expected usage of our products the actual usage of our products by these customers may differ and if that proves to be the case the revenue allocation in the table above would differ 

  

revenue by geography 



for the primary factors contributing to the increase in revenue for the united states other americas asia and europe middle east and africa during fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015 see the general description under “revenue by year” above revenue for japan decreased during fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015 primarily due to difficult business conditions facing our japanese customers 

for the primary factors contributing to the increase in revenue for the united states other americas and asia during fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 see the general description under “revenue by year” above revenue for europe middle east and africa decreased during fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 primarily due to a reduction of services revenue as we shifted our resources from design services to our ip offerings revenue for japan decreased during fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 primarily due to the continued depreciation of the japanese yen as well as difficult business conditions facing our japanese customers 

most of our revenue is transacted in the united states dollar however certain revenue transactions are denominated in foreign currencies for an additional description of how changes in foreign exchange rates affect our consolidated financial statements see the discussion in item 7a “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk – foreign currency risk” 

revenue by geography as a percent of total revenue 



cost of revenue 

  

the following table shows cost of revenue as a percentage of related revenue for fiscal 2016  2015  and 2014  

  



cost of product and maintenance 

cost of product and maintenance includes costs associated with the sale and lease of our emulation and prototyping hardware and licensing of our software and ip products certain employee salary and benefits and other employeerelated costs cost of our customer support services amortization of technologyrelated and maintenancerelated acquired intangibles costs of technical documentation and royalties payable to thirdparty vendors costs associated with our emulation and prototyping hardware products include materials assembly applicable reserves and overhead these hardware manufacturing costs make our cost of emulation and prototyping hardware product higher as a percentage of revenue than our cost of software and ip products 

a summary of cost of product and maintenance for fiscal 2016  2015  and 2014  is as follows 

  

cost of product and maintenance depends primarily on our hardware product sales in any given period cost of product and maintenance is also affected by employee salary and benefits and other employeerelated costs as well as the timing and extent to which we acquire intangible assets acquire or license thirdparties’ intellectual property or technology and sell our products that include such acquired or licensed intellectual property or technology 

the changes in product and maintenancerelated costs were due to the following 



emulation and prototyping hardware costs increased during fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015 primarily due to higher emulation hardware volume and an increase in charges for reserves on inventory during fiscal 2016 as we approach the end of the product life cycle of palladium xp a previous generation of our palladium hardware platform emulation and prototyping hardware costs decreased during fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 primarily because charges for inventory reserves were higher during fiscal 2014 gross margins on our hardware products will fluctuate based on customer pricing strategies product mix product competition and product life cycle 

amortization of acquired intangibles included in cost of product and maintenance increased during fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015 primarily due to the increase in amortization of intangible assets associated with our fiscal 2016 acquisitions amortization of acquired intangibles included in cost of product and maintenance increased during fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 primarily due to the increase in amortization of intangible assets associated with our fiscal 2014 acquisitions for an additional description of our expected amortization of intangible assets see note 8 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

cost of services 

cost of services primarily includes employee salary benefits and other employeerelated costs to perform work on revenuegenerating projects costs to maintain the infrastructure necessary to manage a services organization and provisions for contract losses if any cost of services will fluctuate from period to period based on our utilization of design services engineers on revenuegenerating projects or on internal development projects cost of services decreased during fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015 and increased during fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 primarily due to variation in the number of personnel dedicated to deliver and support our services and custom ip offerings 

  operating expenses 

our operating expenses include marketing and sales research and development and general and administrative expenses factors that cause our operating expenses to fluctuate include changes in the number of employees due to hiring and acquisitions restructuring activities foreign exchange rates stockbased compensation and the impact of our variable compensation programs that are driven by overall operating results 

many of our operating expenses are transacted in various foreign currencies we recognize lower expenses in periods when the united states dollar strengthens in value against other currencies and we recognize higher expenses when the united states dollar weakens against other currencies during fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015 we experienced a favorable impact on expenses as a result of the strengthening value of the united states dollar against other currencies for an additional description of how changes in foreign exchange rates affect our consolidated financial statements see the discussion in item 7a “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk – foreign currency risk” 

our operating expenses for fiscal 2016  2015  and 2014  were as follows 



our operating expenses as a percentage of total revenue for fiscal 2016  2015  and 2014  were as follows 



  

marketing and sales 

the changes in marketing and sales expense were due to the following 



salary benefits and other employeerelated costs decreased during fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015 primarily due to headcount reductions within our sales organization 

research and development 

  the changes in research and development expense were due to the following 



costs included in research and development increased during fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015 primarily due to incremental investments in research and development as a result of additional hiring as well as headcount added from acquisitions in addition stockbased compensation included in research and development increased during fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015 and during fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 because successive increases in the price of our common stock during fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015 resulted in higher grantdate fair values for the mix of stock awards expensed in each of fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015 

general and administrative 

the changes in general and administrative expense were due to the following 



costs included in general and administrative increased during fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015 primarily due to increased headcount and merit adjustments for existing employees and costs associated with our fiscal 2016 acquisitions stockbased compensation included in general and administrative increased during fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015 and during fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 primarily because successive increases in the price of our common stock during fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015 resulted in higher grantdate fair values for the mix of stock awards expensed in each of fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015 

amortization of acquired intangibles 



the changes in amortization of acquired intangibles were due to the following 



restructuring and other charges 

we have initiated various restructuring plans in recent years to better align our resources with our business strategy because the restructuring charges and related benefits are derived from management’s estimates made during the formulation of the restructuring plans based on thencurrently available information our restructuring plans may not achieve the benefits anticipated on the timetable or at the level contemplated demand for our products and services and ultimately our future financial performance is difficult to predict with any degree of certainty accordingly additional actions including further restructuring of our operations may be required in the future 

the following table presents restructuring and other charges credits net for our restructuring plans 



for an additional description of our restructuring plans see note 12 in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

interest expense 

interest expense for fiscal 2016  2015  and 2014  was comprised of the following 



for an additional description of our debt arrangements see note 3 in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

income taxes 

the following table presents the provision for income taxes and the effective tax rate for fiscal 2016  2015  and 2014  



during fiscal 2016 we adopted a new accounting standard related to the accounting for stockbased compensation that requires all income tax effects of stockbased awards to be recognized in our consolidated income statement as the awards vest or are settled for further discussion regarding new accounting standards see note 2 in the notes to consolidated financial statements under the heading “recently adopted accounting standards” 

our foreign earnings are generally subject to lower statutory tax rates than our united states earnings 

our provision for income taxes for the fiscal year ended december 31 2016 is primarily attributable to federal state and foreign income taxes on our fiscal 2016 income and includes the tax benefit resulting from the permanent reinstatement of the united states research tax credit in december 2015 our provision for income taxes for the fiscal year ended december 31 2016 includes 172 million of tax benefit related to stockbased compensation that vested or settled during the period 

our provision for income taxes for the fiscal year ended january 2 2016 was primarily attributable to federal state and foreign income taxes on our fiscal 2015 income which was partially offset by 138 million  of tax benefit related to the effective settlement of a tax examination of a foreign subsidiary our provision for income taxes included a tax benefit of 101 million  resulting from the enactment of the united states research tax credit in december 2015 

our provision for income taxes for the fiscal year ended january 3 2015 primarily resulted from federal state and foreign income taxes on our fiscal 2014 income our provision for income taxes included a tax benefit of 81 million  resulting from the enactment of the united states research tax credit in december 2014 

our future effective tax rates may be materially impacted by tax amounts associated with our foreign earnings at rates different from the united states federal statutory rate research credits the tax impact of stockbased compensation accounting for uncertain tax positions business combinations closure of statutes of limitations or settlement of tax audits changes in valuation allowance and changes in tax law a significant amount of our foreign earnings is generated by our subsidiaries organized in ireland and hungary our future effective tax rates may be adversely affected if our earnings were to be lower in countries where we have lower statutory tax rates or if we were to repatriate certain foreign earnings on which united states taxes have not been previously accrued we currently expect that our fiscal 2017 effective tax rate will be similar to our fiscal 2016 effective tax rate for additional discussion about how our effective tax rate could be affected by various risks see part i item 1a “risk factors” 

for further discussion regarding our income taxes see note 10 in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

 liquidity and capital resources 



cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments 

as of december 31 2016  our principal sources of liquidity consisted of 4683 million  of cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments as compared to 7112 million  as of january 2 2016  

our primary sources of cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments during fiscal 2016  were cash generated from operations proceeds from borrowings proceeds from the sale and maturity of availableforsale securities proceeds from the exercise of stock options and proceeds from stock purchases under our employee stock purchase plan 

our primary uses of cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments during fiscal 2016  were payments related to salaries and benefits repurchases of our common stock other employeerelated costs and operating expenses payments on our revolving credit facility purchases of property plant and equipment acquisitions and tax payments 

 approximately 63  of our cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments were held by our foreign subsidiaries as of december 31 2016  our intent is to indefinitely reinvest our earnings from certain foreign operations we do not anticipate we will need to repatriate dividends from foreign operations that are indefinitely reinvested in order to fund our domestic operations in the event that dividends from foreign operations that are currently indefinitely reinvested are needed to fund united states liquidity we could be required to accrue and pay additional taxes in order to repatriate these funds for further discussion regarding our income taxes see note 10 in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

we expect that current cash cash equivalents and shortterm investment balances cash flows that are generated from operations and cash borrowings available under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to meet our domestic and international working capital needs and other capital and liquidity requirements including acquisitions and share repurchases for at least the next 12 months 

net working capital 

net working capital is comprised of current assets less current liabilities as shown on our consolidated balance sheets the decrease in our net working capital as of december 31 2016  as compared to january 2 2016  is primarily due to a net decrease in cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments resulting from financing activities including repurchases of our common stock 

cash flows from operating activities 

cash flows from operating activities during fiscal 2016  2015  and 2014  were as follows 



cash flows from operating activities include net income adjusted for certain noncash items as well as changes in the balances of certain assets and liabilities our cash flows from operating activities are significantly influenced by business levels and the payment terms set forth in our customer agreements 

the increase in cash flows from operating activities during fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015 was primarily due to the timing of cash receipts from customers and disbursements made to vendors the increase in cash flows from operating activities during fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 was primarily due to improved profitability and the timing of cash receipts from customers and disbursements made to vendors 

we expect that cash flows from operating activities will fluctuate in future periods due to a number of factors including our operating results the timing of our billings collections disbursements and tax payments 

cash flows from investing activities 

cash flows provided by used for investing activities during fiscal 2016  2015  and 2014  were as follows 



the increase in cash flows provided by investing activities during fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015 was primarily due to an increase in proceeds resulting from the sale and maturity of our availableforsale securities partially offset by an increase in cash used for business combinations and asset acquisitions the decrease in cash flows used for investing activities during fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 was primarily due to the decrease in cash paid for business combinations because we did not complete any acquisitions during fiscal 2015 we expect to continue our investing activities including purchasing property plant and equipment purchasing intangible assets business combinations purchasing software licenses and making longterm equity investments 

cash flows from financing activities 

cash flows provided by used for financing activities during fiscal 2016  2015  and 2014  were as follows 



the decrease in cash used for financing activities during fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015 was primarily due to proceeds from the 2019 term loan and our revolving credit facility and a decrease in payments made to settle outstanding borrowings offset by an increase in payments made to repurchase shares of our common stock the increase in cash used for financing activities during fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 was primarily due to payments made to settle the principal value of the 2015 notes and an increase in payments made to repurchase shares of our common stock 

on january 28 2016 we entered into a 3000 million   three year senior unsecured nonamortizing term loan facility due on january 28 2019 or the 2019 term loan with a group of lenders led by jpmorgan chase bank na as administrative agent the 2019 term loan is unsecured for additional information relating to the 2019 term loan see note 3 in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

our revolving credit facility with a group of lenders led by bank of america na as administrative agent provided for borrowings up to 2500 million  with the right to request increased capacity up to an additional 1500 million  upon the receipt of lender commitments for total maximum borrowings of 4000 million  as of december 31 2016  outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility were 500 million  this revolving credit facility was replaced by a new revolving credit facility on january 30 2017 as described below 

other factors affecting liquidity and capital resources 

2024 notes 

in october 2014 we issued 3500 million  aggregate principal amount of 4375  senior notes due october 15 2024 we received net proceeds of 3424 million  from the issuance of the 2024 notes net of a discount of 14 million  and issuance costs of 62 million  interest is payable in cash semiannually the 2024 notes are unsecured and rank equal in right of payment to all of our existing and future senior indebtedness the proceeds from the 2024 notes are available for general corporate purposes which may include the retirement of debt working capital capital expenditures acquisitions and strategic transactions 

revolving credit facility 

on january 30 2017 we entered into a fiveyear senior unsecured revolving credit facility with a group of lenders led by jpmorgan chase bank na as administrative agent which replaced our existing revolving credit facility the new credit facility provides for borrowings up to 3500 million with the right to request increased capacity up to an additional 2500 million upon the receipt of lender commitments for total maximum borrowings of 6000 million the credit facility expires on january 28 2022 and has no subsidiary guarantors any outstanding loans drawn under the credit facility are due at maturity on january 28 2022 outstanding borrowings may be paid at any time prior to maturity for additional information relating to our new revolving credit facility see note 20 in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

contractual obligations 

a summary of our contractual obligations as of december 31 2016  is as follows 



 

 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

as of december 31 2016  we did not have any significant offbalance sheet arrangements as defined in item 303a4ii of sec regulation sk 

critical accounting estimates 

in preparing our consolidated financial statements we make assumptions judgments and estimates that can have a significant impact on our revenue operating income and net income as well as on the value of certain assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets we base our assumptions judgments and estimates on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions at least quarterly we evaluate our assumptions judgments and estimates and make changes as deemed necessary 

we believe that the assumptions judgments and estimates involved in the accounting for income taxes revenue recognition business combinations intangible asset and goodwill impairments and fair value of financial instruments have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements therefore we consider these to be our critical accounting estimates for information on our significant accounting policies see note 2 in the notes to consolidated financial statements

we are subject to income taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our provision for these taxes there are many transactions that occur during the ordinary course of business for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain our provision for income taxes could be adversely affected by our earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries where we have higher statutory rates losses incurred in jurisdictions for which we are not able to realize the related tax benefit changes in foreign currency exchange rates entry into new businesses and geographies and changes to our existing businesses acquisitions and investments changes in our deferred tax assets and liabilities including changes in our assessment of valuation allowances changes in the relevant tax laws or interpretations of these tax laws and developments in current and future tax examinations 

we only recognize the tax benefit of an income tax position if we judge that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained solely on its technical merits in a tax audit including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes to make this judgment we must interpret complex and sometimes ambiguous tax laws regulations and administrative practices if we judge that an income tax position meets this recognition threshold then we must measure the amount of the tax benefit to be recognized by estimating the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50 cumulative probability of being realized upon settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all of the relevant facts it is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts as this requires us to determine the probability of various possible settlement outcomes we must reevaluate our income tax positions on a quarterly basis to consider factors such as changes in facts or circumstances changes in tax law effectively settled issues under audit the lapse of applicable statute of limitations and new audit activity such a change in recognition or measurement would result in recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision for a more detailed description of our unrecognized tax benefits see note 10 in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition 

we begin to recognize revenue when all of the following criteria are met 

 significant judgment is involved in the determination of whether the facts and circumstances of an arrangement support that the fee for the arrangement is considered to be fixed or determinable and that collectibility of the fee is probable and these judgments can affect the amount of revenue that we recognize in a particular reporting period for contracts that do not include a substantial upfront payment we consider a fee to be fixed or determinable if the arrangement has payment periods that are less than or equal to the term of the licenses and the payments are collected in equal or nearly equal installments when evaluated over the entire term of the arrangement if we no longer were to have a history of collecting under the original contract without providing concessions on timebased licenses revenue from such licenses would be required to be recognized when payments under the contract become due and payable such a change could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

we must also make judgments when assessing whether a contract amendment to a timebased arrangement primarily in the context of a license extension or renewal constitutes a concession we have established a history of collecting under contracts for which the fee has been assessed as fixed or determinable without providing concessions on payments products or services 

generally we are able to estimate whether collection is probable but significant judgment is applied as we assess the creditworthiness of our customers to make this determination key external and internal factors are considered in developing our creditworthiness assessment including public information historical and current financial statements and past collection history if our experience were to change it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations if in our judgment collection of a fee is not probable we do not record revenue until the uncertainty is removed which is generally upon receipt of cash payment 

revenue associated with our timebased licenses is recognized on a recurring basis over the term of the arrangement commencing upon the later of the effective date of the arrangement or delivery of the first software product in general product revenue associated with perpetual licenses where vendor specific objective evidence or vsoe exists for the undelivered maintenance is recognized up front upon the later of the effective date of the arrangement or delivery of the software product provided all other conditions for revenue recognition have been met and maintenance revenue is recognized ratably over the maintenance term if certain other criteria are met revenue for design ip is recognized upon delivery and we accrue the expected costs of maintenance a relatively small percentage of our revenue from software and ip licenses is recognized on an upfront basis 

our hardware products generally include the hardware product and its related essential software and maintenance for the hardware and the essential software consideration allocated to the hardware product and the essential software is recognized as revenue at the time of delivery provided all other conditions for revenue recognition have been met consideration allocated to the maintenance is recognized ratably over the maintenance term 

revenue from services and customized ip arrangements is recognized either on the time and materials method as work is performed or on the percentageofcompletion method if a service contract is considered to be part of a multiple element arrangement or mea that includes a software contract revenue is generally recognized on a recurring basis over the duration of the software contract for contracts with fixed or nottoexceed fees we estimate on a monthly basis the percentage of completion based on the completion of milestones relating to the arrangement we have a history of accurately estimating project status and the costs necessary to complete projects a number of internal and external factors can affect our estimates including labor rates utilization and efficiency variances and specification and testing requirement changes if different conditions were to prevail such that accurate estimates could not be made then the use of the completed contract method would be required and the recognition of all revenue and costs would be deferred until the project was completed such a change could have a material impact on our results of operations 

if a group of contracts is so closely related that they are in effect part of a single arrangement such arrangements are deemed to be an mea we exercise significant judgment to evaluate the relevant facts and circumstances in determining whether the separate contracts should be accounted for individually as distinct arrangements or whether the separate contracts are in substance an mea our judgments about whether a group of contracts is an mea can affect the timing of revenue recognition under those contracts which could have an effect on our results of operations for the periods involved for example a perpetual license agreement that would otherwise result in upfront revenue upon delivery may be deemed part of an mea when it is executed within close proximity or in contemplation of other license agreements that require recurring revenue recognition with the same customer in which event all the revenue is recognized over the longest term of any component of the mea instead of up front 

for an mea that includes software and nonsoftware elements we allocate consideration to all software elements as a group and all nonsoftware elements based on their relative standalone selling prices revenue allocated to each deliverable is then recognized when all four criteria are met in these circumstances there is a hierarchy to determine the standalone selling price to be used for allocating consideration to the deliverables as follows 

 we calculate the besp of our hardware products based on our pricing practices including the historical average prices charged for comparable hardware products because vsoe or tpe cannot be established our process for determining besp for our software deliverables without vsoe or tpe takes into account multiple factors that vary depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each deliverable key external and internal factors considered in developing the besps include prices charged by us for similar arrangements historical pricing practices and the nature of the product in addition when developing besps we may consider other factors as appropriate including the pricing of competitive alternatives if they exist and productspecific business objectives we exercise significant judgment to evaluate the relevant facts and circumstances in calculating the besp of the deliverables in our arrangements 

business combinations 

when we acquire businesses we allocate the purchase price to the acquired tangible assets and assumed liabilities including deferred revenue liabilities associated with the fair value of contingent consideration and acquired identifiable intangible assets any residual purchase price is recorded as goodwill the allocation of the purchase price requires us to make significant estimates in determining the fair values of these acquired assets and assumed liabilities especially with respect to intangible assets and goodwill these estimates are based on information obtained from management of the acquired companies our assessment of this information and historical experience these estimates can include but are not limited to the cash flows that an acquired business is expected to generate in the future the cash flows that specific assets acquired with that business are expected to generate in the future the appropriate weightedaverage cost of capital and the cost savings expected to be derived from acquiring an asset these estimates are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and if different estimates were used the purchase price for the acquisition could be allocated to the acquired assets and assumed liabilities differently from the allocation that we have made to the acquired assets and assumed liabilities in addition unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that may affect the accuracy or validity of such estimates and if such events occur we may be required to adjust the value allocated to acquired assets or assumed liabilities 

we also make significant judgments and estimates when we assign useful lives to the definitelived intangible assets identified as part of our acquisitions these estimates are inherently uncertain and if we used different estimates the useful life over which we amortize intangible assets would be different in addition unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that may impact the useful life assigned to our intangible assets which would impact our amortization of intangible assets expense and our results of operations 

fair value of financial instruments 

on a quarterly basis we measure at fair value certain financial assets and liabilities inputs to valuation techniques are observable or unobservable observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources while unobservable inputs reflect our market assumptions 

while we believe the observable and unobservable inputs we use to measure the fair value are reasonable different inputs or estimates may materially impact the resulting fair value measurements of these instruments and may also impact our results of operations for an additional description of our fair value measurements see note 16 in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

new accounting standards 

revenue recognition 

in may 2014 the fasb issued a new standard related to revenue recognition under the new standard revenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services and is recognized in an amount that reflects the consideration which the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services in addition the standard requires disclosure of the nature amount timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers the fasb has recently issued several amendments to the standard including clarification on accounting for licenses of intellectual property and identifying performance obligations 

the new standard will be effective for us beginning the first quarter of fiscal 2018 the guidance permits two methods of adoption retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented full retrospective method or modified retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying the guidance recognized at the date of initial application the cumulative catchup transition method 

while we continue to assess all potential impacts of the standard our preliminary assessment is that we expect to continue to recognize revenue for our timebased software arrangements over time which represents a significant percentage of our total revenue this preliminary assessment is based on the conclusion that the multiple software licenses and related updates in our timebased arrangements constitute a single combined performance obligation the timing of revenue recognition for our hardware and professional services is expected to remain substantially unchanged 

we currently believe the most significant impact of the adoption of this new standard relates to our accounting for multiple element arrangements or meas that combine many softwarerelated deliverables which may include multiple software contracts with varying terms ip licenses andor service elementsusing the current accounting guidance that requires vendorspecific objective evidence or vsoe to recognize revenue separately for the different software elements the revenue related to these meas is generally recognized over time beginning with the delivery of the last specified deliverable and ending on the latest end date for example under the current accounting guidance an mea that included a perpetual ip license delivered at contract execution with 12 months of maintenance and a 36month timebased software contract would all be recognized over the 36month term of the software contract under the new standard amounts will be allocated to each of the performance obligations and the related revenue will be recognized as each performance obligation is fulfilled in the example above an amount would be allocated to the ip the maintenance and the timebased software contract and those respective revenue amounts would be recognized upon delivery of the ip over the 12month maintenance term and over the 36month timebased software term 

the allocation of revenue for each performance obligation noted above is determined based on the standalone selling price or ssp of each performance obligation more judgment and estimates will be required within the revenue recognition process than are required under current gaap including estimating the ssp for each performance obligation identified within our contracts we are currently performing analyses to determine the ssp for each of the performance obligations that have been identified in addition we are currently implementing systems and processes to assist in the adoption of this new accounting standard we currently anticipate adopting the standard using the cumulative catchup transition method 

financial instruments 

in january 2016 the fasb issued a new accounting standard that will impact certain aspects of recognition measurement presentation and disclosure of financial instruments the updated standard is effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 and early adoption is permitted we are currently evaluating the effect the updated standard will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures 

leases 

in february 2016 the fasb issued a new accounting standard requiring among other things the recognition of lease liabilities and corresponding rightofuse assets on the balance sheet by lessees for certain lease arrangements that are classified as operating leases under the previous standard the updated standard is effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 with early adoption permitted and requires the use of a modified retrospective approach for leases that exist or are entered into after the beginning of the earliest comparative period in the financial statements we anticipate that the adoption of this standard will have a material effect on our consolidated balance sheets and may require changes to our systems and processes we have not yet made any decision on the timing of adoption 

income tax 

in october 2016 the fasb issued a new accounting standard that will amend the accounting for income taxes on intraentity transfers of assets other than inventory the new guidance requires the recognition of the income tax consequences of an intraentity asset transfer when the transfer occurs for intraentity transfers of inventory the income tax effects will continue to be deferred until the inventory has been sold to a third party the new standard is effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 and early adoption is permitted the new guidance is required to be applied on a modified retrospective basis through a cumulativeeffect adjustment directly to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption we are currently evaluating the effects if any that the adoption of this guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements 

business combinations 

in january 2017 the fasb issued a new accounting standard that revises the definition of a business as it relates to acquisitions disposals goodwill impairments and consolidations the updated standard is effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 and early adoption is permitted we are currently evaluating the effect of adopting the new standard 

goodwill impairment 

in january 2017 the fasb issued a new accounting standard that simplifies the required test of goodwill for impairment by eliminating “step 2” from the goodwill impairment test the new standard is effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 and early adoption is permitted the new guidance is required to be applied on a prospective basis we do not anticipate that the adoption of this standard will have have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements or the related disclosures 

for information regarding new accounting standards adopted during fiscal 2016 see note 2 in the notes to consolidated financial statements under the heading “recently adopted accounting standards” 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

foreign currency risk 

a material portion of our revenue expenses and business activities are transacted in the us dollar in certain foreign countries where we price our products and services in us dollars a decrease in value of the local currency relative to the us dollar results in an increase in the prices for our products and services compared to those products of our competitors that are priced in local currency this could result in our prices being uncompetitive in certain markets 

in certain countries where we may invoice customers in the local currency our revenues benefit from a weaker dollar and are adversely affected by a stronger dollar the opposite impact occurs in countries where we record expenses in local currencies in those cases our costs and expenses benefit from a stronger dollar and are adversely affected by a weaker dollar the fluctuations in our operating expenses outside the united states resulting from volatility in foreign exchange rates are not generally moderated by corresponding fluctuations in revenues from existing contracts 

we enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to protect against currency exchange risks associated with existing assets and liabilities a foreign currency forward exchange contract acts as a hedge by increasing in value when underlying assets decrease in value or underlying liabilities increase in value due to changes in foreign exchange rates conversely a foreign currency forward exchange contract decreases in value when underlying assets increase in value or underlying liabilities decrease in value due to changes in foreign exchange rates these forward contracts are not designated as accounting hedges so the unrealized gains and losses are recognized in other income net in advance of the actual foreign currency cash flows with the fair value of these forward contracts being recorded as accrued liabilities or other current assets 

we do not use forward contracts for trading purposes our forward contracts generally have maturities of 90 days or less we enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts based on estimated future asset and liability exposures and the effectiveness of our hedging program depends on our ability to estimate these future asset and liability exposures recognized gains and losses with respect to our current hedging activities will ultimately depend on how accurately we are able to match the amount of foreign currency forward exchange contracts with actual underlying asset and liability exposures 

the following table provides information about our foreign currency forward exchange contracts as of december 31 2016  the information is provided in united states dollar equivalent amounts the table presents the notional amounts at contract exchange rates and the weighted average contractual foreign currency exchange rates expressed as units of the foreign currency per united states dollar which in some cases may not be the market convention for quoting a particular currency all of these forward contracts mature before or during february 2017  



we actively monitor our foreign currency risks but there is no guarantee that our foreign currency hedging activities will substantially offset the impact of fluctuations in currency exchange rates on our results of operations cash flows and financial position 

interest rate risk 

our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our portfolio of marketable debt securities our portfolio of cash and cash equivalents and outstanding balances drawn on our revolving credit facility if any 

we are exposed to interest rate fluctuations in many of the world’s leading industrialized countries but the fair value of our marketable debt securities and our interest income and expense is most sensitive to fluctuations in the general level of united states interest rates in this regard changes in united states interest rates affect the interest earned on our marketable debt securities and cash and cash equivalents any unrealized and realized gains or losses on our marketable debt securities and the costs associated with foreign currency hedges pursuant to our investment policy we limit the amount of our credit exposure to any one issuer other than in securities issued by the united states treasury and united states government agencies 

all highly liquid securities with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase are considered to be cash equivalents securities with maturities greater than three months are classified as availableforsale and are considered to be shortterm investments the carrying value of our interestbearing instruments approximated fair value as of december 31 2016  

interest rates under our revolving credit facility and 2019 term loan are variable so interest expense could be adversely affected by changes in interest rates particularly for periods when we maintain an outstanding balance under the revolving credit facility interest rates for our revolving credit facility and 2019 term loan can fluctuate based on changes in market interest rates and in an interest rate margin that varies based on our consolidated leverage ratio as of december 31 2016  we had a 500 million  outstanding balance under our revolving credit facility for additional description of this revolving credit facility see note 3 in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

equity price risk 

equity investments 

we have a portfolio of equity investments that includes marketable equity securities and nonmarketable investments our equity investments are made primarily in connection with our strategic investment program under our strategic investment program from time to time we make cash investments in companies with technologies that are potentially strategically important to us see note 4 in the notes to consolidated financial statements for an additional description of these investments our nonmarketable investments had a carrying value of 32 million  as of december 31 2016  and 39 million  as of january 2 2016  




 item 9 changes in and disagreements with accountants on accounting and financial disclosure 

none 




 item 9a controls and procedures 

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

as required by rule 13a15 of the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended or the exchange act under the supervision and with the participation of our management including our chief executive officer or ceo and our chief financial officer or cfo we evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rules 13a15e and 15d15e under the exchange act as of december 31 2016  

the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures included a review of our processes and the effect on the information generated for use in this annual report on form 10k in the course of this evaluation we sought to identify any material weaknesses in our disclosure controls and procedures to determine whether we had identified any acts of fraud involving personnel who have a significant role in our disclosure controls and procedures and to confirm that any necessary corrective action including process improvements was taken this type of evaluation is done every fiscal quarter so that our conclusions concerning the effectiveness of these controls can be reported in our periodic reports filed with the sec the overall goals of these evaluation activities are to monitor our disclosure controls and procedures and to make modifications as necessary we intend to maintain these disclosure controls and procedures modifying them as circumstances warrant 

based on their evaluation as of december 31 2016  our ceo and cfo have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by us in our reports filed or submitted under the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the sec’s rules and forms and is accumulated and communicated to our management including the ceo and cfo as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure 

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the fiscal quarter ended december 31 2016  that materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting 

inherent limitations on effectiveness of controls 

our management including our ceo and cfo does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud internal control over financial reporting no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of internal control are met further the design of internal control must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of the control must be considered relative to their costs while our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance of their effectiveness because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within cadence have been detected 

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rule 13a15f under the exchange act our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2016  in making this assessment our management used the criteria established in internal controlintegrated framework 2013 issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission or coso our management has concluded that as of december 31 2016  our internal control over financial reporting is effective based on these criteria our independent registered public accounting firm kpmg llp has issued an attestation report on our internal control over financial reporting which is included in part iv item 15 “exhibits and financial statement schedules”

the eda and ip industries as drivers for our business 

our system design enablement strategy is to deliver the technologies necessary for integrated system and systemonchip or soc design with an end product in mind at the heart of this strategy is our growing core eda business which is complemented by our expanding businesses in ip system interconnect and analysis system level design and hardwaresoftware development 

our customers commence new design projects based on enduser demand for electronics systems ics and devices that are smaller use less power and provide more functionality to meet this demand our customers design and develop new ics and electronic devices and systems using our products and services 

the markets our customers serve are sensitive to end product price performance and the time it takes to bring their products to market in order to be competitive and profitable in these markets our customers demand high levels of productivity from their design teams better predictability in shorter development schedules high performance products and lower development and manufacturing costs semiconductor and electronics systems companies are responding to these challenges and users’ demand for increased functionality and smaller devices by combining subsystems such as radio frequency or rf wireless communication signal processing microprocessors and memory controllers onto a single silicon chip creating a soc or combining multiple chips into a single chip package in a format referred to as systeminpackage or sip the trend toward subsystem integration has required these chip makers to find solutions to challenges previously addressed by system companies such as verifying systemlevel functionality and hardwaresoftware interoperability and has driven the need for incorporation of preverified commercial ip into these systems in addition whole systems must be designed and verified made up of many component socs and software and must be analyzed for performance in enduser operating scenarios 

significant issues that our customers face in creating their products include designing and verifying whole systems including software reducing power consumption manufacturing microscopic circuitry verifying device functionality and achieving technical performance targets all while meeting aggressive timetomarket and cost requirements we must deliver products that address these technical challenges while improving the productivity predictability reliability and profitability of the design processes and products of their customers

ip 

our design ip offerings consist of preverified customizable functional blocks which customers integrate into their socs to accelerate the development process and to reduce the risk of errors in the design process we offer many types of design ip including tensilica ®  configurable digital signal processors or dsps vertically targeted subsystems for audiovoice baseband and videoimaging applications controllers and physical interfaces or phys for standard protocols and analog ip we significantly expanded our design ip portfolio in recent years through acquisitions and internal development 

we also offer a broad range of vip and memory models which model the expected behavior of many industry standard protocols when used with verification solutions and are complementary to our design ip offerings our vip offerings are also used in systemlevel verification to model correct behavior of full systems interacting with their environments 

product arrangements 

we license software and ip using three license types term subscription and perpetual we seek to achieve a consistent revenue mix such that approximately 90 of our revenue is recurring in nature and the remainder of the resulting revenue is recognized up front upon completion of delivery customers who prefer to license technology for a specified limited period of time will choose either a term or subscription license and customers who prefer to have the right to use the technology continuously without time restriction will choose a perpetual license customers who desire to use new software technology during the life of the contract will select a subscription license which allows them limited access to unspecified new technology on a whenandifavailable basis as opposed to a term or perpetual license which does not include the right to use new technology payment terms for term and subscription licenses generally provide for payments to be made over the license period and payment terms for perpetual licenses generally are net 30 days 

our emulation and prototyping hardware products are either sold or leased to our customers 

we generally license our design ip under nonexclusive license agreements that provide usage rights for specific designs in addition for certain of our ip license agreements we collect royalties as our customers ship their product that includes our ip to their customers 

for a further description of our license agreements our emulation and prototyping hardware sale or lease agreements revenue recognition policies and results of operations please refer to the discussion under “critical accounting estimates” under part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” 

technical support and maintenance 

customer service and support is critical to the adoption and successful use of our products we provide our customers with technical support and maintenance to facilitate their use of our software hardware and ip solutions 

services 

we offer a number of services including services related to methodology and education and hosted design solutions these services may be sold separately or sold and performed in conjunction with the license sale or lease of our products as necessary certain of our design services engineers are assigned to internal research and development projects associated with our design ip business 

as part of our services offerings we design advanced ics develop custom ip and address industry design issues that may not be solved adequately by today’s eda technologies this enables us to target and accelerate the development of new software technology and products to satisfy current and future design requirements 

we offer engineering services to collaborate with our customers in the design of complex ics and the implementation of key design capabilities including low power design ic packaging and board design functional verification digital implementation analogmixedsignal design and systemlevel design the customers for these services primarily consist of semiconductor and systems companies developing products for the consumer communications military aerospace and computing markets these ics range from digital socs and analog and rf designs to complex mixedsignal ics 

in delivering methodology services we leverage our experience and knowledge of design techniques our products leading practices and different design environments to improve the productivity of our customers’ engineering teams depending on the customers’ projects and needs we work with customers using outsourcing consultative and collaborative offerings 

our hosted design solutions enable us to deliver softwareasaservice or saas to those customers who do not have their own infrastructure they also enable our engineering teams at one or more of our locations to assist our customers’ teams located elsewhere in the world during the course of their design and engineering projects through a secure network infrastructure 

our education services offerings can be customized and include training programs that are conducted via the internet or in a classroom setting the content of these offerings ranges from the latest ic design techniques to methodologies for using the most recent features of our eda products the primary focus of education services is to accelerate our customers’ path to productivity in the use of our products 

thirdparty programs and initiatives 

in addition to our products many customers use design tools that are provided by other eda companies as well as design ip available from multiple suppliers we support the use of thirdparty design products and design ip through our connections ®  program and through our participation in industry groups such as the silicon integration initiative or si2 and accellera system initiative we actively contribute to the development and deployment of industry standards 

product and maintenance and services revenue 

revenue and revenue as a percentage of total revenue from our product and maintenance and services offerings for the last three fiscal years were as follows 



for an additional description of our product and maintenance and services revenue see the discussion under “results of operations” under part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” for our fiscal 2015 results of operations and our financial position as of january 2 2016  see part iv item 15 “exhibits and financial statement schedules” 

backlog 

our backlog was approximately  23 billion  and 21 billion  as of january 2 2016  and january 3 2015  respectively our backlog as of january 2 2016  consisted of fully executed arrangements with effective dates commencing no later than january 2 2016  with revenue to be recognized thereafter and included a variety of types generally including but not limited to 

 5 

the substantial majority of our backlog consists of customer contracts for which product and maintenance revenue is recognized ratably or on a recurring basis over the contract life historically we have not experienced significant cancellations of our contracts with customers for engineering services contracts in backlog completion dates are occasionally rescheduled delaying revenue recognition under those contracts beyond the original anticipated completion date changes in customer license types or payment terms also can affect the timing of revenue recognition during fiscal 2015  approximately 70  of our revenue came from arrangements that were in backlog as of january 3 2015  we expect approximately 13 billion  or approximately 70  of our fiscal 2016 revenue to come from arrangements that were in backlog as of january 2 2016  the actual percentage of revenue coming from backlog during fiscal 2016 may change if our actual business levels in fiscal 2016 are different than our current expectations 

marketing and sales 

we generally market our products and provide services to existing and prospective customers through a direct sales force consisting of sales people and applications engineers applications engineers provide technical presales and postsales support for our products due to the complexity of many of our products and the system design process the sales cycle is generally long requiring three to six months or more during the sales cycle our direct sales force generally provides technical presentations product demonstrations and support for onsite customer evaluation of our solutions we also promote our products and services through advertising marketing automation trade shows public relations and the internet we selectively utilize valueadded resellers to broaden our reach and reduce cost of sales our orcad products and certain allegro products are primarily marketed through these channels with respect to international sales we generally market and support our products and services through our subsidiaries we also use a thirdparty distributor to sell our products and services to certain customers in japan 

research and development 

our research and development expense was 6376 million  during fiscal 2015  6030 million  during fiscal 2014  and 5340 million  during fiscal 2013  

the primary areas of our research and development include the following 

 our future performance depends on our ability to innovate commercialize newly developed solutions and enhance and maintain our current products we must keep pace with our customers’ technical developments satisfy industry standards and meet our customers’ increasingly demanding performance productivity quality and predictability requirements therefore we expect to continue to invest in research and development 

hardware manufacturing and software distribution 

we perform final system integration and testing of our emulation and prototyping hardware products at our headquarters in san jose california subcontractors manufacture assemble and test certain major subassemblies including all individual pcbs and custom ics and supply them for qualification and testing before their incorporation into the integrated product all assembly system integration and testing of our fieldprogrammable gate array or fpga based prototyping products is done by our manufacturing partners 

software and documentation are primarily distributed to customers by secure electronic delivery or on dvd 

proprietary technology 

our success depends in part upon our proprietary technology we generally rely on patents copyrights trademarks and trade secret laws licenses and restrictive agreements to establish and protect our proprietary rights in technology and products many of our products include software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties we may have to seek new licenses or renew existing licenses for thirdparty software and other intellectual property in the future as part of performing engineering services for customers our engineering services business uses certain software and other intellectual property licensed from third parties including that of our competitors 

competition 

we compete in eda most frequently with synopsys inc and mentor graphics corporation but also with numerous other eda providers such as ansys inc atoptech inc zuken ltd and others offering “point solutions” with manufacturers of electronic devices that have developed acquired or have the capability to develop their own eda products and with numerous electronics design and consulting companies in the area of design ip we compete with synopsys inc ceva inc and numerous other ip companies 

certain competitive factors in the engineering services business differ from those of the products businesses while we compete with other eda companies in the engineering services business our principal competitors include independent engineering service businesses many of these companies are also customers and therefore use our product offerings in the delivery of their services or products 

international operations 

as of january 2 2016  we had 54  sales offices design centers and research and development facilities approximately 70  of which are located outside of the united states we primarily consider customer sales and support requirements the availability of a skilled workforce and costs and efficiencies among other relative benefits when determining what operations to locate internationally for additional information relating to our international operations including revenue and longlived assets by geographic area see note 19 in the notes to consolidated financial statements for risks related to our international operations see the discussion under “the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations may adversely impact our financial condition” and “risks associated with our international operations could seriously harm our financial condition”   under item 1a “risk factors” 

employees 

as of january 2 2016  we employed approximately 6700  people

 item 1a risk factors 

our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties including those described in the sections below that could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations cash flows and the trading price of our common stock 

risks related to our business 

uncertainty in the global economy in general and any potential downturn in the semiconductor and electronics industries in particular may negatively impact our business and reduce our bookings levels and revenue 

purchases of our products and services are dependent upon the commencement of new design projects by ic manufacturers and electronics systems companies the ic and electronics systems industries are cyclical and are characterized by constant and rapid technological change rapid product obsolescence and price erosion evolving standards short product life cycles and wide fluctuations in product supply and demand 

the ic and electronics systems industries have also experienced significant downturns in connection with or in anticipation of maturing product cycles of both these industries’ and their customers’ products while spending on eda products and services has grown in recent years the current outlook for the semiconductor industry is uncertain and may result in a decrease in spending on eda products and services 

while we cannot predict global economic conditions including for example an economic slowdown in china uncertainty about future economic conditions and future decline in consumer spending could negatively impact our customers’ businesses reducing the number of new chip designs and their overall research and development spending including their spending on eda products and services and as a result decrease demand for our products decreased bookings for our products and services customer bankruptcies consolidation among our customers or problems or delays with our hardware suppliers or with the supply or delivery of our hardware products could also adversely affect our ability to grow our business or adversely affect our future revenues and financial results our future business and financial results are subject to considerable uncertainty that could impact our stock price if economic conditions deteriorate in the future or in particular if semiconductor or electronics systems industry revenues do not grow or our suppliers of our hardware components and products are subject to problems or delays our future revenues and financial results could be adversely affected however if economic conditions improve for our customers the positive impact on our revenues and financial results may be deferred due to cautious customer research and development spending and our mix of licenses that result in recurring revenue 

customer consolidation could affect our operating results 

there has been a trend toward customer consolidation in our industry through business combinations including mergers asset acquisitions and strategic partnerships to the extent this trend continues it could make us dependent on fewer customers who may be able to exert increased pressure on our prices and other contract terms and could increase the portion of our total sales concentration for any single customer customer consolidation activity could also reduce the demand for our products and services if such customers streamline research and development or operations reduce purchases or delay purchasing decisions these outcomes could negatively impact our financial condition 

our failure to respond quickly to technological developments or customers’ increasing technological requirements could make our products uncompetitive and obsolete 

the industries in which we compete experience rapid technology developments rapid changes in industry standards and customer requirements and frequent introductions and improvements of new products currently the industries we serve are experiencing the following trends 

 9 

 if we are unable to respond quickly and successfully to these trends we may lose our competitive position and our products or technologies may become obsolete to compete successfully we must develop acquire or license new products and improve our existing products and processes on a schedule that keeps pace with technological developments and the requirements for products addressing a broad spectrum of designers and designer expertise in our industries the market must also accept our new and improved products our hardware platforms must be enhanced periodically to reduce the likelihood that a competitor surpasses the capabilities we offer our introduction of new products could reduce the demand and revenue of our older products or affect their pricing we must also be able to support a range of changing computer software hardware platforms and customer preferences a rapid transition to different business models associated with cloud computing technologies could result in reduced revenue we cannot guarantee that we will be successful in keeping pace with all or any of the customer trends 

we have experienced varied operating results and our operating results for any particular fiscal period are affected by the timing of revenue recognition particularly for our emulation and prototyping hardware and ip products 

various factors affect our operating results and some of them are not within our control our operating results for any period are affected by the timing of revenue recognition particularly for our emulation and prototyping hardware and ip products in addition we have recorded net losses in the past and may record net losses in the future 

a substantial portion of the product revenue related to our hardware business and some of our ip offerings is recognized upon delivery and our forecasted revenue results are based in part on our expectations of hardware and ip to be delivered in a particular quarter therefore changes in hardware and ip bookings or deliveries relative to expectations will have a more immediate impact on our revenue than changes in software or services bookings for which revenue is generally recognized over time 

in recent years we made significant investments to expand our ip offerings through among other things research and development and acquisitions as we continue to expand our ip offerings a portion of the revenue related to our ip bookings will be deferred until we complete and deliver the licensed ip to our customers as a result costs related to the research and development of the ip may be incurred prior to the recognition of the related revenue 

revenue related to our hardware and ip products is inherently difficult to predict because sales of our hardware and ip products depend on the commencement of new projects for the design and development of complex ics and systems by our customers our customers’ willingness to expend capital to deploy our hardware or ip products in those projects and the availability of our hardware or ip products for delivery therefore our hardware or ip sales may be delayed or may decrease if our customers delay or cancel projects because their spending is constrained or if there are problems or delays with the supply or delivery of our hardware or ip products or our hardware suppliers moreover the hardware and ip markets are highly competitive and our customers may choose to purchase a competitor’s hardware or ip product based on cost performance or other factors these factors may result in lower revenue which would have an adverse effect on our business results of operations or cash flows 

our software license mix is such that a substantial proportion of licenses require ratable revenue recognition and we expect the license mix combined with the modest growth in spending by our customers in the semiconductor sector may make it difficult for us to rapidly increase our revenue in future fiscal periods the timing of our revenue recognition may be deferred until payments become due and payable from customers with nonlinear payment terms or as cash is collected from customers with low credit ratings 

we plan our operating expenses based on forecasted revenue expected business needs and other factors these expenses and the effect of longterm commitments are relatively fixed in the short term bookings and the related revenue are harder to forecast in a difficult economic environment if we experience a shortfall in bookings our operating results could differ from our expectations because we may not be able to quickly reduce our expenses in response to shortterm business changes 

the methods estimates and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies have a significant impact on our results of operations see “critical accounting estimates” under part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” such methods estimates and judgments are by their nature subject to substantial risks uncertainties and assumptions and factors may arise over time that may lead us to change our methods estimates and judgments changes in those methods estimates and judgments could significantly affect our results of operations 

historical results of operations should not be viewed as reliable indicators of our future performance if our revenue operating results or business outlook for future periods fall short of the levels expected by us securities analysts or investors the trading price of our common stock could decline 

competitive pressures may require us to change our pricing which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

the highly competitive markets in which we do business can put pressure on us to reduce the prices of our software emulation and prototyping hardware and ip if our competitors offer deep discounts on certain products in an effort to recapture or gain market share or to sell other software or hardware products we may then need to lower our prices or offer other favorable terms to compete successfully any such changes would be likely to reduce our profit margins and could adversely affect our operating results any substantial changes to our prices and pricing policies could cause sales revenues to decline or be delayed as our sales force implements and our customers adjust to the new pricing policies some of our competitors bundle products for promotional purposes or as a longterm pricing strategy or provide guarantees of prices and product implementations these practices could over time significantly constrain the prices that we can charge for our products if we cannot offset price reductions with a corresponding increase in the number of sales or with lower spending then the reduced revenues resulting from lower prices could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

we depend on sole suppliers for certain hardware components and contract manufacturers for production of our emulation and prototyping hardware products making us vulnerable to supply disruption and price fluctuation 

we depend on sole suppliers for certain hardware components and contract manufacturers for production of our emulation and prototyping hardware products our reliance on sole suppliers and contract manufacturers could result in product delivery problems and delays and reduced control over product pricing and quality though we prefer to have multiple sources to procure certain key components in some cases it is not practical or feasible to do so we may suffer a disruption in the supply of certain hardware components if we are unable to purchase sufficient components on a timely basis or at all for any reason any supply or manufacturing disruption including delay in delivery of components by our suppliers or products by our manufacturers or the bankruptcy or shutdown of our suppliers or manufacturers could delay our production process and prevent us from delivering completed hardware products to customers or from supplying new evaluation units to customers which could have a negative impact on our revenue and operating results 

we have acquired and expect to acquire other companies and businesses and may not realize the expected benefits of these acquisitions 

we have acquired and expect to acquire other companies and businesses during the past few years we acquired multiple businesses in order to expand our ip business and other product offerings our future revenue growth and expansion of our business is dependent on our successful integration of our acquisitions we may incur significant costs in connection with potential transactions including acquisitions that are not consummated potential and completed acquisitions involve a number of risks if any of the following acquisitionrelated risks occur our business operating results or financial condition could be adversely impacted 

 11 

in a number of our completed acquisitions we have agreed to make future payments either in the form of employee retention bonuses or contingent purchase price payments based on the performance of the acquired companies businesses or the employees who joined us with the acquired companies or businesses the performance goals pursuant to which these future payments may be made generally relate to the achievement by the acquired company or business or by the employees who joined us with the acquired company or business of certain specified bookings revenue run rate product proliferation product development or employee retention goals during a specified period following completion of the applicable acquisition the specific performance goal levels and amounts and timing of employee bonuses or contingent purchase price payments vary with each acquisition we may continue to use contingent purchase price payments in connection with acquisitions in the future and while we expect to derive value from an acquisition in excess of such contingent payment obligations we may be required to make certain contingent payments without deriving the anticipated value 

future acquisitions may involve issuances of stock as full or partial payment of the purchase price for the acquired company or business grants of restricted stock restricted stock units or stock options to employees of the acquired companies or businesses which may be dilutive to existing stockholders expenditure of substantial cash resources or the incurrence of a material amount of debt these arrangements may impact our liquidity financial position and results of operations or increase dilution of our stockholders’ equity interests in the company 

we have invested and expect to continue to invest in research and development efforts for new and existing products and technologies and technical sales support such investments may affect our operating results and if the return on these investments is lower or develops more slowly than we expect our revenue and operating results may suffer 

we have invested and expect to continue to invest in research and development for new and existing products technologies and services in response to our customers’ increasing technological requirements such as the migration to advanced process nodes and the introduction of finfets such investments may be in related areas such as technical sales support these investments may involve significant time risks and uncertainties including the risk that the expenses associated with these investments may affect our margins and operating results and that such investments may not generate sufficient revenues to offset liabilities assumed and expenses associated with these new investments we believe that we must continue to invest a significant amount of time and resources in our research and development efforts and technical sales support to maintain and improve our competitive position if we do not achieve the benefits anticipated from these investments or if the achievement of these benefits is delayed our revenue and operating results may be adversely affected 

the competition in our industries is substantial and we may not be able to continue to successfully compete in our industries 

the eda industry the commercial electronics engineering services industry and the ip industry are highly competitive if we fail to compete successfully in these industries it could seriously harm our business operating results or financial condition to compete in these industries we must identify and develop or acquire innovative and costcompetitive eda products integrate them into platforms and market them in a timely manner we may not be able to compete successfully in these industries factors that could affect our ability to compete successfully include 

 we compete in eda most frequently with synopsys inc and mentor graphics corporation but also with numerous other eda providers such as ansys inc atoptech inc zuken ltd and many others offering “point solutions” with manufacturers of electronic devices that have developed acquired or have the capability to develop their own eda products and with numerous electronics design and consulting companies in the area of design ip we compete with synopsys inc ceva inc and numerous other ip companies 

the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations may adversely impact our revenue expenses cash flows and financial condition 

we have significant operations outside the united states our revenue from international operations as a percentage of total revenue was approximately 54  during fiscal 2015 and 56  during both fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2013 we expect that revenue from our international operations will continue to account for a significant portion of our total revenue we also transact business in various foreign currencies the volatility of foreign currencies in certain countries where we conduct business most notably the chinese renminbi japanese yen european union euro and indian rupee have had and may in the future have an effect on our revenue or operating results 

fluctuations in the rate of exchange between the united states or us dollar and the currencies of other countries where we conduct business could seriously affect our business operating results or financial condition for example when a foreign currency declines in value relative to the us dollar it takes more of the foreign currency to purchase the same amount of us dollars than before the change if we price our products and services in the foreign currency we receive fewer us dollars than we did before the change if we price our products and services in us dollars the decrease in value of the local currency results in an increase in the price for our products and services compared to those products of our competitors that are priced in local currency this could result in our prices being uncompetitive in markets where business is transacted in the local currency on the other hand when a foreign currency increases in value relative to the us dollar it takes more us dollars to purchase the same amount of the foreign currency as we use the foreign currency to fund payroll costs and other operating expenses in our international operations this results in an increase in operating expenses approximately 30 of our total costs and expenses are transacted in foreign currencies our attempts to reduce the effect of foreign currency fluctuations may be unsuccessful and significant exchange rate movements may adversely impact our results of operations as expressed in us dollars 

our operating results could be adversely affected as a result of changes in our effective tax rates or by material differences between our forecasted annual effective tax rates and actual tax rates 

any significant change in our future effective tax rates could adversely impact our results of operations for future periods our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by the following 

 our operations are subject to income and transaction taxes in the united states and in multiple foreign jurisdictions with a significant amount of our foreign earnings generated by our subsidiaries organized in ireland and hungary future changes in domestic or international tax laws and regulations could adversely affect our future effective tax rates president obama and the united states congress have called for comprehensive tax reform which among other things might change certain united states tax rules impacting the way united statesbased multinationals are taxed on foreign income additionally in october 2015 the organisation for economic cooperation and development an international association of 34 countries including the united states released the final reports from its base erosion and profit shifting or beps action plans the beps recommendations covered a number of issues including countrybycountry reporting permanent establishment rules transfer pricing rules and tax treaties although the beps recommendations are not themselves changes in tax law this guidance has resulted in unilateral action by several member countries and is also prompting possible amendment of other countries’ tax laws and regulations on a prospective and potentially retroactive basis in october 2015 the european commission concluded that certain member countries had granted unlawful rulings that artificially reduced tax burdens and has ordered the recovery of the unpaid taxes future tax law changes resulting from these developments may result in changes to longstanding tax principles which could adversely affect our effective tax rate or result in higher cash tax liabilities 

forecasts of our annual effective tax rate are complex and subject to uncertainty because our income tax position for each year combines the effects of estimating our annual income or loss the mix of profits and losses earned by us and our subsidiaries in tax jurisdictions with a broad range of income tax rates as well as benefits from available deferred tax assets the impact of various accounting rules and results of tax audits forecasts of our annual effective tax rate do not include the anticipation of future tax law changes if there were a material difference between forecasted and actual tax rates then it could have a material impact on our results of operations 

our stock price has been subject to fluctuations and may continue to be subject to fluctuations 

the market price of our common stock has experienced fluctuations and may fluctuate or decline in the future and as a result you could lose the value of your investment the market price of our common stock may be affected by a number of factors including 

 in addition equity markets in general and the equities of technology companies in particular have experienced and may experience in the future extreme price and volume fluctuations due to among other factors the actions of market participants such price and volume fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock for reasons unrelated to our business or operating results 

our future revenue is dependent in part upon our installed customer base continuing to license or buy products and purchase services 

our installed customer base has traditionally generated additional new license service and maintenance revenues in future periods customers may not necessarily license or buy additional products or contract for additional services or maintenance our customers many of which are large semiconductor and systems companies often have significant bargaining power in negotiations with us customer consolidation can reduce the total level of purchases of our software hardware ip and services and in some cases increase customers’ bargaining power in negotiations with their suppliers including us 

we could suffer serious harm to our business because of the infringement of our intellectual property rights by third parties or because of our infringement of the intellectual property rights of third parties 

there are numerous patents relating to our business and ecosystem new patents are being issued at a rapid rate and are owned by eda companies as well as entities and individuals outside the eda industry including parties whose income is primarily derived from infringementrelated licensing and litigation it is not always practicable to determine in advance whether a product or any of its components infringes the patent rights of others as a result from time to time we may be compelled to respond to or prosecute intellectual property infringement claims to protect our rights or defend a customer’s rights 

intellectual property infringement claims including contractual defense reimbursement obligations related to thirdparty claims against our customers regardless of merit could consume valuable management time result in costly litigation or cause product shipment delays all of which could seriously harm our business operating results or financial condition the risk of infringement and related indemnification claims associated with design ip products that are incorporated into a customer product broadly used by consumers may be higher than the risk associated with our software products in settling these claims we may be required to enter into royalty or licensing agreements with the third parties claiming infringement these royalty or licensing agreements if available may not have terms favorable to us being compelled to enter into a license agreement with unfavorable terms could seriously harm our business operating results or financial condition any potential intellectual property litigation could compel us to do one or more of the following 

 14 

 if we were compelled to take any of these actions our business or operating results may suffer 

if our security measures are breached and an unauthorized party obtains access to customer data or our proprietary business information our information systems may be perceived as being unsecure which could harm our business and reputation 

our products and services involve the storage and transmission of our proprietary information and that of our customers we have offices throughout the world including key research and development facilities outside of the united states our operations are dependent upon the connectivity of our operations throughout the world despite our security measures our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to cyber attacks or breached which could result in unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information and could significantly interfere with our business operations breaches of our security measures could expose us to a risk of loss or misuse of this information litigation and potential liability because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage information systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventive measures in addition if we select a vendor that uses cyber storage of information as part of their service or product offerings despite our attempts to validate the security of such services our proprietary information may be misappropriated by third parties in the event of an actual or perceived breach of our security or the security of one of our vendors the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed and we could suffer damage to our reputation or our business or lose existing customers and our ability to obtain new customers 

risks associated with our international operations could adversely impact our financial condition 

a significant amount of our revenue is derived from our international operations and we have offices throughout the world including key research and development facilities outside of the united states our international operations may be subject to a number of risks including 

 some of our international research and development and other facilities are in parts of the world where there may be a greater risk of business interruption as a result of political instability terrorist acts or military conflicts than businesses located domestically furthermore this potential harm is exacerbated because damage to or disruptions at our international research and development facilities could have a more significant adverse effect on our ability to develop new or improve existing products than other businesses that may only have sales offices or other less critical operations abroad we are not insured for losses or interruptions caused by acts of war furthermore our operations are dependent upon the connectivity of our operations throughout the world activities that interfere with our international connectivity or operations such as cyber hacking the introduction of a virus into our computer systems natural disasters civil unrest or terrorism could significantly interfere with our business operations 

in addition internal controls policies and procedures and employee training and compliance programs that we have implemented to deter prohibited practices may not prevent our employees contractors or agents from violating or circumventing our policies and the laws and regulations applicable to our worldwide operations 

we depend upon our management team and key employees and our failure to attract train motivate and retain management and key employees may make us less competitive and therefore harm our results of operations 

our business depends upon the continued services efforts and abilities of our senior management and other key employees competition for highly skilled executive officers and employees can be intense particularly in geographic areas recognized as high technology centers such as the silicon valley area where our principal offices are located and in other locations where we maintain facilities in addition competition for qualified personnel including software engineers in the eda commercial electronics engineering services and ip industries has intensified we may also experience increased compensation costs that are not offset by either improved productivity or higher sales we may not be successful in recruiting new personnel and in retaining and motivating existing personnel from time to time there may be changes in our management team resulting from the hiring and departure of executive officers and as a result we may experience disruption to our business that may harm our operating results and our relationships with our employees customers and suppliers may be adversely affected 

to attract retain and motivate individuals with the requisite expertise we may be required to grant large numbers of stock options or other stockbased incentive awards which may be dilutive to existing stockholders and increase compensation expense and pay significant base salaries and cash bonuses which could harm our operating results the high cost of training new employees not fully utilizing these employees or losing trained employees to competing employers could also reduce our operating margins and harm our business or operating results 

in addition applicable rules and regulations require stockholder approval for new equity compensation plans and significant amendments to existing equity compensation plans including increases in shares available for issuance under such plans and prohibit publiclytraded companies from giving a proxy to vote on equity compensation plans unless the beneficial owner of the shares has given voting instructions these rules and regulations could make it more difficult for us to grant equity compensation to employees in the future to the extent that these regulations make it more difficult or expensive to grant equity compensation to employees we may incur increased compensation costs or find it difficult to attract retain and motivate employees which could materially and adversely affect our business 

we rely on our proprietary technology as well as software and other intellectual property rights licensed to us by third parties and we cannot assure you that the precautions taken to protect our rights will be adequate or that we will continue to be able to adequately secure such intellectual property rights from third parties 

our success depends in part upon our proprietary technology we generally rely on patents copyrights trademarks trade secrets licenses and restrictive agreements to establish and protect our proprietary rights in technology and products despite the precautions we may take to protect our intellectual property third parties have tried in the past and may try in the future to challenge invalidate or circumvent these safeguards our patents and other intellectual property rights may not provide us with sufficient competitive advantages patents may not be issued on any of our pending applications and our issued patents may not be sufficiently broad to protect our technology furthermore the laws of foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights in those countries to the same extent as applicable law protects these rights in the united states the protection of our intellectual property may require the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources moreover the steps we take to protect our intellectual property may not adequately protect our rights or deter or prevent third parties from infringing or misappropriating our proprietary rights 

many of our products include software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties we may have to seek new or renew existing licenses for such software and other intellectual property in the future our engineering services business holds licenses to certain software and other intellectual property owned by third parties including that of our competitors our failure to obtain software other intellectual property licenses or other intellectual property rights that are necessary or helpful for our business on favorable terms or our need to engage in litigation over these licenses or rights could seriously harm our business operating results or financial condition 

litigation could adversely affect our financial condition or operations 

we currently are and in the future may be involved in various disputes and litigation that arise in the ordinary course of business these include disputes and lawsuits related to intellectual property including customer indemnification mergers and acquisitions licensing contracts distribution arrangements and employee relations matters for information regarding the litigation matters in which we are currently engaged please refer to the discussion under item 3 “legal proceedings” and note 7 in the notes to consolidated financial statements we cannot provide any assurances that the final outcome of these lawsuits or any other proceedings that may arise in the future will not have a material adverse effect on our business operating results financial condition or cash flows litigation can be time consuming and expensive and could divert management’s time and attention from our business which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and operating results 

errors or defects in our products and services could expose us to liability and harm our business 

our customers use our products and services in designing and developing products that involve a high degree of technological complexity each of which has its own specifications because of the complexity of the systems and products with which we work some of our products and designs can be adequately tested only when put to full use in the marketplace as a result our customers or their end users may discover errors or defects in our software or the systems we design or the products or systems incorporating our design and intellectual property may not operate as expected errors or defects could result in 

 liability for damages 

our operating results and revenue could be adversely affected by customer payment delays customer bankruptcies and defaults or modifications of licenses 

occasionally our customers file for bankruptcy or request to modify license terms if our customers experience adversity in their business they may delay or default on their payment obligations to us file for bankruptcy or modify or cancel plans to license our products for instance if our customers are not successful in generating sufficient cash or are precluded from securing financing they may not be able to pay or may delay payment of accounts receivable that are owed to us although these obligations are generally not cancelable our customers’ inability to fulfill payment obligations in turn may adversely affect our revenue and cash flow additionally our customers have in the past sought and may in the future seek to renegotiate preexisting contractual commitments payment defaults by our customers or significant reductions in existing contractual commitments could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results 

the long sales cycle of our products and services may cause our operating results to fluctuate unexpectedly 

generally we have a long sales cycle that can extend up to six months or longer the complexity and expense associated with our products and services generally require a lengthy customer education evaluation and approval process consequently we may incur substantial expenses and devote significant management effort and expense to develop potential relationships that do not result in agreements or revenue and may prevent us from pursuing other opportunities 

in addition sales of our products and services have been and may in the future be delayed if customers delay approval or commencement of projects because of 

 long sales cycles for hardware products subject us to a number of significant risks over which we have limited control including insufficient excess or obsolete inventory variations in inventory valuation and fluctuations in quarterly operating results 

we have substantial cash requirements in the united states but a significant portion of our cash is held and generated outside of the united states and if our cash available in the united states and the cash available under our revolving credit facility is insufficient to meet our operating expenses and debt repayment obligations in the united states then we may be required to raise cash in ways that could negatively affect our financial condition results of operations and the market price of our common stock 

we have significant operations outside the united states as of january 2 2016  approximately 61  of our cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments balance was held by subsidiaries outside the united states with the remainder of the balance held by us or our subsidiaries in the united states we believe that the combination of our us cash cash equivalents future us operating cash flows cash available under our revolving credit facility and other cash that may be accessible to us on attractive terms are sufficient to meet our ongoing us operating expenses and debt repayment obligations however if these sources of cash were insufficient to meet our future funding obligations in the united states we could be required to seek funding sources on less attractive terms which could negatively impact our results of operations financial position and the market price of our common stock 

our reported financial results may be adversely affected by changes in united states generally accepted accounting principles and we may incur significant costs to adjust our accounting systems and processes to comply with significant changes 

united states generally accepted accounting principles or us gaap are subject to interpretation by the financial accounting standards board or fasb the american institute of certified public accountants the sec and various bodies formed to promulgate and interpret appropriate accounting principles the fasb is currently working together with the international accounting standards board or iasb on several projects to further align accounting principles and facilitate more comparable financial reporting between companies that are required to follow us gaap under sec regulations and those that are required to follow ifrs outside of the united states these efforts by the fasb and iasb may result in different accounting principles under us gaap that could have a significant effect on our reported financial results for us in areas including but not limited to principles for recognizing revenue and accounting for leases for information regarding new accounting standards please refer to note 2 in the notes to consolidated financial statements under the heading “new accounting standards” 

in addition we may need to significantly change our customer contracts accounting systems and processes if we are required to adopt future or proposed changes in accounting principles noted above the cost and effect of these changes may negatively impact our results of operations during the periods of transition 

the irs and other tax authorities regularly examine our tax returns and the outcome of current and future tax examinations may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows 

the irs and other tax authorities regularly examine our income tax returns and other nonincome tax returns such as payroll sales use valueadded net worth or franchise property goods and services consumption import stamp and excise taxes in both the united states and foreign jurisdictions governments are increasingly focused on ways to increase tax revenues particularly from multinational corporations which may lead to an increase in audit activity and harsher stances taken by tax authorities the calculation of our provision for income taxes and our accruals for other taxes requires us to use significant judgment and involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes we regularly assess the potential settlement outcomes resulting from income tax examinations however the final outcome of tax examinations including the total amount payable or the timing of any such payments upon resolution of these issues cannot be estimated with certainty in addition we cannot be certain that such amount will not be materially different from the amount that is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals for other taxes should the irs or other tax authorities assess additional taxes penalties or interest as a result of a current or a future examination we may be required to record charges to operations in future periods that could have a material impact on our results of operations financial position or cash flows in the applicable period or periods 

the investment of our cash in money market funds and marketable debt securities is subject to risks that may cause losses and affect the liquidity of these investments 

our investments include various money market funds and marketable debt securities such as corporate debt securities us treasury securities us government agency securities bank certificates of deposit and commercial paper weakened financial markets have at times adversely impacted the general credit liquidity market prices and interest rates for these and other types of debt securities additionally changes in monetary policy by the federal open market committee and concerns about the rising us government debt level may cause a decrease in the purchasing power of the us dollar and adversely affect our investment portfolio furthermore if there is a default or downgrade of us government or agency debt securities our investment portfolio may be adversely impacted requiring impairment charges that could adversely affect our liquidity financial position results of operations or cash flows the financial market and monetary risks associated with our investment portfolio may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition liquidity results of operations or cash flows 

our restructuring plans may not result in the benefits we have anticipated possibly having a negative effect on our future operating results 

in recent fiscal years we have initiated restructuring plans in an effort to reallocate or decrease costs by reducing our workforce and by consolidating facilities we incur substantial costs to implement restructuring plans and our restructuring activities may subject us to litigation risks and expenses in addition our restructuring plans may have other consequences such as attrition beyond our planned reduction in workforce a negative effect on employee morale and productivity or our ability to attract highly skilled employees our competitors may also use our restructuring plans to seek to gain a competitive advantage over us as a result our restructuring plans may affect our revenue and other operating results in the future 

failure to obtain export licenses could harm our business by rendering us unable to ship products and transfer our technology outside of the united states 

we must comply with regulations of the united states and of certain other countries in shipping our products and transferring our technology outside the united states and to foreign nationals any significant future difficulty in complying with these regulations could harm our business operating results or financial condition 

if we become subject to unfair hiring claims we could be prevented from hiring needed employees incur liability for damages and incur substantial costs in defending ourselves 

when companies in our industry lose employees to competitors they frequently claim that these competitors have engaged in unfair hiring practices or that the employment of these persons would involve the disclosure or use of trade secrets these claims could prevent us from hiring employees or cause us to incur liability for damages we could also incur substantial costs in defending ourselves or our employees against these claims regardless of their merits defending ourselves from these claims could also divert the attention of our management away from our operations 

antitakeover defenses in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and certain provisions under delaware law could prevent an acquisition of our company or limit the price that investors might be willing to pay for our common stock 

our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and certain provisions of the delaware general corporation law that apply to us could make it difficult for another company to acquire control of our company for example 

 all or any one of these factors could limit the price that certain investors would be willing to pay for shares of our common stock and could allow our board of directors to resist delay or prevent an acquisition of our company even if a proposed transaction were favored by a majority of our independent stockholders   

conflict minerals regulations may cause us to continue to incur additional expenses and may adversely impact our ability to conduct our business 

in august 2012 the sec adopted new rules establishing disclosure and reporting requirements regarding the use of certain minerals referred to as “conflict minerals” in products these rules require us to determine disclose and report whether or not such minerals in our products originate from the democratic republic of the congo or adjoining countries we have incurred and expect to continue to incur costs to comply with these rules including costs associated with conducting due diligence on our supply chain and fulfilling our reporting requirements and we may incur costs related to changes to our products processes or sources of supply in addition these rules could affect the availability of certain minerals used in the manufacture of our emulation and prototyping hardware products and ip boards or the covered products and thus impact our ability to source at competitive prices certain materials that are used in the covered products finally our customers may prefer to purchase products from vendors who claim that all minerals in their products are conflictfree and our revenues may be harmed or we may face reputational challenges if we are unable to verify that our covered products are conflictfree 

our business is subject to the risk of earthquakes and other natural disasters 

our corporate headquarters including certain of our research and development operations and certain of our distribution facilities is located in the silicon valley area of northern california a region known to experience seismic activity if significant seismic activity were to occur our operations may be interrupted which could adversely impact our business and results of operations 

our other offices in the united states and in other countries around the world may be adversely impacted by natural disasters if a natural disaster occurs at or near any of our offices our operations may be interrupted which could adversely impact our business and results of operations if a natural disaster impacts a significant number of our customers our business and results of operations could be adversely impacted 

risks related to our securities and indebtedness 

our debt obligations expose us to risks that could adversely affect our business operating results or financial condition and could prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under such indebtedness 

we have a substantial level of debt as of january 2 2016  we had total outstanding indebtedness with a principal balance of 3500 million  we also had the ability to borrow 2500 million  under our revolving credit facility with the right to request increased capacity up to an additional 1500 million  upon the receipt of lender commitments for total maximum borrowings of 4000 million  available under our revolving credit facility subject to the limits contained in the credit agreement governing our revolving credit facility the indenture that governs the 4375 senior notes due 2024 or the 2024 notes and our other debt instruments we may be able to incur substantial additional debt from time to time to finance working capital capital expenditures investments or acquisitions share repurchases or for other purposes if we do so the risks related to our high level of debt could intensify specifically our high level of debt could have important consequences including the following 

 acquisitions or other general corporate requirements 

 purposes thereby reducing the amount of cash flows available for working capital capital expenditures 

acquisitions and other general corporate purposes 

 our revolving credit facility are at variable rates of interest 

 at the option of the holders of our outstanding notes we may under certain circumstances be required to repurchase such notes 

under the terms of our 2024 notes we may be required to repurchase for cash such notes prior to their maturity in connection with the occurrence of certain significant corporate events specifically we are required to offer to repurchase such notes upon a “change of control triggering event” as defined in the indenture related to such notes such as a change of control accompanied by certain downgrades in the credit ratings of such notes the repayment obligations under such notes may have the effect of discouraging delaying or preventing a takeover of our company if we were required to pay the 2024 notes prior to their scheduled maturity it could have a significant negative impact on our cash and liquidity and could impact our ability to invest financial resources in other strategic initiatives 

the terms of the credit agreement governing our revolving credit facility and the indenture governing our 2024 notes restrict our current and future operations particularly our ability to respond to changes or to take certain actions 

the credit agreement governing our revolving credit facility contains a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and may limit our ability to engage in acts that may be in our longterm best interest including restrictions on our ability to 

 20 

in addition the restrictive covenants in the credit agreement governing our revolving credit facility require us to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy other financial condition tests our ability to meet those financial ratios and tests can be affected by events beyond our control and we may be unable to meet them 

a breach of the covenants or restrictions under the credit agreement governing our revolving credit facility could result in an event of default under the applicable indebtedness such a default may allow the creditors to accelerate the related debt and may result in the acceleration of any other debt to which a crossacceleration or crossdefault provision applies in addition an event of default under the credit agreement governing our revolving credit facility would permit the lenders under our revolving credit facility to terminate all commitments to extend further credit under that facility in the event our lenders or note holders accelerate the repayment of our borrowings we and our subsidiaries may not have sufficient assets to repay that indebtedness as a result of these restrictions we may be 

 the indenture governing our 2024 notes also contains certain restrictive covenants that impose operating and financial restrictions on us and may limit our ability to engage in acts that may be in our longterm best interest including restrictions on our ability to incur liens and to enter into sale and leaseback transactions 

these restrictions may affect our ability to grow in accordance with our strategy in addition our financial results our substantial indebtedness and our credit ratings could adversely affect the availability and terms of our financing 

we may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness which may not be successful 

our ability to make scheduled payments on or refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial condition and operating performance which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial business legislative regulatory and other factors beyond our control we may be unable to maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal premium if any and interest on our indebtedness 

if our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations we could face substantial liquidity problems and could be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures or to dispose of material assets or operations seek additional debt or equity capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness we may not be able to effect any such alternative measures if necessary on commercially reasonable terms or at all and even if successful those alternative actions may not allow us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations the credit agreement governing our revolving credit facility restricts our ability to dispose of assets and use the proceeds from those dispositions and may also restrict our ability to raise debt or equity capital to be used to repay other indebtedness when it becomes due we may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain proceeds in an amount sufficient to meet any debt service obligations then due 

in addition we conduct a substantial portion of our operations through our subsidiaries none of which are currently guarantors of our indebtedness accordingly repayment of our indebtedness is dependent on the generation of cash flow by our subsidiaries and their ability to make such cash available to us by dividend debt repayment or otherwise unless they become guarantors of our indebtedness our subsidiaries do not have any obligation to pay amounts due on our indebtedness or to make funds available for that purpose our subsidiaries may not be able to or may not be permitted to make distributions to enable us to make payments in respect of our indebtedness each subsidiary is a distinct legal entity and under certain circumstances legal and contractual restrictions may limit our ability to obtain cash from our subsidiaries while the credit agreement governing our revolving credit facility limits the ability of our subsidiaries to incur consensual restrictions on their ability to pay dividends or make other intercompany payments to us these limitations are subject to qualifications and exceptions in the event that we do not receive distributions from our subsidiaries we may be unable to make required principal and interest payments on our indebtedness 

our inability to generate sufficient cash flows to satisfy our debt obligations or to refinance our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all would materially and adversely affect our financial position and results of operations and our ability to satisfy our debt obligations 

if we cannot make scheduled payments on our debt we will be in default and holders of our debt could declare all outstanding principal and interest to be due and payable the lenders under our revolving credit facility could terminate their commitments to loan money and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation in addition a material default on our indebtedness could suspend our eligibility to register securities using certain registration statement forms under sec guidelines that permit incorporation by reference of substantial information regarding us potentially hindering our ability to raise capital through the issuance of our securities and increasing our costs of registration 

despite our current level of indebtedness we and our subsidiaries may incur substantially more debt this could further exacerbate the risks to our financial condition described above 

we and our subsidiaries may incur significant additional indebtedness in the future although the credit agreement governing our revolving credit facility contains restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions and the additional indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial if we incur any additional indebtedness that ranks equally with the 2024 notes then subject to any collateral arrangements we may enter into the holders of that debt will be entitled to share ratably in any proceeds distributed in connection with any insolvency liquidation reorganization dissolution or other winding up of our company 

our variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly 

borrowings under our revolving credit facility are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk if we were to borrow under our revolving credit facility and if interest rates were to increase our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness would increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same and our net income and cash flows including cash available for servicing our indebtedness would correspondingly decrease assuming all loans were fully drawn and that we were to fully exercise our right to increase borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility each quarter point change in interest rates would result in an approximately 10 million change in annual interest expense on our indebtedness under our revolving credit facility in the future we may enter into interest rate swaps that involve the exchange of floating for fixed rate interest payments in order to reduce interest rate volatility however we may not maintain interest rate swaps with respect to all of our variable rate indebtedness and any swaps we enter into may not fully mitigate our interest rate risk 

various factors could increase our future borrowing costs or reduce our access to capital including a lowering or withdrawal of the ratings assigned to our 2024 notes by rating agencies 

we may in the future seek additional financing for a variety of reasons and our future borrowing costs and access to capital could be affected by factors including the condition of the debt and equity markets the condition of the economy generally prevailing interest rates our level of indebtedness and our business and financial condition in addition the 2024 notes currently have an investment grade rating and any rating assigned could be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if in that rating agency’s judgment future circumstances relating to the basis of the rating such as adverse changes so warrant consequently real or anticipated changes in our credit ratings will generally affect the market value of the 2024 notes any future lowering of the ratings of the 2024 notes likely would make it more difficult or more expensive for us to obtain additional debt financing

we believe that these facilities are adequate for our current needs and that suitable additional or substitute space will be available as needed to accommodate any expansion of our operations 




  item 3 legal proceedings 

from time to time we are involved in various disputes and litigation that arise in the ordinary course of business these include disputes and lawsuits related to intellectual property indemnification obligations mergers and acquisitions licensing contracts distribution arrangements and employee relations matters at least quarterly we review the status of each significant matter and assess its potential financial exposure if the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount or the range of loss can be estimated we accrue a liability for the estimated loss legal proceedings are subject to uncertainties and the outcomes are difficult to predict because of such uncertainties accruals are based on our judgments using the best information available at the time as additional information becomes available we reassess the potential liability related to pending claims and litigation matters and may revise estimates

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

  

the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k and with part i item 1a “risk factors” please refer to the cautionary language at the beginning of part i of this annual report on form 10k regarding forwardlooking statements 

business overview 

we continue to focus on executing our system design enablement or sde strategy to deliver the technologies necessary for integrated system and soc design with an end product in mind our growing core eda business is at the heart of our sde strategy and is complemented by our business in ip system interconnect and analysis system level design and hardwaresoftware development 

our business serves customers that are driven by enduser demand for electronics systems ics and devices that are smaller use less power and provide more functionality we offer innovative solutions to help our customers meet these demands 

our future performance depends on our ability to innovate commercialize newly developed solutions and enhance and maintain our current products we must keep pace with our customers’ technical developments satisfy industry standards and meet our customers’ increasingly demanding performance productivity quality and predictability requirements we expect to continue to invest in research and development and customer and partner relationships 

we have identified certain items that management uses as performance indicators to manage our business including revenue certain elements of operating expenses and cash flow from operations and we describe these items further below under the headings “results of operations” and “liquidity and capital resources” 

results of operations 

financial results for fiscal 2015  as compared to fiscal 2014  and 2013  reflect the following 

 our fiscal year ends on the saturday closest to december 31 fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2013 were 52week years whereas fiscal 2014 was a 53week year revenue and expenses included in the results of operations for fiscal 2014 were impacted by the additional week 

revenue 

we primarily generate revenue from licensing our software and ip selling or leasing our emulation and prototyping hardware technology providing maintenance for our software hardware and ip providing engineering services and earning royalties generated from the use of our ip the timing of our revenue is significantly affected by the mix of software hardware and ip products generating revenue in any given period and whether the revenue is recognized in a recurring manner over multiple periods or up front upon completion of delivery 

 we seek to achieve a consistent revenue mix such that approximately 90 of our revenue is recurring in nature and the remainder of the resulting revenue is recognized up front upon completion of delivery recurring revenue includes revenue from our software and ip license arrangements where revenue is recognized over multiple periods services royalties from certain ip arrangements maintenance on perpetual software licenses and hardware and our operating leases of hardware upfront revenue is primarily generated by our sales of emulation and prototyping hardware and perpetual software and ip licenses our ability to achieve this mix in any single fiscal period may be impacted primarily by delivery of hardware and ip products to our customers for an additional description of our current product strategy see the discussion under the heading “products and product strategy” under part i item 1 “business” 

approximately 90 of the aggregate value of our revenue during fiscal 2015  2014  and 2013  was of a type for which the revenue is recurring in nature 

 we believe our reported revenue and the amount of revenue recognized in future periods will depend on among other things the 

 revenue by year 

the following table shows our revenue for fiscal 2015  2014  and 2013  and the change in revenue between years 



product and maintenance revenue increased during fiscal 2015  as compared to fiscal 2014  primarily due to increased demand for our software emulation and prototyping hardware services and ip offerings product and maintenance revenue increased during fiscal 2014  as compared to fiscal 2013  primarily because of increased business levels incremental revenue recognized from our acquisitions and an additional week of operations in fiscal 2014 the additional week of operations contributed approximately 150 million of revenue to fiscal 2014 we expect product and maintenance revenue to increase during fiscal 2016 due to increased demand for our new and existing product offerings 

services revenue increased during fiscal 2015  as compared to fiscal 2014  due to increased demand for our service and ip offerings services revenue remained relatively constant during fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 services revenue may fluctuate from period to period based on demand for and our resources to fulfill our services and customized ip offerings 

no one customer accounted for 10  or more of total revenue during fiscal 2015  2014  or 2013  

revenue by product group 

the following table shows the percentage of product and related maintenance revenue contributed by each of our five product groups and services during fiscal 2015  2014  and 2013  



as described in note 2 in the notes to consolidated financial statements certain of our licensing arrangements allow customers the ability to remix among software products additionally we have arrangements with customers that include a combination of our products with the actual product selection and number of licensed users to be determined at a later date for these arrangements we estimate the allocation of the revenue to product groups based upon the expected usage of our products the actual usage of our products by these customers may differ and if that proves to be the case the revenue allocation in the table above would differ 

revenue by geography 



for the primary factors contributing to the increase in revenue for the united states other americas and asia during fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 see the general description under “revenue by year” above revenue for europe middle east and africa decreased during fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 primarily due to a reduction of services revenue as we shifted our resources from design services to our ip offerings revenue for japan decreased during fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 primarily due to the continued depreciation of the japanese yen as well as difficult business conditions facing our japanese customers 

for the primary factors contributing to the increase in revenue for the united states other americas and europe middle east and africa during fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 see the general description under “revenue by year” above revenue for asia increased during fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 primarily due to increases in revenue from our software business and emulation and prototyping hardware installations revenue for japan decreased during fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 primarily due to the depreciation of the japanese yen as well as difficult business conditions facing our japanese customers 

most of our revenue is transacted in the united states dollar however certain revenue transactions are denominated in foreign currencies primarily the japanese yen we recognize reduced revenue from those contracts in periods when the japanese yen weakens in value against the united states dollar and additional revenue from those contracts in periods when the japanese yen strengthens against the united states dollar for an additional description of how changes in foreign exchange rates affect our consolidated financial statements see the discussion in item 7a “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk – foreign currency risk”

cost of product and maintenance 

cost of product and maintenance includes costs associated with the sale and lease of our emulation and prototyping hardware and licensing of our software and ip products certain employee salary and benefits and other employeerelated costs cost of our customer support services amortization of technologyrelated and maintenancerelated acquired intangibles as well as the costs of technical documentation and royalties payable to thirdparty vendors costs associated with our emulation and prototyping hardware products include materials assembly applicable reserves and overhead these hardware manufacturing costs make our cost of emulation and prototyping hardware product higher as a percentage of revenue than our cost of software and ip products 

a summary of cost of product and maintenance for fiscal 2015  2014  and 2013  is as follows 

  

cost of product and maintenance depends primarily upon our hardware product sales in any given period cost of product and maintenance is also affected by employee salary and benefits and other employeerelated costs as well as the timing and extent to which we acquire intangible assets acquire or license thirdparties’ intellectual property or technology and sell our products that include such acquired or licensed intellectual property or technology 

the changes in product and maintenancerelated costs were due to the following 



emulation and prototyping hardware costs decreased during fiscal 2015  as compared to fiscal 2014  and increased during fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 primarily because charges for inventory reserves were higher during fiscal 2014 gross margins on our hardware products may fluctuate based on customer pricing strategies product competition and product life cycle 

amortization of acquired intangibles included in cost of product and maintenance increased during fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 and during fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 primarily due to the increase in amortization of intangible assets associated with our fiscal 2014 and 2013 acquisitions for an additional description of our expected amortization of intangible assets see note 11 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

cost of services 

cost of services primarily includes employee salary benefits and other employeerelated costs to perform work on revenuegenerating projects costs to maintain the infrastructure necessary to manage a services organization and provisions for contract losses if any cost of services will fluctuate from period to period based on our utilization of design services engineers on revenuegenerating projects or on internal development projects cost of services increased during fiscal 2015  as compared to fiscal 2014  primarily due to an overall increase in services revenue and in the resources required to meet the demand for our services and ip offerings 

  operating expenses 

our operating expenses include marketing and sales research and development and general and administrative expenses factors that cause our operating expenses to fluctuate include changes in the number of employees due to hiring and acquisitions foreign exchange rates stockbased compensation and the impact of our variable compensation programs that are driven by overall operating results 

many of our operating expenses are transacted in various foreign currencies we recognize lower expenses in periods when the united states dollar strengthens in value against other currencies and we recognize higher expenses when the united states dollar weakens against other currencies during fiscal 2015  as compared to fiscal 2014  we experienced a favorable impact on expenses as a result of the strengthening value of the united states dollar against other currencies including the european union euro and the japanese yen for an additional description of how changes in foreign exchange rates affect our consolidated financial statements see the discussion in item 7a “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk – foreign currency risk” 

our employee salary and other compensationrelated costs included in marketing and sales and research and development increased during fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 primarily due to incremental investments in technical customer support and research and development partially offset by the strengthening value of the united states dollar against other currencies our employee salary and other compensationrelated costs included in marketing and sales and research and development increased during fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 primarily due to incremental costs related to employees added from our fiscal 2014 and 2013 acquisitions we expect employee salary and other compensationrelated costs included in marketing and sales and research and development to increase during fiscal 2016 due to continued investments in technical customer support and research and development 

stockbased compensation included in operating expenses increased 81 million  during fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 and 159 million  during fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 primarily because of higher grantdate fair values of stock awards vesting during fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014 respectively we expect stockbased compensation included in operating expenses to increase during fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015 due to amortization during fiscal 2016 of unrecognized expense related to unvested awards with generally higher grantdate fair values compared to awards that vested in previous years and amortization from new awards expected to be granted during fiscal 2016 

our operating expenses for fiscal 2015  2014  and 2013  were as follows 



our operating expenses as a percentage of total revenue for fiscal 2015  2014  and 2013  were as follows 



  

marketing and sales 

the changes in marketing and sales expense were due to the following 



research and development 

  the changes in research and development expense were due to the following 



general and administrative 

the changes in general and administrative expense were due to the following 



amortization of acquired intangibles 



the changes in amortization of acquired intangibles were due to the following 



restructuring and other charges 

we have initiated various restructuring plans in recent years to better align our resources with our business strategy because the restructuring charges and related benefits are derived from management’s estimates made during the formulation of the restructuring plans based on thencurrently available information our restructuring plans may not achieve the benefits anticipated on the timetable or at the level contemplated demand for our products and services and ultimately our future financial performance is difficult to predict with any degree of certainty accordingly additional actions including further restructuring of our operations may be required in the future 

the following table presents restructuring and other charges credits net for our restructuring plans 



for an additional description of our restructuring plans see note 12 in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

interest expense 



during fiscal 2015 we settled the outstanding principal balance of our 2015 notes 

income taxes 

the following table presents the provision benefit for income taxes and the effective tax rate for fiscal 2015  2014  and 2013  



our provision for income taxes for the fiscal year ended january 2 2016  was primarily attributable to federal state and foreign income taxes on our fiscal 2015 income which was partially offset by 138 million  of tax benefit related to the effective settlement of a tax examination of a foreign subsidiary our provision for income taxes included a tax benefit of 101 million  resulting from the enactment of the united states research tax credit in december 2015 our foreign earnings are generally subject to lower statutory tax rates than our united states earnings 

our provision for income taxes for the fiscal year ended january 3 2015  primarily resulted from federal state and foreign income taxes on our fiscal 2014 income our foreign earnings are generally subject to lower statutory tax rates than our united states earnings our provision for income taxes included a tax benefit of 81 million  resulting from the enactment of the united states research tax credit in december 2014 

our benefit for income taxes for the fiscal year ended december 28 2013  primarily consisted of the following 

 which were partially offset by 

 35 

our future effective tax rates may be materially impacted by tax amounts associated with our foreign earnings at rates different from the united states federal statutory rate research credits the tax impact of stockbased compensation accounting for uncertain tax positions business combinations closure of statutes of limitations or settlement of tax audits changes in valuation allowance and changes in tax law a significant amount of our foreign earnings is generated by our subsidiaries organized in ireland and hungary our future effective tax rates may be adversely affected if our earnings were to be lower in countries where we have lower statutory tax rates or if we were to repatriate certain foreign earnings on which united states taxes have not been previously accrued we currently expect that our fiscal 2016 effective tax rate will be higher than our fiscal 2015 effective tax rate for additional discussion about how our effective tax rate could be affected by various risks see part i item 1a “risk factors” 

for further discussion regarding our income taxes see note 6 in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

 liquidity and capital resources 



cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments 

as of january 2 2016  our principal sources of liquidity consisted of 7112 million  of cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments as compared to 10226 million  as of january 3 2015  

our primary sources of cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments during fiscal 2015  were proceeds from convertible notes hedges cash generated from operations proceeds from the exercise of stock options and proceeds from stock purchases under our employee stock purchase plan 

our primary uses of cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments during fiscal 2015  were payments related to salaries and benefits other employeerelated costs and operating expenses payments related to our 2015 notes repurchases of our common stock purchases of property plant and equipment tax payments and interest payments the 2015 notes matured on june 1 2015 at which time we paid net cash of 3538 million  of outstanding principal balance and accrued interest to holders of the 2015 notes upon conversion or maturity 

 approximately 61  of our cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments were held by our foreign subsidiaries as of january 2 2016  our intent is to indefinitely reinvest our earnings from certain foreign operations we do not anticipate we will need to repatriate dividends from foreign operations that are indefinitely reinvested in order to fund our domestic operations in the event that dividends from foreign operations that are currently indefinitely reinvested are needed to fund united states liquidity we could be required to accrue and pay additional taxes in order to repatriate these funds for further discussion regarding our income taxes see note 6 in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

we maintain an investment portfolio of approximately 100 million in marketable debt securities including corporate debt securities united states treasury securities united states government agency securities bank certificates of deposit and commercial paper our investments in marketable debt securities are classified as availableforsale and are included in shortterm investments as of january 2 2016  our investments are made in accordance with our cash investment policy which governs the amounts and types of investments we hold in our portfolio our investment portfolio could be affected by various risks and uncertainties including credit risk interest rate risk and general market risk as outlined in part i item 1a “risk factors” 

we expect that current cash cash equivalents and shortterm investment balances cash flows that are generated from operations proceeds from additional domestic borrowings and cash borrowings available under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to meet our domestic and international working capital needs and other capital and liquidity requirements including acquisitions if any and share repurchases for at least the next 12 months 

net working capital 

net working capital is comprised of current assets less current liabilities as shown on our consolidated balance sheets the decrease in our net working capital as of january 2 2016  as compared to january 3 2015  is primarily due the reclassification of our current deferred tax assets to long term on the balance sheet as the result of the adoption of a new accounting standard intended to simplify the presentation of deferred income taxes partially offset by an increase in receivables net and prepaid expenses and other current assets 

for additional information relating to the impact of new accounting standards on our consolidated financial statements see note 2 in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

cash flows from operating activities 

cash flows from operating activities during fiscal 2015  2014  and 2013  were as follows 



cash flows provided by operating activities include net income adjusted for certain noncash items as well as changes in the balances of certain assets and liabilities our cash flows from operating activities are significantly influenced by business levels and the payment terms set forth in our license agreements 

the increase in cash flows from operating activities during fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 was primarily due to improved profitability and the timing of cash receipts from customers and disbursements made to vendors the decrease in cash flows from operating activities during fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 was primarily due to the timing of cash receipts from customers working capital requirements payments under our recent restructuring plans payments for our voluntary early retirement program and an increase in cash paid for taxes net of tax refunds 

we expect that cash flows from operating activities will fluctuate in future periods due to a number of factors including our operating results tax payments and the timing of our billings collections and disbursements 

cash flows from investing activities 

cash flows from investing activities during fiscal 2015  2014  and 2013  were as follows 



the decrease in cash flows used for investing activities during fiscal 2015  as compared to fiscal 2014  and during fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 was primarily due to the decrease in cash paid for business combinations because we did not complete any acquisitions during fiscal 2015 and paid less for acquired businesses in fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 we expect to continue our investing activities including purchasing property plant and equipment purchasing intangible assets business combinations and purchasing software licenses 

cash flows from financing activities 

cash flows provided by used for financing activities during fiscal 2015  2014  and 2013  were as follows 



the increase in cash used for financing activities during fiscal 2015  as compared to fiscal 2014  was primarily due to payments made to settle the principal value of the 2015 notes and an increase in payments made to repurchase shares of our common stock the increase in cash flows provided by financing activities during fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 was primarily due to proceeds from the issuance of our 2024 notes partially offset by payments made for the repurchase of our common stock 

other factors affecting liquidity and capital resources 

stock repurchase program 

as of january 2 2016  we had approximately 960 million  remaining under our authorized stock repurchase program we expect to execute this program through the end of fiscal 2016 the actual timing and amount of repurchases will be subject to business and market conditions corporate and regulatory requirements acquisition opportunities and other factors the stock repurchase program may be suspended modified or discontinued at any time and will be funded by us cash on hand future us cash flow and additional debt for an additional description of our share repurchase programs and repurchase authorizations see part ii item 5 “market for registrant’s common equity related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities” 

2019 term loan 

on january 28 2016 cadence entered into a 3000 million threeyear senior unsecured nonamortizing term loan facility or the 2019 term loan with a group of lenders led by jpmorgan chase bank na as administrative agent the 2019 term loan is unsecured and the proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes including the repurchase of our common stock for additional information relating the 2019 term loan see note 20 in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

2024 notes 

in october 2014 we issued 3500 million  aggregate principal amount of 4375  senior notes due october 15 2024 we received net proceeds of 3424 million  from the issuance of the 2024 notes net of a discount of 14 million  and issuance costs of 62 million  interest is payable in cash semiannually the 2024 notes are unsecured and rank equal in right of payment to all of our existing and future senior indebtedness the proceeds from the 2024 notes are available for general corporate purposes which may include the retirement of debt working capital capital expenditures acquisitions and strategic transactions 

revolving credit facility 

we maintain a senior unsecured revolving credit facility with a group of lenders led by bank of america na as administrative agent the credit facility provides for borrowings up to 2500 million  with the right to request increased capacity up to an additional 1500 million  upon the receipt of lender commitments for total maximum borrowings of 4000 million  the credit facility as amended expires on september 19 2019  and currently has no subsidiary guarantors any outstanding loans drawn under the credit facility are due at maturity on september 19 2019  outstanding borrowings may be paid at any time prior to maturity 

contractual obligations 

a summary of our contractual obligations as of january 2 2016  is as follows 



 

 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

as of january 2 2016  we did not have any significant offbalance sheet arrangements as defined in item 303a4ii of sec regulation sk 

critical accounting estimates 

in preparing our consolidated financial statements we make assumptions judgments and estimates that can have a significant impact on our revenue operating income and net income as well as on the value of certain assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets we base our assumptions judgments and estimates on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions at least quarterly we evaluate our assumptions judgments and estimates and make changes as deemed necessary we believe that the assumptions judgments and estimates involved in the accounting for income taxes revenue recognition business combinations intangible asset and goodwill impairments and fair value of financial instruments have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements therefore we consider these to be our critical accounting estimates for information on our significant accounting policies see note 2 in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

accounting for income taxes 

we are subject to income taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our provision for these taxes there are many transactions that occur during the ordinary course of business for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain our provision for income taxes could be adversely affected by our earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries where we have higher statutory rates losses incurred in jurisdictions for which we are not able to realize the related tax benefit changes in foreign currency exchange rates entry into new businesses and geographies and changes to our existing businesses acquisitions and investments changes in our deferred tax assets and liabilities including changes in our assessment of valuation allowances changes in the relevant tax laws or interpretations of these tax laws and developments in current and future tax examinations 

we only recognize the tax benefit of an income tax position if we judge that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained solely on its technical merits in a tax audit including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes to make this judgment we must interpret complex and sometimes ambiguous tax laws regulations and administrative practices if we judge that an income tax position meets this recognition threshold then we must measure the amount of the tax benefit to be recognized by estimating the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50 cumulative probability of being realized upon settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all of the relevant facts it is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts as this requires us to determine the probability of various possible settlement outcomes we must reevaluate our income tax positions on a quarterly basis to consider factors such as changes in facts or circumstances changes in tax law effectively settled issues under audit the lapse of applicable statute of limitations and new audit activity such a change in recognition or measurement would result in recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision for a more detailed description of our unrecognized tax benefits see note 6 in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition 

we begin to recognize revenue when all of the following criteria are met 

 significant judgment is involved in the determination of whether the facts and circumstances of an arrangement support that the fee for the arrangement is considered to be fixed or determinable and that collectibility of the fee is probable and these judgments can affect the amount of revenue that we recognize in a particular reporting period for installment contracts that do not include a substantial upfront payment we consider a fee to be fixed or determinable only if the arrangement has payment periods that are less than or equal to the term of the licenses and the payments are collected in equal or nearly equal installments when evaluated over the entire term of the arrangement if we no longer were to have a history of collecting under the original contract without providing concessions on term licenses revenue from term licenses would be required to be recognized when payments under the installment contract become due and payable such a change could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

we must also make judgments when assessing whether a contract amendment to a term arrangement primarily in the context of a license extension or renewal constitutes a concession we have established a history of collecting under contracts for which the fee has been assessed as fixed or determinable without providing concessions on payments products or services 

generally we are able to estimate whether collection is probable but significant judgment is applied as we assess the creditworthiness of our customers to make this determination key external and internal factors are considered in developing our creditworthiness assessment including public information historical and current financial statements and past collection history if our experience were to change it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations if in our judgment collection of a fee is not probable we do not record revenue until the uncertainty is removed which is generally upon receipt of cash payment 

revenue associated with term and subscription licenses is recognized ratably over the term of the license commencing upon the later of the effective date of the arrangement or delivery of the first software product in general product revenue associated with perpetual licenses where vendor specific objective evidence or vsoe exists for the undelivered maintenance is recognized up front upon the later of the effective date of the arrangement or delivery of the software product provided all other conditions for revenue recognition have been met and maintenance revenue is recognized ratably over the maintenance term if certain other criteria are met revenue for design ip is recognized upon delivery and we accrue the expected costs of maintenance a relatively small percentage of our revenue from software and ip licenses is recognized on an upfront basis 

our hardware products generally include the hardware product and its related essential software and maintenance for the hardware and the essential software consideration allocated to the hardware product and the essential software is recognized as revenue at the time of delivery provided all other conditions for revenue recognition have been met consideration allocated to the maintenance is recognized ratably over the maintenance term 

revenue from services and customized ip arrangements is recognized either on the time and materials method as work is performed or on the percentageofcompletion method if a service contract is considered to be part of a multiple element arrangement or mea that includes a software contract revenue is generally recognized ratably over the duration of the software contract for contracts with fixed or nottoexceed fees we estimate on a monthly basis the percentage of completion based on the completion of milestones relating to the arrangement we have a history of accurately estimating project status and the costs necessary to complete projects a number of internal and external factors can affect our estimates including labor rates utilization and efficiency variances and specification and testing requirement changes if different conditions were to prevail such that accurate estimates could not be made then the use of the completed contract method would be required and the recognition of all revenue and costs would be deferred until the project was completed such a change could have a material impact on our results of operations 

if a group of contracts is so closely related that they are in effect part of a single arrangement such arrangements are deemed to be an mea we exercise significant judgment to evaluate the relevant facts and circumstances in determining whether the separate contracts should be accounted for individually as distinct arrangements or whether the separate contracts are in substance an mea our judgments about whether a group of contracts is an mea can affect the timing of revenue recognition under those contracts which could have an effect on our results of operations for the periods involved for example a perpetual license agreement that would otherwise result in upfront revenue upon delivery may be deemed part of an mea when it is executed within close proximity or in contemplation of other license agreements that require ratable revenue recognition with the same customer in which event all the revenue is recognized over the longest term of any component of the mea instead of up front 

for an mea that includes software and nonsoftware elements we allocate consideration to all software elements as a group and all nonsoftware elements based on their relative standalone selling prices revenue allocated to each deliverable is then recognized when all four criteria are met in these circumstances there is a hierarchy to determine the standalone selling price to be used for allocating consideration to the deliverables as follows 

 we calculate the besp of our hardware products based on our pricing practices including the historical average prices charged for comparable hardware products because vsoe or tpe cannot be established our process for determining besp for our software deliverables without vsoe or tpe takes into account multiple factors that vary depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each deliverable key external and internal factors considered in developing the besps include prices charged by us for similar arrangements historical pricing practices and the nature of the product in addition when developing besps we may consider other factors as appropriate including the pricing of competitive alternatives if they exist and productspecific business objectives we exercise significant judgment to evaluate the relevant facts and circumstances in calculating the besp of the deliverables in our arrangements 

business combinations 

when we acquire businesses we allocate the purchase price to the acquired tangible assets and assumed liabilities including deferred revenue liabilities associated with the fair value of contingent consideration and acquired identifiable intangible assets any residual purchase price is recorded as goodwill the allocation of the purchase price requires us to make significant estimates in determining the fair values of these acquired assets and assumed liabilities especially with respect to intangible assets and goodwill these estimates are based on information obtained from management of the acquired companies our assessment of this information and historical experience these estimates can include but are not limited to the cash flows that an acquired business is expected to generate in the future the cash flows that specific assets acquired with that business are expected to generate in the future the appropriate weightedaverage cost of capital and the cost savings expected to be derived from acquiring an asset these estimates are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and if different estimates were used the purchase price for the acquisition could be allocated to the acquired assets and assumed liabilities differently from the allocation that we have made to the acquired assets and assumed liabilities in addition unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that may affect the accuracy or validity of such estimates and if such events occur we may be required to adjust the value allocated to acquired assets or assumed liabilities 

we also make significant judgments and estimates when we assign useful lives to the definitelived intangible assets identified as part of our acquisitions these estimates are inherently uncertain and if we used different estimates the useful life over which we amortize intangible assets would be different in addition unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that may impact the useful life assigned to our intangible assets which would impact our amortization of intangible assets expense and our results of operations 

fair value of financial instruments 

on a quarterly basis we measure at fair value certain financial assets and liabilities inputs to valuation techniques are observable or unobservable observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources while unobservable inputs reflect our market assumptions 

while we believe the observable and unobservable inputs we use to measure the fair value are reasonable different inputs or estimates may materially impact the resulting fair value measurements of these instruments and may also impact our results of operations for an additional description of our fair value measurements see note 16 in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

new accounting standards 

 for information regarding new accounting standards applicable to us see note 2 in the notes to consolidated financial statements under the heading “new accounting standards” 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

foreign currency risk 

a material portion of our revenue expenses and business activities are transacted in the us dollar in certain foreign countries where we price our products and services in us dollars a decrease in value of the local currency relative to the us dollar results in an increase in the prices for our products and services compared to those products of our competitors that are priced in local currency this could result in our prices being uncompetitive in certain markets 

in certain countries where we may invoice customers in the local currency japan in particular our revenues benefit from a weaker dollar and are adversely affected by a stronger dollar the opposite impact occurs in countries where we record expenses in local currencies in those cases our costs and expenses benefit from a stronger dollar and are adversely affected by a weaker dollar the fluctuations in our operating expenses outside the united states resulting from volatility in foreign exchange rates are not generally moderated by corresponding fluctuations in revenues from existing contracts except for our operations in japan because we receive some cash payments and make most expense payments in japanese yen 

we enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to protect against currency exchange risks associated with existing assets and liabilities a foreign currency forward exchange contract acts as a hedge by increasing in value when underlying assets decrease in value or underlying liabilities increase in value due to changes in foreign exchange rates conversely a foreign currency forward exchange contract decreases in value when underlying assets increase in value or underlying liabilities decrease in value due to changes in foreign exchange rates these forward contracts are not designated as accounting hedges so the unrealized gains and losses are recognized in other income net in advance of the actual foreign currency cash flows with the fair value of these forward contracts being recorded as accrued liabilities or other current assets 

we do not use forward contracts for trading purposes our forward contracts generally have maturities of 90 days or less we enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts based on estimated future asset and liability exposures and the effectiveness of our hedging program depends on our ability to estimate these future asset and liability exposures recognized gains and losses with respect to our current hedging activities will ultimately depend on how accurately we are able to match the amount of foreign currency forward exchange contracts with actual underlying asset and liability exposures 

the following table provides information about our foreign currency forward exchange contracts as of january 2 2016  the information is provided in united states dollar equivalent amounts the table presents the notional amounts at contract exchange rates and the weighted average contractual foreign currency exchange rates expressed as units of the foreign currency per united states dollar which in some cases may not be the market convention for quoting a particular currency all of these forward contracts mature before or during february 2016  



while we actively monitor our foreign currency risks there can be no assurance that our foreign currency hedging activities will substantially offset the impact of fluctuations in currency exchange rates on our results of operations cash flows and financial position 

interest rate risk 

our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our portfolio of marketable debt securities our portfolio of cash and cash equivalents and outstanding balances drawn on our revolving credit facility if any 

we are exposed to interest rate fluctuations in many of the world’s leading industrialized countries but the fair value of our marketable debt securities and our interest income and expense is most sensitive to fluctuations in the general level of united states interest rates in this regard changes in united states interest rates affect the interest earned on our marketable debt securities and cash and cash equivalents any unrealized and realized gains or losses on our marketable debt securities and the costs associated with foreign currency hedges pursuant to our investment policy we limit the amount of our credit exposure to any one issuer other than in securities issued by the united states treasury and united states government agencies 

our shortterm investments as of january 2 2016  include 923 million  of marketable debt securities that may decline in value if market interest rates rise such variability in market interest rates may result in a negative impact on the results of our investment activities as of january 2 2016  an increase in the market rates of interest of 1 would result in a decrease in the fair values of our marketable debt securities by approximately 08 million  

all highly liquid securities with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase are considered to be cash equivalents securities with maturities greater than three months are classified as availableforsale and are considered to be shortterm investments the carrying value of our interestbearing instruments approximated fair value as of january 2 2016  

interest rates under our revolving credit facility are variable so interest expense for periods when the credit facility is utilized could be adversely affected by changes in interest rates interest rates under our revolving credit facility can fluctuate based on changes in market interest rates and in an interest rate margin that varies based on our consolidated leverage ratio as of january 2 2016  we had no  outstanding balance under our revolving credit facility for additional description of this revolving credit facility see note 3 in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

equity price risk 

equity investments 

we have a portfolio of equity investments that includes marketable equity securities and nonmarketable investments our equity investments are made primarily in connection with our strategic investment program under our strategic investment program from time to time we make cash investments in companies with technologies that are potentially strategically important to us see note 4 in the notes to consolidated financial statements for an additional description of these investments our nonmarketable investments had a carrying value of 39 million  as of january 2 2016  and 61 million  as of january 3 2015  




 item 9 changes in and disagreements with accountants on accounting and financial disclosure 

none 




 item 9a controls and procedures 

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

as required by rule 13a15 of the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended or the exchange act under the supervision and with the participation of our management including our chief executive officer or ceo and our chief financial officer or cfo we evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rules 13a15e and 15d15e under the exchange act as of january 2 2016  

the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures included a review of our processes and the effect on the information generated for use in this annual report on form 10k in the course of this evaluation we sought to identify any material weaknesses in our disclosure controls and procedures to determine whether we had identified any acts of fraud involving personnel who have a significant role in our disclosure controls and procedures and to confirm that any necessary corrective action including process improvements was taken this type of evaluation is done every fiscal quarter so that our conclusions concerning the effectiveness of these controls can be reported in our periodic reports filed with the sec the overall goals of these evaluation activities are to monitor our disclosure controls and procedures and to make modifications as necessary we intend to maintain these disclosure controls and procedures modifying them as circumstances warrant 

based on their evaluation as of january 2 2016  our ceo and cfo have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by us in our reports filed or submitted under the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the sec’s rules and forms and is accumulated and communicated to our management including the ceo and cfo as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure 

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the fiscal quarter ended january 2 2016  that materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting 

inherent limitations on effectiveness of controls 

our management including our ceo and cfo does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud internal control over financial reporting no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of internal control are met further the design of internal control must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of the control must be considered relative to their costs while our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance of their effectiveness because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within cadence have been detected 

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rule 13a15f under the exchange act our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of january 2 2016  in making this assessment our management used the criteria established in internal controlintegrated framework 2013 issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission or coso our management has concluded that as of january 2 2016  our internal control over financial reporting is effective based on these criteria our independent registered public accounting firm kpmg llp has issued an attestation report on our internal control over financial reporting which is included in part iv item 15 “exhibits and financial statement schedules”

the eda and ip industries as drivers for our business 

our system design enablement strategy is to deliver the technologies necessary for integrated system and soc design with an end product in mind at the heart of this strategy is our growing core eda business which is complemented by opportunities to expand our business in ip system interconnect and analysis system level design and hardwaresoftware development 

our business serves eda and ip customers including electronics systems and semiconductor companies internet service providers and other technology companies that are driven by enduser demand for electronics systems ics and devices that are smaller use less power and provide more functionality to meet this demand our customers design and develop new ics and electronic devices and systems using our products and services accordingly our business depends on our customers’ continued investment in new designs and products 

the markets our customers serve are sensitive to product price performance and the time it takes to bring their products to market in order to be competitive and profitable in these markets our customers demand high levels of productivity from their design teams better predictability in shorter development schedules high performance products and lower development and manufacturing costs semiconductor and electronics systems companies are responding to these challenges and users’ demand for increased functionality and smaller devices by combining subsystems such as radio frequency or rf wireless communication signal processing microprocessors and memory controllers onto a single silicon chip creating a systemonchip or soc or combining multiple chips into a single chip package in a format referred to as systeminpackage or sip the trend toward subsystem integration has required these chip makers to find solutions to challenges previously addressed by system companies such as verifying systemlevel functionality and hardwaresoftware interoperability and has driven the need for incorporation of preverified commercial ip into these systems in addition whole systems must be designed and verified made up of many component socs and software and must be analyzed for performance in enduser operating scenarios 

significant issues that our customers face in creating their products include designing and verifying whole systems including software reducing power consumption manufacturing microscopic circuitry verifying device functionality and achieving technical performance targets all while meeting aggressive timetomarket and cost requirements we must deliver products that address these technical challenges while improving the productivity predictability reliability and profitability of the design processes and products of their customers

product and maintenance and services revenue 

revenue and revenue as a percentage of total revenue from our product and maintenance and services offerings for the last three fiscal years were as follows 



for an additional description of our product and maintenance and services revenue see the discussion under “results of operations” under part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” 

marketing and sales 

we generally market our products and provide services to existing and prospective customers through a direct sales force consisting of sales people and applications engineers applications engineers provide technical presales and postsales support for our products due to the complexity of many of our products and the system design process the sales cycle is generally long requiring three to six months or more during the sales cycle our direct sales force generally provides technical presentations product demonstrations and support for onsite customer evaluation of our solutions we also promote our products and services through advertising direct mail trade shows public relations and the internet we selectively utilize valueadded resellers to broaden our reach and reduce cost of sales orcad and certain allegro products are primarily marketed through these channels with respect to international sales we generally market and support our products and services through our subsidiaries we also use a thirdparty distributor to sell our products and services to certain customers in japan 

product arrangements 

we license software and ip using three license types term subscription and perpetual customers who prefer to license technology for a specified limited period of time will choose either a term or subscription license and customers who prefer to have the right to use the technology continuously without time restriction will choose a perpetual license customers who desire to use new software technology during the life of the contract will select a subscription license which allows them limited access to unspecified new technology on a whenandifavailable basis as opposed to a term or perpetual license which does not include the right to use new technology payment terms for term and subscription licenses generally provide for payments to be made over the license period and payment terms for perpetual licenses generally are net 30 days 

our emulation hardware products are either sold or leased to our customers 

we generally license our design ip under nonexclusive license agreements that provide usage rights for specific designs in addition for certain of our ip license agreements we collect royalties as our customers ship their product that includes our ip to their customers 

for a further description of our license agreements our emulation hardware sale or lease agreements revenue recognition policies and results of operations please refer to the discussion under “critical accounting estimates” under part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” 

backlog 

our backlog was approximately  21 billion  and 19 billion  as of january 3 2015  and december 28 2013  respectively our backlog as of january 3 2015  consisted of fully executed arrangements with effective dates commencing no later than january 3 2015  with revenue to be recognized thereafter and included a variety of types generally including but not limited to 

 5 

 the substantial majority of our backlog consists of customer contracts for which product and maintenance revenue is recognized ratably or on a recurring basis over the contract life historically we have not experienced significant cancellations of our contracts with customers for engineering services contracts in backlog completion dates are occasionally rescheduled delaying revenue recognition under those contracts beyond the original anticipated completion date changes in customer license types or payment terms also can affect the timing of revenue recognition during fiscal 2014  approximately 70  of our revenue came from arrangements that were in backlog as of december 28 2013  we expect approximately 12 billion  or approximately 70  of our fiscal 2015 revenue to come from arrangements that were in backlog as of january 3 2015  the actual percentage of revenue coming from backlog during fiscal 2015 may change if our actual business levels in fiscal 2015 are different than our current expectations 

research and development 

our research and development expense was 6030 million  during fiscal 2014  5340 million  during fiscal 2013  and 4541 million  during fiscal 2012  

the primary areas of our research and development include the following 

 our future performance depends on our ability to innovate commercialize newly developed solutions and enhance and maintain our current products we must keep pace with our customers’ technical developments satisfy industry standards and meet our customers’ increasingly demanding performance productivity quality and predictability requirements therefore we expect to continue to invest in research and development 

manufacturing and software distribution 

we perform final assembly and testing of our emulation hardware products at our headquarters in san jose california subcontractors manufacture all major subassemblies including all individual pcbs and custom ics and supply them for qualification and testing before their incorporation into the assembled product 

software and documentation are primarily distributed to customers by secure electronic delivery or on dvd 

proprietary technology 

our success depends in part upon our proprietary technology we generally rely on patents copyrights trademarks and trade secret laws licenses and restrictive agreements to establish and protect our proprietary rights in technology and products many of our products include software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties we may have to seek new licenses or renew existing licenses for thirdparty software and other intellectual property in the future as part of performing engineering services for customers our engineering services business uses certain software and other intellectual property licensed from third parties including that of our competitors 

competition 

we compete in eda most frequently with synopsys inc and mentor graphics corporation but also with numerous other eda providers such as ansys inc atrenta inc atoptech inc zuken ltd and many others offering “point solutions” with manufacturers of electronic devices that have developed acquired or have the capability to develop their own eda products and with numerous electronics design and consulting companies in the area of design ip we compete with synopsys inc ceva inc and numerous other ip companies 

certain competitive factors in the engineering services business differ from those of the products businesses while we compete with other eda companies in the engineering services business our principal competitors include independent engineering service businesses many of these companies are also customers and therefore use our product offerings in the delivery of their services or products 

international operations 

we have 56  sales offices design centers and research and development facilities approximately 66  of which are located outside of the united states we primarily consider customer sales and support requirements the availability of a skilled workforce and costs and efficiencies among other relative benefits when determining what operations to locate internationally for additional information relating to our international operations including revenue and longlived assets by geographic area see note 19 in the notes to consolidated financial statements for risks related to our international operations see the discussion under “the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations may adversely impact our financial condition” and “risks associated with our international operations could seriously harm our financial condition”   under item 1a “risk factors”

 item 1a risk factors 

our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties including those described in the sections below that could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations cash flows and the trading price of our common stock 

risks related to our business 

uncertainty in the global economy in general and any potential downturn in the semiconductor and electronics industries in particular may negatively impact our business and reduce our bookings levels and revenue 

purchases of our products and services are dependent upon the commencement of new design projects by ic manufacturers and electronics systems companies the ic and electronics systems industries are cyclical and are characterized by constant and rapid technological change rapid product obsolescence and price erosion evolving standards short product life cycles and wide fluctuations in product supply and demand 

the ic and electronics systems industries have also experienced significant downturns in connection with or in anticipation of maturing product cycles of both these industries’ and their customers’ products while spending on eda products and services has grown in recent years the current outlook for the semiconductor industry is uncertain and may result in a decrease in spending on eda products and services 

while we cannot predict global economic conditions uncertainty about future economic conditions and future decline in consumer spending could negatively impact our customers’ businesses reducing the number of new chip designs and their overall research and development spending including their spending on eda products and services and as a result decrease demand for our products decreased bookings for our products and services customer bankruptcies consolidation among our customers or problems or delays with our hardware suppliers or with the supply or delivery of our emulation hardware products could also adversely affect our ability to grow our business or adversely affect our future revenues and financial results our future business and financial results are subject to considerable uncertainty that could impact our stock price if economic conditions deteriorate in the future or in particular if semiconductor industry revenues do not grow or our suppliers of our hardware components and products are subject to problems or delays our future revenues and financial results could be adversely affected however if economic conditions improve for our customers the positive impact on our revenues and financial results may be deferred due to cautious customer research and development spending and our mix of licenses that result in recurring revenue 

our failure to respond quickly to technological developments or customers’ increasing technological requirements could make our products uncompetitive and obsolete 

the industries in which we compete experience rapid technology developments rapid changes in industry standards and customer requirements and frequent introductions and improvements of new products currently the industries we serve are experiencing the following trends 

 9 

 if we are unable to respond quickly and successfully to these trends we may lose our competitive position and our products or technologies may become obsolete to compete successfully we must develop acquire or license new products and improve our existing products and processes on a schedule that keeps pace with technological developments and the requirements for products addressing a broad spectrum of designers and designer expertise in our industries our emulation hardware platforms must be enhanced periodically to reduce the likelihood that a competitor surpasses the capabilities we offer our introduction of new products could reduce the demand and revenue of our older products or affect their pricing we must also be able to support a range of changing computer software hardware platforms and customer preferences a rapid transition to different business models associated with cloud computing technologies could result in reduced revenue we cannot guarantee that we will be successful in keeping pace with all or any of the customer trends 

we have experienced varied operating results and our operating results for any particular fiscal period are affected by the timing of revenue recognition particularly for our emulation hardware and ip products 

we have recorded net losses in the past and may record net losses in the future various factors affect our operating results and some of them are not within our control our operating results for any period are also affected by the timing of revenue recognition particularly for our emulation hardware and ip products 

a substantial portion of the product revenue related to our emulation hardware business is recognized upon delivery and our forecasted revenue results are based in part on our expectations of emulation hardware to be delivered in a particular quarter therefore changes in emulation hardware bookings or deliveries relative to expectations will have a more immediate impact on our revenue than changes in software or services bookings for which revenue is generally recognized over time 

in recent years we made significant investments to expand our ip offerings through among other things research and development and acquisitions as we continue to expand our ip offerings a portion of the revenue related to our ip bookings will be deferred until we complete and deliver the licensed ip to our customers as a result costs related to the research and development of the ip may be incurred prior to the recognition of the related revenue 

revenue related to our emulation hardware and ip products is inherently difficult to predict because sales of our emulation hardware and ip products depend on the commencement of new projects for the design and development of complex ics and systems by our customers our customers’ willingness to expend capital to deploy our emulation hardware or ip products in those projects and the availability of our emulation hardware or ip products for delivery therefore our emulation hardware or ip sales may be delayed or may decrease if our customers delay or cancel projects because their spending is constrained or if there are problems or delays with the supply or delivery of our emulation hardware or ip products or our hardware suppliers moreover the emulation hardware and ip markets are highly competitive and our customers may choose to purchase a competitor’s hardware or ip product based on cost performance or other factors these factors may result in lower revenue which would have an adverse effect on our business results of operations or cash flows 

our software license mix is such that a substantial proportion of licenses require ratable revenue recognition and we expect the license mix combined with the modest growth in spending by our customers in the semiconductor sector may make it difficult for us to rapidly increase our revenue in future fiscal periods the timing of our revenue recognition may be deferred until payments become due and payable from customers with nonlinear payment terms or as cash is collected from customers with low credit ratings 

we plan our operating expenses based on forecasted revenue expected business needs and other factors these expenses and the effect of longterm commitments are relatively fixed in the short term bookings and the related revenue are harder to forecast in a difficult economic environment if the macroeconomic environment weakens and we experience a shortfall in bookings our operating results could differ from our expectations because we may not be able to quickly reduce our expenses in response to shortterm business changes 

the methods estimates and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies have a significant impact on our results of operations see “critical accounting estimates” under part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” such methods estimates and judgments are by their nature subject to substantial risks uncertainties and assumptions and factors may arise over time that may lead us to change our methods estimates and judgments changes in those methods estimates and judgments could significantly affect our results of operations 

historical results of operations should not be viewed as reliable indicators of our future performance if our revenue operating results or business outlook for future periods fall short of the levels expected by us securities analysts or investors the trading price of our common stock could decline 

we depend on sole suppliers for certain hardware components making us vulnerable to supply disruption and price fluctuation 

we depend on sole suppliers for certain hardware components our reliance on sole suppliers could result in product delivery problems and delays and reduced control over product pricing and quality though we prefer to have multiple sources to procure certain key components in some cases it is not practical or feasible to do so we may suffer a disruption in the supply of certain hardware components if we are unable to purchase sufficient components on a timely basis or at all for any reason any supply disruption including delay in delivery of components by our suppliers or the bankruptcy or shutdown of our suppliers could delay our production process and prevent us from delivering completed emulation hardware products to customers or from supplying new evaluation units to customers which could have a negative impact on our revenue and operating results 

we have acquired and expect to acquire other companies and businesses and may not realize the expected benefits of these acquisitions 

we have acquired and expect to acquire other companies and businesses during fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2013 we acquired multiple businesses in order to expand our ip business and other product offerings our future revenue growth and expansion of our ip business is heavily dependent on our successful integration of these and other acquisitions we may incur significant costs in connection with potential transactions including acquisitions that are not consummated potential and completed acquisitions involve a number of risks if any of the following acquisitionrelated risks occur our business operating results or financial condition could be seriously harmed 

 in a number of our completed acquisitions we have agreed to make future payments either in the form of employee retention bonuses or contingent purchase price payments based on the performance of the acquired companies businesses or the employees who joined us with the acquired companies or businesses the performance goals pursuant to which these future payments may be made generally relate to the achievement by the acquired company or business or by the employees who joined us with the acquired company or business of certain specified bookings revenue run rate product proliferation product development or employee retention goals during a specified period following completion of the applicable acquisition the specific performance goal levels and amounts and timing of employee bonuses or contingent purchase price payments vary with each acquisition we may continue to use contingent purchase price payments in connection with acquisitions in the future and while we expect to derive value from an acquisition in excess of such contingent payment obligations we may be required to make certain contingent payments without deriving the anticipated value 

future acquisitions may involve issuances of stock as full or partial payment of the purchase price for the acquired company or business grants of restricted stock restricted stock units or stock options to employees of the acquired companies or businesses which may be dilutive to existing stockholders expenditure of substantial cash resources or the incurrence of a material amount of debt these arrangements may impact our liquidity financial position and results of operations 

we have invested and expect to continue to invest in research and development efforts for new and existing products and technologies and technical sales support such investments may affect our operating results and if the return on these investments is lower or develops more slowly than we expect our revenue and operating results may suffer 

we have invested and expect to continue to invest in research and development for new and existing products technologies and services in response to our customers’ increasing technological requirements such as the migration to advanced process nodes and the introduction of finfets such investments may be in related areas such as technical sales support these investments may involve significant time risks and uncertainties including the risk that the expenses associated with these investments may affect our margins and operating results and that such investments may not generate sufficient revenues to offset liabilities assumed and expenses associated with these new investments we believe that we must continue to invest a significant amount of time and resources in our research and development efforts and technical sales support to maintain and improve our competitive position if we do not achieve the benefits anticipated from these investments or if the achievement of these benefits is delayed our revenue and operating results may be adversely affected 

the competition in our industries is substantial and we may not be able to continue to successfully compete in our industries 

the eda industry the commercial electronics engineering services industry and the ip industry are highly competitive if we fail to compete successfully in these industries it could seriously harm our business operating results or financial condition to compete in these industries we must identify and develop or acquire innovative and costcompetitive eda products integrate them into platforms and market them in a timely manner we may not be able to compete successfully in these industries factors that could affect our ability to compete successfully include 

 we compete in eda most frequently with synopsys inc and mentor graphics corporation but also with numerous other eda providers such as ansys inc atrenta inc atoptech inc zuken ltd and many others offering “point solutions” with manufacturers of electronic devices that have developed acquired or have the capability to develop their own eda products and with numerous electronics design and consulting companies in the area of design ip we compete with synopsys inc ceva inc and numerous other ip companies 

competitive pressures may require us to change our pricing which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

the highly competitive markets in which we do business can put pressure on us to reduce the prices of our software emulation hardware and ip if our competitors offer deep discounts on certain products in an effort to recapture or gain market share or to sell other software or hardware products we may then need to lower our prices or offer other favorable terms to compete successfully any such changes would be likely to reduce our profit margins and could adversely affect our operating results any substantial changes to our prices and pricing policies could cause sales revenues to decline or be delayed as our sales force implements and our customers adjust to the new pricing policies some of our competitors bundle products for promotional purposes or as a longterm pricing strategy or provide guarantees of prices and product implementations these practices could over time significantly constrain the prices that we can charge for our products if we cannot offset price reductions with a corresponding increase in the number of sales or with lower spending then the reduced revenues resulting from lower prices could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations may adversely impact our revenue expenses cash flows and financial condition 

we have significant operations outside the united states our revenue from international operations as a percentage of total revenue was approximately 56  during fiscal 2014  56  during fiscal 2013  and 57  during fiscal 2012  respectively we expect that revenue from our international operations will continue to account for a significant portion of our total revenue we also transact business in various foreign currencies the volatility of foreign currencies in certain countries where we conduct business most notably the japanese yen european union euro and indian rupee have had and may in the future have an effect on our revenue or operating results 

fluctuations in the rate of exchange between the united states or us dollar and the currencies of other countries where we conduct business could seriously affect our business operating results or financial condition for example when a foreign currency declines in value relative to the us dollar it takes more of the foreign currency to purchase the same amount of us dollars than before the change if we price our products and services in the foreign currency we receive fewer us dollars than we did before the change if we price our products and services in us dollars the decrease in value of the local currency results in an increase in the price for our products and services compared to those products of our competitors that are priced in local currency this could result in our prices being uncompetitive in markets where business is transacted in the local currency on the other hand when a foreign currency increases in value relative to the us dollar it takes more us dollars to purchase the same amount of the foreign currency as we use the foreign currency to fund payroll costs and other operating expenses in our international operations this results in an increase in operating expenses approximately 30 of our total costs and expenses are transacted in foreign currencies our attempts to reduce the effect of foreign currency fluctuations may be unsuccessful and significant exchange rate movements may adversely impact our results of operations as expressed in us dollars 

our stock price has been subject to fluctuations and may continue to be subject to fluctuations 

the market price of our common stock has experienced fluctuations and may fluctuate or decline in the future and as a result you could lose the value of your investment the market price of our common stock may be affected by a number of factors including but not limited to 

 in addition equity markets in general and the equities of technology companies in particular have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations such price and volume fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock for reasons unrelated to our business or operating results 

our future revenue is dependent in part upon our installed customer base continuing to license or buy additional products and purchase additional services 

our installed customer base has traditionally generated additional new license service and maintenance revenues in future periods customers may not necessarily license or buy additional products or contract for additional services or maintenance our customers many of which are large semiconductor and systems companies often have significant bargaining power in negotiations with us mergers or acquisitions of our customers can reduce the total level of purchases of our software hardware and services and in some cases increase customers’ bargaining power in negotiations with their suppliers including us 

litigation could adversely affect our financial condition or operations 

we currently are and in the future may be involved in various disputes and litigation that arise in the ordinary course of business these include disputes and lawsuits related to intellectual property including customer indemnification mergers and acquisitions licensing contracts distribution arrangements and employee relations matters for information regarding the litigation matters in which we are currently engaged please refer to the discussion under item 3 “legal proceedings” and note 16 in the notes to consolidated financial statements we cannot provide any assurances that the final outcome of these lawsuits or any other proceedings that may arise in the future will not have a material adverse effect on our business operating results financial condition or cash flows litigation can be time consuming and expensive and could divert management’s time and attention from our business which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and operating results 

risks associated with our international operations could seriously harm our financial condition 

a significant amount of our revenue is derived from our international operations and we have offices throughout the world including key research and development facilities outside of the united states our international operations may be subject to a number of risks including 

 some of our international research and development and other facilities are in parts of the world where there may be a greater risk of business interruption as a result of political instability terrorist acts or military conflicts than businesses located domestically furthermore this potential harm is exacerbated because damage to or disruptions at our international research and development facilities could have a more significant adverse effect on our ability to develop new or improve existing products than other businesses that may only have sales offices or other less critical operations abroad we are not insured for losses or interruptions caused by acts of war furthermore our operations are dependent upon the connectivity of our operations throughout the world activities that interfere with our international connectivity such as cyber hacking the introduction of a virus into our computer systems or natural disasters near any of our international locations could significantly interfere with our business operations 

in addition internal controls policies and procedures and employee training and compliance programs that we have implemented to deter prohibited practices may not prevent our employees contractors or agents from violating or circumventing our policies and the laws and regulations applicable to our worldwide operations 

we depend upon our management team and key employees and our failure to attract train motivate and retain management and key employees may make us less competitive and therefore harm our results of operations 

our business depends upon the continued services efforts and abilities of our senior management and other key employees competition for highly skilled executive officers and employees can be intense particularly in geographic areas recognized as high technology centers such as the silicon valley area where our principal offices are located and in other locations where we maintain facilities in addition competition for qualified personnel in the eda commercial electronics engineering services and ip industries has intensified we may also experience increased compensation costs that are not offset by either improved productivity or higher sales we may not be successful in recruiting new personnel and in retaining and motivating existing personnel from time to time there may be changes in our management team resulting from the hiring and departure of executive officers and as a result we may experience disruption to our business that may harm our operating results and our relationships with our employees customers and suppliers may be adversely affected 

to attract retain and motivate individuals with the requisite expertise we may be required to grant large numbers of stock options or other stockbased incentive awards which may be dilutive to existing stockholders and increase compensation expense and pay significant base salaries and cash bonuses which could harm our operating results the high cost of training new employees not fully utilizing these employees or losing trained employees to competing employers could also reduce our operating margins and harm our business or operating results 

in addition applicable rules and regulations require stockholder approval for new equity compensation plans and significant amendments to existing equity compensation plans including increases in shares available for issuance under such plans and prohibit publiclytraded companies from giving a proxy to vote on equity compensation plans unless the beneficial owner of the shares has given voting instructions these rules and regulations could make it more difficult for us to grant equity compensation to employees in the future to the extent that these regulations make it more difficult or expensive to grant equity compensation to employees we may incur increased compensation costs or find it difficult to attract retain and motivate employees which could materially and adversely affect our business 

we could suffer serious harm to our business because of the infringement of our intellectual property rights by third parties or because of our infringement of the intellectual property rights of third parties 

there are numerous eda vip design ip and tensilica ip productrelated patents new patents are being issued at a rapid rate and are owned by eda companies as well as entities and individuals outside the eda industry including parties whose income is primarily derived from infringementrelated litigation it is not always practicable to determine in advance whether a product or any of its components infringes the patent rights of others as a result from time to time we may be compelled to respond to or prosecute intellectual property infringement claims to protect our rights or defend a customer’s rights 

intellectual property infringement claims including contractual defense reimbursement obligations related to thirdparty claims against our customers regardless of merit could consume valuable management time result in costly litigation or cause product shipment delays all of which could seriously harm our business operating results or financial condition the risk of infringement and related indemnification claims associated with design ip products that are incorporated into a customer product broadly used by consumers may be higher than the risk associated with our software products in settling these claims we may be required to enter into royalty or licensing agreements with the third parties claiming infringement these royalty or licensing agreements if available may not have terms favorable to us being compelled to enter into a license agreement with unfavorable terms could seriously harm our business operating results or financial condition any potential intellectual property litigation could compel us to do one or more of the following 

 if we were compelled to take any of these actions our business or operating results may suffer 

we rely on our proprietary technology as well as software and other intellectual property rights licensed to us by third parties and we cannot assure you that the precautions taken to protect our rights will be adequate or that we will continue to be able to adequately secure such intellectual property rights from third parties 

our success depends in part upon our proprietary technology we generally rely on patents copyrights trademarks trade secrets licenses and restrictive agreements to establish and protect our proprietary rights in technology and products despite the precautions we may take to protect our intellectual property third parties have tried in the past and may try in the future to challenge invalidate or circumvent these safeguards our patents and other intellectual property rights may not provide us with sufficient competitive advantages patents may not be issued on any of our pending applications and our issued patents may not be sufficiently broad to protect our technology furthermore the laws of foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights in those countries to the same extent as applicable law protects these rights in the united states the protection of our intellectual property may require the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources moreover the steps we take to protect our intellectual property may not adequately protect our rights or deter or prevent third parties from infringing or misappropriating our proprietary rights 

many of our products include software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties we may have to seek new or renew existing licenses for such software and other intellectual property in the future our engineering services business holds licenses to certain software and other intellectual property owned by third parties including that of our competitors our failure to obtain software other intellectual property licenses or other intellectual property rights that are necessary or helpful for our business on favorable terms or our need to engage in litigation over these licenses or rights could seriously harm our business operating results or financial condition 

our operating results and revenue could be adversely affected by customer payment delays customer bankruptcies and defaults or modifications of licenses 

occasionally our customers file for bankruptcy or request to modify license terms if our customers experience adversity in their business they may delay or default on their payment obligations to us file for bankruptcy or modify or cancel plans to license our products for instance if our customers are not successful in generating sufficient cash or are precluded from securing financing they may not be able to pay or may delay payment of accounts receivable that are owed to us although these obligations are generally not cancelable our customers’ inability to fulfill payment obligations in turn may adversely affect our revenue and cash flow additionally our customers have in the past sought and may in the future seek to renegotiate preexisting contractual commitments payment defaults by our customers or significant reductions in existing contractual commitments could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results because of the relatively high levels of volatility that continue to drive significant fluctuations in asset prices as well as concern regarding high levels of leverage in sovereign and corporate debt the capital and credit markets are volatile and unpredictable if we were to seek funding from the capital or credit markets in response to any material level of customer defaults we may not be able to secure funding on terms acceptable to us or at all which may have a material negative effect on our business 

if our security measures are breached and an unauthorized party obtains access to customer data or our proprietary business information our information systems may be perceived as being unsecure which could harm our business and reputation 

our products and services involve the storage and transmission of our proprietary information and that of our customers we have offices throughout the world including key research and development facilities outside of the united states our operations are dependent upon the connectivity of our operations throughout the world despite our security measures our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to cyber attacks or breached due to an employee error or other disruption that could result in unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information and could significantly interfere with our business operations breaches of our security measures could expose us to a risk of loss or misuse of this information litigation and potential liability because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage information systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventive measures in addition if we select a vendor that uses cyber storage of information as part of their service or product offerings despite our attempts to validate the security of such services our proprietary information may be misappropriated by third parties in the event of an actual or perceived breach of our security or the security of one of our vendors the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed and we could suffer damage to our reputation or our business or lose existing customers and our ability to obtain new customers 

the long sales cycle of our products and services may cause our operating results to fluctuate unexpectedly 

generally we have a long sales cycle that can extend up to six months or longer the complexity and expense associated with our products and services generally require a lengthy customer education evaluation and approval process consequently we may incur substantial expenses and devote significant management effort and expense to develop potential relationships that do not result in agreements or revenue and may prevent us from pursuing other opportunities 

in addition sales of our products and services have been and may in the future be delayed if customers delay approval or commencement of projects because of 

 long sales cycles for hardware products subject us to a number of significant risks over which we have limited control including insufficient excess or obsolete inventory variations in inventory valuation and fluctuations in quarterly operating results 

we have substantial cash requirements in the united states but a significant portion of our cash is held and generated outside of the united states and if our cash available in the united states and the cash available under our revolving credit facility is insufficient to meet our operating expenses and debt repayment obligations in the united states then we may be required to raise cash in ways that could negatively affect our financial condition results of operations and the market price of our common stock 

we have significant operations outside the united states as of january 3 2015  approximately 45  of our cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments balance was held by subsidiaries outside the united states with the remainder of the balance held by us or our subsidiaries in the united states we believe that the combination of our existing us cash cash equivalents future us operating cash flows and cash available under our revolving credit facility are sufficient to meet our ongoing us operating expenses and debt repayment obligations however if these sources of cash were insufficient to meet our future funding obligations in the united states we could be required to seek other available funding sources which could negatively impact our results of operations financial position and the market price of our common stock 

the investment of our cash cash equivalents and investments in money market funds and marketable debt securities are subject to risks which may cause losses and affect the liquidity of these investments 

our investments include various money market funds and marketable debt securities such as corporate debt securities us treasury securities us government agency securities bank certificates of deposit and commercial paper weakened financial markets have at times adversely impacted the general credit liquidity market prices and interest rates for these and other types of debt securities additionally changes in monetary policy by the federal open market committee and concerns about the rising us government debt level may cause a decrease in the purchasing power of the us dollar and adversely affect our investment portfolio furthermore if there is a default or downgrade of us government or agency debt securities our investment portfolio may be adversely impacted requiring impairment charges that could adversely affect our liquidity financial position results of operations or cash flows the financial market and monetary risks associated with our investment portfolio may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition liquidity results of operations or cash flows 

our operating results could be adversely affected as a result of changes in our effective tax rates or by material differences between our forecasted annual effective tax rates and actual tax rates 

our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by the following 

 any significant change in our future effective tax rates could adversely impact our results of operations for future periods tax laws in the various jurisdictions where we have operations may be subject to significant change in the future based on the current economic and political environment the united states and many other countries are actively considering fundamental changes to the tax laws applicable to multinational corporations which could impact our future effective tax rates 

forecasts of our annual effective tax rate are complex and subject to uncertainty because our income tax position for each year combines the effects of estimating our annual income or loss the mix of profits and losses earned by us and our subsidiaries in tax jurisdictions with a broad range of income tax rates as well as benefits from available deferred tax assets the impact of various accounting rules and results of tax audits forecasts of our annual effective tax rate do not include the anticipation of future tax law changes if there were a material difference between forecasted and actual tax rates then it could have a material impact on our results of operations 

our reported financial results may be adversely affected by changes in united states generally accepted accounting principles and we may incur significant costs to adjust our accounting systems and processes to comply with significant changes 

united states generally accepted accounting principles are subject to interpretation by the financial accounting standards board or fasb the american institute of certified public accountants the sec and various bodies formed to promulgate and interpret appropriate accounting principles during fiscal 2014 the fasb issued a new accounting standard related to revenue recognition which could change the way we account for certain of our sales transactions the future adoption of this standard and changes in other principles or interpretations could have a significant effect on our reported financial results and could affect the reporting of transactions completed before the announcement of a change in addition the sec is considering a multiyear plan that could ultimately lead to the use of international financial reporting standards by us issuers in their sec filings any such change could have a significant effect on our reported financial results 

in addition we may need to significantly change our customer contracts accounting systems and processes if we are required to adopt future or proposed changes in accounting principles noted above the cost and effect of these changes may negatively impact our results of operations during the periods of transition 

the irs and other tax authorities regularly examine our tax returns and the outcome of current and future tax examinations may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows 

the irs and other tax authorities regularly examine our income tax returns and other nonincome tax returns such as payroll sales use valueadded net worth or franchise property goods and services consumption import stamp and excise taxes in both the united states and foreign jurisdictions governments are increasingly focused on ways to increase tax revenues particularly from multinational corporations which may lead to an increase in audit activity and harsher stances taken by tax authorities the calculation of our provision for income taxes and our accruals for other taxes requires us to use significant judgment and involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes we regularly assess the potential settlement outcomes resulting from income tax examinations however the final outcome of tax examinations including the total amount payable or the timing of any such payments upon resolution of these issues cannot be estimated with certainty in addition we cannot be certain that such amount will not be materially different from the amount that is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals for other taxes should the irs or other tax authorities assess additional taxes penalties or interest as a result of a current or a future examination we may be required to record charges to operations in future periods that could have a material impact on our results of operations financial position or cash flows in the applicable period or periods 

our restructuring plans may not result in the benefits we have anticipated possibly having a negative effect on our future operating results 

in recent fiscal years we have initiated restructuring plans in an effort to reallocate or decrease costs by reducing our workforce and by consolidating facilities we incur substantial costs to implement restructuring plans and our restructuring activities may subject us to litigation risks and expenses in addition our restructuring plans may have other consequences such as attrition beyond our planned reduction in workforce a negative effect on employee morale or our ability to attract highly skilled employees our competitors may also use our restructuring plans to seek to gain a competitive advantage over us the restructuring plans could also cause our remaining employees to leave or result in reduced productivity by our employees and in turn this may affect our revenue and other operating results in the future 

failure to obtain export licenses could harm our business by rendering us unable to ship products and transfer our technology outside of the united states 

we must comply with regulations of the united states and of certain other countries in shipping our products and transferring our technology outside the united states and to foreign nationals any significant future difficulty in complying with these regulations could harm our business operating results or financial condition 

errors or defects in our products and services could expose us to liability and harm our business 

our customers use our products and services in designing and developing products that involve a high degree of technological complexity each of which has its own specifications because of the complexity of the systems and products with which we work some of our products and designs can be adequately tested only when put to full use in the marketplace as a result our customers or their end users may discover errors or defects in our software or the systems we design or the products or systems incorporating our design and intellectual property may not operate as expected errors or defects could result in 

 if we become subject to unfair hiring claims we could be prevented from hiring needed employees incur liability for damages and incur substantial costs in defending ourselves 

when companies in our industry lose employees to competitors they frequently claim that these competitors have engaged in unfair hiring practices or that the employment of these persons would involve the disclosure or use of trade secrets these claims could prevent us from hiring employees or cause us to incur liability for damages we could also incur substantial costs in defending ourselves or our employees against these claims regardless of their merits defending ourselves from these claims could also divert the attention of our management away from our operations 

antitakeover defenses in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and certain provisions under delaware law could prevent an acquisition of our company or limit the price that investors might be willing to pay for our common stock 

our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and certain provisions of the delaware general corporation law that apply to us could make it difficult for another company to acquire control of our company for example 

 all or any one of these factors could limit the price that certain investors would be willing to pay for shares of our common stock and could allow our board of directors to resist delay or prevent an acquisition of our company even if a proposed transaction were favored by a majority of our independent stockholders   

conflict minerals regulations may cause us to continue to incur additional expenses and may adversely impact our ability to conduct our business 

in august 2012 the sec adopted new rules establishing disclosure and reporting requirements regarding the use of certain minerals referred to as “conflict minerals” in products these rules require us to determine disclose and report whether or not such minerals in our products originate from the democratic republic of the congo or adjoining countries we have incurred and expect to continue to incur costs to comply with these rules including costs associated with conducting due diligence on our supply chain and fulfilling our reporting requirements and we may incur costs related to changes to our products processes or sources of supply in addition these rules could affect the availability of certain minerals used in the manufacture of our emulation hardware products and ip boards or the covered products and thus impact our ability to source at competitive prices certain materials that are used in the covered products finally our customers may prefer to purchase products from vendors who claim that all minerals in their products are conflictfree and our revenues may be harmed or we may face reputational challenges if we are unable to verify that our covered products are conflictfree 

our business is subject to the risk of earthquakes and other natural disasters 

our corporate headquarters including certain of our research and development operations and certain of our distribution facilities is located in the silicon valley area of northern california a region known to experience seismic activity if significant seismic activity were to occur our operations may be interrupted which could adversely impact our business and results of operations 

our other offices in the united states and in other countries around the world may be adversely impacted by natural disasters if a natural disaster occurs at or near any of our offices our operations may be interrupted which could adversely impact our business and results of operations if a natural disaster impacts a significant number of our customers our business and results of operations could be adversely impacted 

risks related to our securities and indebtedness 

warrant transactions associated with our 2015 notes will in certain circumstances dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders 

at the time of issuance of our 2015 notes we entered into separate warrant transactions or the 2015 warrants for the purchase of up to approximately 464 million shares of our common stock at a strike price of 1078 per share these warrants expire on various dates from september 2015 through december 2015 these warrants will be settled in net shares upon expiration of the warrants we will issue shares of our common stock to the purchasers of the warrants that represent the value by which the price of our common stock exceeds the strike price stipulated within the particular warrant agreement if our stock price is above the warrants’ strike price upon expiration of the warrants the warrants will dilute the ownership interest of our existing stockholders the warrants will also dilute our diluted earnings per share in periods when our average closing stock price exceeds the strike price of the particular warrant any sales in the public market of common stock issuable upon net settlement at expiration of the warrants could adversely affect then current market prices of our common stock 

our debt obligations expose us to risks that could adversely affect our business operating results or financial condition and could prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under such indebtedness 

we have a substantial level of debt as of january 3 2015  we had total outstanding indebtedness with a principal balance of approximately 7000 million  we also had the ability to borrow 2500 million  under our revolving credit facility with the right to request increased capacity up to an additional 1500 million  upon the receipt of lender commitments for total maximum borrowings of  4000 million  available under our revolving credit facility subject to the limits contained in the credit agreement governing our revolving credit facility the indentures that govern the 4375 senior notes due 2024 or the 2024 notes and the 2625  cash convertible senior notes due 2015 or the 2015 notes and our other debt instruments we may be able to incur substantial additional debt from time to time to finance working capital capital expenditures investments or acquisitions or for other purposes if we do so the risks related to our high level of debt could intensify specifically our high level of debt could have important consequences including the following 

 acquisitions or other general corporate requirements 

 purposes thereby reducing the amount of cash flows available for working capital capital expenditures 

acquisitions and other general corporate purposes 

 our revolving credit facility are at variable rates of interest 

 at the option of the holders of our outstanding notes we may under certain circumstances be required to repurchase such notes 

under the terms of our 2015 notes and 2024 notes we may be required to repurchase for cash such notes prior to their maturity in connection with the occurrence of certain significant corporate events in the case of the 2015 notes we are required to offer to repurchase such notes upon a “fundamental change” as defined in the indenture related to such notes such as a change of control in which substantially all of the consideration does not consist of publicly traded securities in the case of the 2024 notes we are required to offer to repurchase such notes upon a “change of control triggering event” as defined in the indenture related to such notes such as a change of control accompanied by certain downgrades in the credit ratings of such notes the repayment obligations under such notes may have the effect of discouraging delaying or preventing a takeover of our company if we were required to pay the 2024 notes prior to their scheduled maturity it could have a significant negative impact on our cash and liquidity and could impact our ability to invest financial resources in other strategic initiatives 

the terms of the credit agreement governing our revolving credit facility and the indentures governing our 2024 notes restrict our current and future operations particularly our ability to respond to changes or to take certain actions 

the credit agreement governing our revolving credit facility contains a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and may limit our ability to engage in acts that may be in our longterm best interest including restrictions on our ability to 

 20 

in addition the restrictive covenants in the credit agreement governing our revolving credit facility require us to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy other financial condition tests our ability to meet those financial ratios and tests can be affected by events beyond our control and we may be unable to meet them 

a breach of the covenants or restrictions under the credit agreement governing our revolving credit facility could result in an event of default under the applicable indebtedness such a default may allow the creditors to accelerate the related debt and may result in the acceleration of any other debt to which a crossacceleration or crossdefault provision applies in addition an event of default under the credit agreement governing our revolving credit facility would permit the lenders under our revolving credit facility to terminate all commitments to extend further credit under that facility in the event our lenders or note holders accelerate the repayment of our borrowings we and our subsidiaries may not have sufficient assets to repay that indebtedness as a result of these restrictions we may be 

 the indentures governing our 2024 notes also contain certain restrictive covenants that impose operating and financial restrictions on us and may limit our ability to engage in acts that may be in our longterm best interest including restrictions on our ability to incur liens and to enter into sale and leaseback transactions 

these restrictions may affect our ability to grow in accordance with our strategy in addition our financial results our substantial indebtedness and our credit ratings could adversely affect the availability and terms of our financing 

we may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness which may not be successful 

our ability to make scheduled payments on or refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial condition and operating performance which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial business legislative regulatory and other factors beyond our control we may be unable to maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal premium if any and interest on our indebtedness 

if our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations we could face substantial liquidity problems and could be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures or to dispose of material assets or operations seek additional debt or equity capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness we may not be able to effect any such alternative measures if necessary on commercially reasonable terms or at all and even if successful those alternative actions may not allow us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations the credit agreement governing our revolving credit facility restricts our ability to dispose of assets and use the proceeds from those dispositions and may also restrict our ability to raise debt or equity capital to be used to repay other indebtedness when it becomes due we may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain proceeds in an amount sufficient to meet any debt service obligations then due 

in addition we conduct a substantial portion of our operations through our subsidiaries none of which are currently guarantors of our indebtedness accordingly repayment of our indebtedness is dependent on the generation of cash flow by our subsidiaries and their ability to make such cash available to us by dividend debt repayment or otherwise unless they become guarantors of our indebtedness our subsidiaries do not have any obligation to pay amounts due on our indebtedness or to make funds available for that purpose our subsidiaries may not be able to or may not be permitted to make distributions to enable us to make payments in respect of our indebtedness each subsidiary is a distinct legal entity and under certain circumstances legal and contractual restrictions may limit our ability to obtain cash from our subsidiaries while the credit agreement governing our revolving credit facility limits the ability of our subsidiaries to incur consensual restrictions on their ability to pay dividends or make other intercompany payments to us these limitations are subject to qualifications and exceptions in the event that we do not receive distributions from our subsidiaries we may be unable to make required principal and interest payments on our indebtedness 

our inability to generate sufficient cash flows to satisfy our debt obligations or to refinance our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all would materially and adversely affect our financial position and results of operations and our ability to satisfy our debt obligations 

if we cannot make scheduled payments on our debt we will be in default and holders of our debt could declare all outstanding principal and interest to be due and payable the lenders under our revolving credit facility could terminate their commitments to loan money and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation in addition a material default on our indebtedness could suspend our eligibility to register securities using certain registration statement forms under sec guidelines that permit incorporation by reference of substantial information regarding us potentially hindering our ability to raise capital through the issuance of our securities and increasing our costs of registration 

hedge and warrant transactions entered into in connection with the issuance of the 2015 notes may affect the value of our common stock 

we entered into hedge transactions with various financial institutions at the time of the issuance of the 2015 notes or the 2015 notes hedges with the objective of limiting our exposure to the additional cash payments above the principal amount we may be required to pay upon conversion of the 2015 notes we also entered into separate warrant transactions with the same financial institutions in connection with these hedge and warrant transactions financial institutions purchased our common stock in secondary market transactions and entered into various overthecounter derivative transactions with respect to our common stock these entities or their affiliates are likely to unwind or modify their hedge positions prior to conversion or maturity of the 2015 notes in connection with the unwinding or modification of these hedge positions these entities or their affiliates may purchase or sell shares of our common stock other securities of ours or other financial instruments relating to such hedge positions any of these transactions and activities could adversely affect the value of our common stock and the amount of cash that the 2015 notes holders will receive upon conversion of the 2015 notes 

we are subject to the risk that the hedge participants fail to fulfill their obligations under the 2015 notes hedge transactions 

the 2015 notes hedges are intended to reduce our exposure to cash payments above the principal balance of the 2015 notes in the event of cash conversions if the participants in the hedge transactions are unwilling or unable to perform their obligations under those transactions for any reason we would not be able to receive the benefits of such transactions we cannot provide any assurances as to the financial stability or viability of any of the participants in the hedge transactions our 2015 notes were convertible as of january 3 2015  and mature in june 2015 if the hedge participants fail to meet their obligations for any reason it could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and financial condition 

despite our current level of indebtedness we and our subsidiaries may still be able to incur substantially more debt this could further exacerbate the risks to our financial condition described above 

we and our subsidiaries may be able to incur significant additional indebtedness in the future although the credit agreement governing our revolving credit facility contains restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions and the additional indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial if we incur any additional indebtedness that ranks equally with the 2024 notes and the 2015 notes then subject to any collateral arrangements we may enter into the holders of that debt will be entitled to share ratably in any proceeds distributed in connection with any insolvency liquidation reorganization dissolution or other winding up of our company 

our variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly 

borrowings under our revolving credit facility are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk if we were to borrow under our revolving credit facility and if interest rates were to increase our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness would increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same and our net income and cash flows including cash available for servicing our indebtedness would correspondingly decrease assuming all loans were fully drawn and that we were to fully exercise our right to increase borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility each quarter point change in interest rates would result in an approximately 10 million change in annual interest expense on our indebtedness under our revolving credit facility in the future we may enter into interest rate swaps that involve the exchange of floating for fixed rate interest payments in order to reduce interest rate volatility however we may not maintain interest rate swaps with respect to all of our variable rate indebtedness and any swaps we enter into may not fully mitigate our interest rate risk 

various factors could increase our future borrowing costs or reduce our access to capital including a lowering or withdrawal of the ratings assigned to our 2024 notes by rating agencies 

we may in the future seek additional financing for a variety of reasons and our future borrowing costs and access to capital could be affected by factors including the condition of the debt and equity markets the condition of the economy generally prevailing interest rates our level of indebtedness and our business and financial condition in addition the 2024 notes currently have an investment grade rating and any rating assigned could be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if in that rating agency’s judgment future circumstances relating to the basis of the rating such as adverse changes so warrant consequently real or anticipated changes in our credit ratings will generally affect the market value of the 2024 notes any future lowering of the ratings of the 2024 notes likely would make it more difficult or more expensive for us to obtain additional debt financing

 item 2 properties 

we own land and buildings at our headquarters located in san jose california we also own buildings in india as of january 3 2015  the total square footage of our owned buildings was approximately 965000  

we lease additional facilities in the united states and various other countries we sublease certain of these facilities where space is not fully utilized or has been impacted as part of our restructuring plans 

we believe that these facilities are adequate for our current needs and that suitable additional or substitute space will be available as needed to accommodate any expansion of our operations 




  item 3 legal proceedings 

from time to time we are involved in various disputes and litigation that arise in the ordinary course of business these include disputes and lawsuits related to intellectual property indemnification obligations mergers and acquisitions licensing contracts distribution arrangements and employee relations matters at least quarterly we review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure if the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount or the range of loss can be estimated we accrue a liability for the estimated loss legal proceedings are subject to uncertainties and the outcomes are difficult to predict because of such uncertainties accruals are based on our judgments using the best information available at the time as additional information becomes available we reassess the potential liability related to pending claims and litigation matters and may revise our estimates

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

  

the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k and with part i item 1a “risk factors” please refer to the cautionary language at the beginning of part i of this annual report on form 10k regarding forwardlooking statements 

business overview 

we continue to focus on executing our system design enablement or sde strategy to deliver the technologies necessary for integrated system and soc design with an end product in mind our growing core eda business is at the heart of our sde strategy and is complemented by our business in ip system interconnect and analysis system level design and hardwaresoftware development 

our business serves customers that are driven by enduser demand for electronics systems ics and devices that are smaller use less power and provide more functionality we offer innovative solutions to help our customers meet these demands 

our future performance depends on our ability to innovate commercialize newly developed solutions and enhance and maintain our current products we must keep pace with our customers’ technical developments satisfy industry standards and meet our customers’ increasingly demanding performance productivity quality and predictability requirements we expect to continue to invest in research and development and customer and partner relationships 

we have identified certain items that management uses as performance indicators to manage our business including revenue certain elements of operating expenses and cash flow from operations and we describe these items further below under the headings “results of operations” and “liquidity and capital resources” 

critical accounting estimates 

in preparing our consolidated financial statements we make assumptions judgments and estimates that can have a significant impact on our revenue operating income and net income as well as on the value of certain assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets we base our assumptions judgments and estimates on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions at least quarterly we evaluate our assumptions judgments and estimates and make changes as deemed necessary we believe that the assumptions judgments and estimates involved in the accounting for income taxes revenue recognition business combinations intangible asset and goodwill impairments and fair value of financial instruments have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements therefore we consider these to be our critical accounting estimates for information on our significant accounting policies see note 2 in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

accounting for income taxes 

we are subject to income taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our provision for these taxes there are many transactions that occur during the ordinary course of business for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain our provision for income taxes could be adversely affected by our earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries where we have higher statutory rates losses incurred in jurisdictions for which we are not able to realize the related tax benefit changes in foreign currency exchange rates entry into new businesses and geographies and changes to our existing businesses acquisitions including integrations and investments changes in our deferred tax assets and liabilities including changes in our assessment of valuation allowances changes in the relevant tax laws or interpretations of these tax laws and developments in current and future tax examinations 

we only recognize the tax benefit of an income tax position if we judge that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained solely on its technical merits in a tax audit including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes to make this judgment we must interpret complex and sometimes ambiguous tax laws regulations and administrative practices if we judge that an income tax position meets this recognition threshold then we must measure the amount of the tax benefit to be recognized by estimating the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50 cumulative probability of being realized upon effective settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all of the relevant facts it is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts as this requires us to determine the probability of various possible settlement outcomes we must reevaluate our income tax positions on a quarterly basis to consider factors such as changes in facts or circumstances changes in tax law effectively settled issues under audit the lapse of applicable statute of limitations and new audit activity such a change in recognition or measurement would result in recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision for a more detailed description of our unrecognized tax benefits see note 6 in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition 

we begin to recognize revenue when all of the following criteria are met 

 significant judgment is involved in the determination of whether the facts and circumstances of an arrangement support that the fee for the arrangement is considered to be fixed or determinable and that collectibility of the fee is probable and these judgments can affect the amount of revenue that we recognize in a particular reporting period for installment contracts that do not include a substantial upfront payment we consider a fee to be fixed or determinable only if the arrangement has payment periods that are less than or equal to the term of the licenses and the payments are collected in equal or nearly equal installments when evaluated over the entire term of the arrangement if we no longer were to have a history of collecting under the original contract without providing concessions on term licenses revenue from term licenses would be required to be recognized when payments under the installment contract become due and payable such a change could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

we must also make judgments when assessing whether a contract amendment to a term arrangement primarily in the context of a license extension or renewal constitutes a concession we have established a history of collecting under contracts for which the fee has been assessed as fixed or determinable without providing concessions on payments products or services 

generally we are able to estimate whether collection is probable but significant judgment is applied as we assess the creditworthiness of our customers to make this determination key external and internal factors are considered in developing our creditworthiness assessment including public information historical and current financial statements and past collection history if our experience were to change it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations if in our judgment collection of a fee is not probable we do not record revenue until the uncertainty is removed which is generally upon receipt of cash payment 

in general revenue associated with term and subscription licenses is recognized ratably over the term of the license commencing upon the later of the effective date of the arrangement or delivery of the first software product in general product revenue associated with perpetual licenses where vendor specific objective evidence or vsoe exists for the undelivered maintenance is recognized up front upon the later of the effective date of the arrangement or delivery of the software product provided all other conditions for revenue recognition have been met and maintenance revenue is recognized ratably over the maintenance term a relatively small percentage of our revenue from software licenses is recognized on an upfront basis 

our hardware products generally include the hardware product and its related essential software and maintenance for the hardware and the essential software consideration allocated to the hardware product and the essential software is recognized as revenue at the time of delivery provided all other conditions for revenue recognition have been met consideration allocated to the maintenance is recognized ratably over the maintenance term 

revenue from customized ip services is recognized either on the time and materials method as work is performed or on the percentageofcompletion method if a service contract is considered to be part of a multiple element arrangement or mea that includes a software contract revenue is generally recognized ratably over the duration of the software contract for contracts with fixed or nottoexceed fees we estimate on a monthly basis the percentage of completion based on the completion of milestones relating to the arrangement we have a history of accurately estimating project status and the costs necessary to complete projects a number of internal and external factors can affect our estimates including labor rates utilization and efficiency variances and specification and testing requirement changes if different conditions were to prevail such that accurate estimates could not be made then the use of the completed contract method would be required and the recognition of all revenue and costs would be deferred until the project was completed such a change could have a material impact on our results of operations 

if a group of contracts is so closely related that they are in effect part of a single arrangement such arrangements are deemed to be an mea we exercise significant judgment to evaluate the relevant facts and circumstances in determining whether the separate contracts should be accounted for individually as distinct arrangements or whether the separate contracts are in substance an mea our judgments about whether a group of contracts is an mea can affect the timing of revenue recognition under those contracts which could have an effect on our results of operations for the periods involved for example a perpetual license agreement that would otherwise result in upfront revenue upon delivery may be deemed part of an mea when it is executed within close proximity or in contemplation of other license agreements that require ratable revenue recognition with the same customer in which event all the revenue is recognized over the longest term of any component of the mea instead of up front 

for an mea that includes software and nonsoftware elements we allocate consideration to all software elements as a group and all nonsoftware elements based on their relative standalone selling prices revenue allocated to each deliverable is then recognized when all four criteria are met in these circumstances there is a hierarchy to determine the standalone selling price to be used for allocating consideration to the deliverables as follows 

 we calculate the besp of our hardware products based on our pricing practices including the historical average prices charged for comparable hardware products because vsoe or tpe cannot be established our process for determining besp for our software deliverables without vsoe or tpe takes into account multiple factors that vary depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each deliverable key external and internal factors considered in developing the besps include prices charged by us for similar arrangements historical pricing practices and the nature of the product in addition when developing besps we may consider other factors as appropriate including the pricing of competitive alternatives if they exist and productspecific business objectives we exercise significant judgment to evaluate the relevant facts and circumstances in calculating the besp of the deliverables in our arrangements 

business combinations 

when we acquire businesses we allocate the purchase price to the acquired tangible assets and assumed liabilities including deferred revenue liabilities associated with the fair value of contingent consideration and acquired identifiable intangible assets any residual purchase price is recorded as goodwill the allocation of the purchase price requires us to make significant estimates in determining the fair values of these acquired assets and assumed liabilities especially with respect to intangible assets and goodwill these estimates are based on information obtained from management of the acquired companies our assessment of this information and historical experience these estimates can include but are not limited to the cash flows that an acquired business is expected to generate in the future the cash flows that specific assets acquired with that business are expected to generate in the future the appropriate weightedaverage cost of capital and the cost savings expected to be derived from acquiring an asset these estimates are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and if different estimates were used the purchase price for the acquisition could be allocated to the acquired assets and assumed liabilities differently from the allocation that we have made to the acquired assets and assumed liabilities in addition unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that may affect the accuracy or validity of such estimates and if such events occur we may be required to adjust the value allocated to acquired assets or assumed liabilities 

we also make significant judgments and estimates when we assign useful lives to the definitelived intangible assets identified as part of our acquisitions these estimates are inherently uncertain and if we used different estimates the useful life over which we amortize intangible assets would be different in addition unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that may impact the useful life assigned to our intangible assets which would impact our amortization of intangible assets expense and our results of operations 

fair value of financial instruments 

on a quarterly basis we measure at fair value certain financial assets and liabilities inputs to valuation techniques are observable or unobservable observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources while unobservable inputs reflect our market assumptions 

while we believe the observable and unobservable inputs we use to measure the fair value are reasonable different inputs or estimates may materially impact the resulting fair value measurements of these instruments and may also impact our results of operations for an additional description of our fair value measurements see note 8 in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

results of operations 

financial results for fiscal 2014  as compared to fiscal 2013  and 2012  reflect the following 

 our fiscal year ends on the saturday closest to december 31 fiscal 2014 was a 53week year compared to fiscal 2013 and 2012 which were 52week years as noted above revenue and expenses included in the results of operations for fiscal 2014 were impacted by the additional week 

revenue 

we primarily generate revenue from licensing our software and ip selling or leasing our emulation hardware technology providing maintenance for our software emulation hardware and ip providing engineering services and earning royalties generated from the use of our ip the timing of our revenue is significantly affected by the mix of software emulation hardware and ip products in the bookings executed in any given period and whether the revenue for such bookings is recognized in a recurring manner over multiple periods or up front upon completion of delivery 

 we seek to achieve a consistent revenue mix such that approximately 90 of our revenue is recurring in nature and the remainder of the resulting revenue is recognized up front upon completion of delivery recurring revenue includes revenue from our license arrangements where revenue is recognized over multiple periods services royalties from certain ip arrangements maintenance on perpetual software licenses and emulation hardware and our operating leases of emulation hardware upfront revenue is primarily generated by our sales of emulation hardware and perpetual software licenses our ability to achieve this mix in any single fiscal period may be impacted primarily by hardware sales for an additional description of our current product strategy see the discussion under the heading “products and product strategy” under part i item 1 “business” 

approximately 90 of the aggregate value of our revenue during fiscal 2014  2013  and 2012  was of a type for which the revenue is recurring in nature 

 we believe our reported revenue and the amount of revenue recognized in future periods will depend on among other things the 

 31 

revenue by year 

the following table shows our revenue for fiscal 2014  2013  and 2012  and the change in revenue between years 



product and maintenance revenue increased during fiscal 2014  as compared to fiscal 2013  and during fiscal 2013  as compared to fiscal 2012  primarily because of increased business levels incremental revenue recognized from our acquisitions and an additional week of operations in fiscal 2014 the additional week of operations contributed approximately 150 million of revenue to fiscal 2014 

services revenue remained relatively constant during fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 but decreased during fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 primarily because of the redeployment of certain of our design services engineers to internal research and development projects related to our design ip activities services revenue may fluctuate from period to period based on demand for and our resources to fulfill our services and customized ip offerings 

no one customer accounted for 10  or more of total revenue during fiscal 2014  2013  or 2012  

revenue by product group 

the following table shows the percentage of product and related maintenance revenue contributed by each of our five product groups and services during fiscal 2014  2013  and 2012  



as described in note 2 in the notes to consolidated financial statements certain of our licensing arrangements allow customers the ability to remix among software products additionally we have arrangements with customers that include a combination of our products with the actual product selection and number of licensed users to be determined at a later date for these arrangements we estimate the allocation of the revenue to product groups based upon the expected usage of our products the actual usage of our products by these customers may differ and if that proves to be the case the revenue allocation in the table above would differ 

revenue by geography 



most of our revenue is transacted in the united states dollar however certain revenue transactions are denominated in foreign currencies primarily the japanese yen we recognize reduced revenue from those contracts in periods when the japanese yen weakens in value against the united states dollar and additional revenue from those contracts in periods when the japanese yen strengthens against the united states dollar for an additional description of how changes in foreign exchange rates affect our consolidated financial statements see the discussion in item 7a “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk – foreign currency risk” 

revenue for asia increased during fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2012 primarily due to increases in revenue from our software business and emulation hardware installations for the primary factors contributing to our increase in revenue in other geographies excluding japan see the general description under “revenue by year” above 

revenue for japan decreased by approximately 20 million during fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 and during fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 primarily due to the continued depreciation of the japanese yen as well as difficult business conditions facing our japanese customers 

revenue by geography as a percent of total revenue 



cost of revenue 

  

the following table shows cost of revenue as a percentage of related revenue for fiscal 2014  2013  and 2012  

  



cost of product and maintenance 

cost of product and maintenance includes costs associated with the sale and lease of our emulation hardware and licensing of our software and ip products certain employee salary benefits and other employeerelated costs cost of our customer support services amortization of technologyrelated and maintenancerelated acquired intangibles as well as the costs of technical documentation and royalties payable to thirdparty vendors costs associated with our emulation hardware products include materials assembly applicable reserves and overhead these additional hardware manufacturing costs make our cost of emulation hardware product higher as a percentage of revenue than our cost of software and ip products 

a summary of cost of product and maintenance for fiscal 2014  2013  and 2012  is as follows 

  

  

cost of product and maintenance depends primarily upon our emulation hardware product sales and gross margins in any given period employee salary benefits and other employeerelated costs and the timing and extent to which we acquire intangible assets acquire or license thirdparties’ intellectual property or technology and sell our products that include such acquired or licensed intellectual property or technology also impact cost of product and maintenance 

the changes in product and maintenancerelated costs were due to the following 



emulation hardware costs increased during fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 primarily as a result of incremental reserves on inventory and increased overhead emulation hardware costs increased during fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 primarily due to a higher volume of emulation hardware products sold gross margins on our emulation hardware products may fluctuate based on our pricing strategies product competition and product life cycle gross margins on our emulation hardware products decreased during fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 and during fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 

salary benefits and other employeerelated costs increased during fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 primarily due to an increase in compensation including variable compensation for existing employees salary benefits and other employeerelated costs decreased during fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 primarily due to redeployment of certain customer support employees to sales support roles 

amortization of acquired intangibles included in cost of product and maintenance increased during fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 and during fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 primarily due to the increase in amortization of intangible assets associated with our fiscal 2014 and 2013 acquisitions we expect amortization of acquired intangibles to increase for fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 primarily due to amortization of intangible assets recorded in connection with our fiscal 2014 acquisitions for an additional description of our expected amortization of intangible assets see note 5 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

cost of services 

cost of services primarily includes employee salary benefits and other employeerelated costs to perform work on revenuegenerating projects costs to maintain the infrastructure necessary to manage a services organization and provisions for contract losses if any cost of services will fluctuate from period to period based on our utilization of design services engineers on revenuegenerating projects or on internal development projects 

the decrease of 46 million  in cost of services during fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 was primarily due to an overall decrease in services revenue lower variable compensation and a decrease in the use of thirdparty contractors 

operating expenses 

our operating expenses include marketing and sales research and development and general and administrative expenses factors that cause our operating expenses to fluctuate include changes in the number of employees due to hiring and acquisitions foreign exchange rates stockbased compensation and the impact of our variable compensation programs that are driven by overall operating results 

our employee salary and other compensationrelated costs included in marketing and sales and research and development increased during fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 and during fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 primarily due to our iprelated research and development activities sales activities and incremental costs related to employees added from our fiscal 2014 and 2013 acquisitions our employee salary and other compensationrelated costs included in general and administrative decreased during fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 primarily due to a decrease in acquisitionrelated compensation costs employee salary and other compensationrelated costs included in general and administrative increased during fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 primarily due to incremental costs related to employees added from our fiscal 2013 and 2012 acquisitions 

stockbased compensation included in operating expenses increased 175 million  during fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 and 187 million  during fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 primarily because of higher grantdate fair values of stock awards 

during fiscal 2014 we initiated a voluntary early retirement program the program was offered to certain eligible employees in north america and japan we recorded costs associated with this program of approximately 97 million  in our operating expenses during fiscal 2014 

we expect our operating expenses to generally increase during fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 primarily due to expected hiring of additional employees during fiscal 2015 and because fiscal 2015 will include a full year of operating expenses for additional research and development and sales personnel added during fiscal 2014 through hiring and our fiscal 2014 acquisitions we also expect stockbased compensation included in operating expenses to increase during fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 due to amortization during fiscal 2015 of unrecognized expense related to unvested awards that generally have higher grantdate fair values compared to awards vested in previous years and amortization of new awards granted during fiscal 2015 

many of our operating expenses are transacted in various foreign currencies we recognize lower expenses in periods when the united states dollar strengthens in value against other currencies and we recognize higher expenses when the united states dollar weakens against other currencies for an additional description of how changes in foreign exchange rates affect our consolidated financial statements see the discussion in item 7a “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk – foreign currency risk” 

our operating expenses for fiscal 2014  2013  and 2012  were as follows 



our operating expenses as a percentage of total revenue for fiscal 2014  2013  and 2012  were as follows 



  

marketing and sales 

the changes in marketing and sales expense were due to the following 



research and development 

  the changes in research and development expense were due to the following 



general and administrative 

the changes in general and administrative expense were due to the following 



amortization of acquired intangibles 



the changes in amortization of acquired intangibles were due to the following 



restructuring and other charges 

we have initiated various restructuring plans to better align our resources with our business strategy including a restructuring plan we initiated during fiscal 2014 or the 2014 restructuring plan and a restructuring plan we initiated during fiscal 2013 or the 2013 restructuring plan for an additional description of the 2014 restructuring plan and 2013 restructuring plan see note 13 in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

because the restructuring charges and related benefits are derived from management’s estimates made during the formulation of the restructuring plans based on thencurrently available information our restructuring plans may not achieve the benefits anticipated on the timetable or at the level contemplated demand for our products and services and ultimately our future financial performance is difficult to predict with any degree of certainty accordingly additional actions including further restructuring of our operations may be required in the future 

the following table presents restructuring and other charges credits net for our restructuring plans 



restructuring and other charges recorded during fiscal 2014 consisted primarily of costs for severance and termination benefits and impairment of certain property plant and equipment related to the 2014 restructuring plan restructuring and other charges recorded during fiscal 2013 consisted primarily of costs for severance and termination benefits related to the 2013 restructuring plan restructuring and other charges recorded during fiscal 2012 consisted primarily of adjustments to previous estimates of restructuring liabilities 

interest expense 



we expect interest expense to increase during fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 due to interest expense on our 2024 notes partially offset by our repayment of the 2015 notes during fiscal 2015 

income taxes 

the following table presents the provision benefit for income taxes and the effective tax rate for fiscal 2014  2013  and 2012  



our provision for income taxes for the fiscal year ended january 3 2015  primarily resulted from federal state and foreign income taxes on our fiscal 2014 income our foreign earnings are generally subject to lower statutory tax rates than our united states earnings our provision for income taxes included the tax benefit of 81 million  resulting from the enactment of the united states research tax credit in december 2014 

our benefit for income taxes for the fiscal year ended december 28 2013  primarily consisted of the following 

 which were partially offset by 

 38 

our benefit for income taxes for fiscal 2012 primarily consisted of the following 

 which were partially offset by 

 our future effective tax rates may be materially impacted by tax amounts associated with our foreign earnings at rates different from the united states federal statutory rate research credits the tax impact of stockbased compensation accounting for uncertain tax positions business combinations closure of statute of limitations or settlement of tax audits changes in valuation allowance and changes in tax law a significant amount of our foreign earnings is generated by our subsidiaries organized in ireland and hungary our future effective tax rates may be adversely affected if our earnings were to be lower in countries where we have lower statutory tax rates or if we were to repatriate certain foreign earnings on which united states taxes have not been previously accrued 

the law that authorized the united states federal research tax credit expired on december 31 2014 unless a new law reinstates the federal research tax credit we will not include the potential benefit of the federal research tax credit in our tax provision calculations for fiscal 2015 we currently expect that our fiscal 2015 effective tax rate will be higher than our fiscal 2014 effective tax rate 

for further discussion regarding our income taxes see note 6 in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

 liquidity and capital resources 



cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments 

as of january 3 2015  our principal sources of liquidity consisted of 10226 million  of cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments as compared to 6330 million  as of december 28 2013  

our primary sources of cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments during fiscal 2014  were customer payments for our products and services proceeds from the issuance of our 4375  senior notes due october 15 2024 or the 2024 notes borrowings under our revolving credit facility and proceeds from the exercise of stock options and proceeds from stock purchases under our employee stock purchase plan 

our primary uses of cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments during fiscal 2014  were payments relating to salaries benefits other employeerelated costs and operating expenses our fiscal 2014 acquisitions payments on our revolving credit facility repurchases of our common stock purchases of inventory purchases of property plant and equipment tax payments and payments related to our recent restructuring plans and voluntary early retirement program 

approximately 45  of our cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments were held by our foreign subsidiaries as of january 3 2015  after the repayment of the 2015 notes during fiscal 2015 the proportion of our cash and cash equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries will increase our intent is to permanently reinvest our earnings from certain foreign operations we do not anticipate we will need to repatriate dividends from foreign operations that are permanently reinvested in order to fund our domestic operations in the event that dividends from foreign operations that are currently permanently reinvested are needed to fund united states liquidity we could be required to accrue and pay additional taxes in order to repatriate these funds for further discussion regarding our income taxes see note 6 in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

we maintain an investment portfolio of approximately 100 million in marketable debt securities including corporate debt securities united states treasury securities united states government agency securities bank certificates of deposit and commercial paper our investments in marketable debt securities are classified as availableforsale and are included in shortterm investments as of january 3 2015  our investments are made in accordance with our cash investment policy which governs the amounts and types of investments we hold in our portfolio our investment portfolio could be affected by various risks and uncertainties including credit risk interest rate risk and general market risk as outlined in part i item 1a “risk factors” 

we expect that current cash cash equivalents and shortterm investment balances cash flows that are generated from operations proceeds from our 2024 notes and cash borrowings available under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to meet our domestic and international working capital needs and other capital and liquidity requirements including servicing the maturity or conversion of our 2015 notes acquisitions if any and share repurchases for at least the next 12 months 

net working capital 

net working capital is comprised of current assets less current liabilities as shown on our consolidated balance sheets the increase in our net working capital as of january 3 2015  as compared to december 28 2013  is primarily due to higher cash balances resulting from the issuance of our 2024 notes 

cash flows from operating activities 

cash flows from operating activities during fiscal 2014  2013  and 2012  were as follows 



cash flows from operating activities include net income adjusted for certain noncash items as well as changes in the balances of certain assets and liabilities our cash flows from operating activities are significantly influenced by business levels and the payment terms set forth in our license agreements 

the decrease in cash flows from operating activities during fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 was primarily due to the timing of cash receipts from customers working capital requirements payments under our recent restructuring plans payments for our voluntary early retirement program and an increase in cash paid for taxes net of tax refunds the increase in cash flows from operating activities during fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 was primarily due to the timing of collections from customers and disbursements made to vendors 

if our customers experience adverse changes in the future are not successful in generating sufficient cash or are precluded from securing financing they may delay purchasing our products and services or they may not be able to pay or may delay payment of accounts receivable that are owed to us although these obligations are generally not cancelable our customers’ inability to fulfill payment obligations would adversely affect our cash flow additionally our customers may seek to renegotiate preexisting contractual commitments though we have not experienced a material level of defaults any material payment default by our customers or significant reductions in existing contractual commitments would have an adverse effect on our financial condition and cash flows from operations 

we expect that cash flows from operating activities will fluctuate in future periods due to a number of factors including our operating results tax payments and the timing of our billings collections and disbursements 

cash flows from investing activities 

cash flows from investing activities during fiscal 2014  2013  and 2012  were as follows 



the decrease in cash flows used for investing activities during fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 was primarily due to the decrease in cash paid for business combinations the increase in cash flows used for investing activities during fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 was primarily due to an increase in cash paid for business combinations offset by an increase in proceeds from the sale and maturity of availableforsale securities 

we expect to continue our investing activities including purchasing property plant and equipment purchasing intangible assets business combinations purchasing software licenses and making longterm equity investments 

cash flows from financing activities 

cash flows from financing activities during fiscal 2014  2013  and 2012  were as follows 



the increase in cash flows provided by financing activities during fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 was primarily due to proceeds from the issuance of our 2024 notes partially offset by payments made for the repurchase of our common stock the decrease in cash flows provided by financing activities during fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 was primarily due to payments made to retire the remaining principal balance of the 2013 notes and the 2023 notes 

we expect to continue to repurchase our common stock during fiscal 2015 for an additional description of our share repurchase programs and repurchase authorizations see part ii item 5 “market for registrant’s common equity related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities” and note 12 in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

other factors affecting liquidity and capital resources 

2024 notes 

on october 9 2014 we issued 3500 million aggregate principal amount of 4375 senior notes due october 15 2024 we received net proceeds of 3424 million from issuance of the 2024 notes net of a discount of 14 million and issuance costs of 62 million interest is payable in cash semiannually commencing on april 15 2015 the 2024 notes are unsecured and rank equal in right of payment to all of our existing and future senior indebtednessthe proceeds from the 2024 notes are available for general corporate purposes which may include the retirement of debt working capital capital expenditures acquisitions and strategic transactions 

revolving credit facility 

on september 19 2014 we amended our senior revolving credit facility on terms substantially similar to the prior credit agreement except that as amended our revolving credit facility i is unsecured ii expires on september 19 2019 iii has no subsidiary guarantors and iv includes certain amendments to the negative and financial covenants such as modifications to provide additional flexibility a reduction in cadence’s basket for secured debt and a decrease in the maximum permitted funded debt to ebidta ratio from 31 to 2751 subject to certain adjustments our revolving credit facility provides for borrowings up to 2500 million with the right to request increased capacity up to an additional 1500 million upon the receipt of lender commitments for total maximum borrowings of 4000 million 

convertible notes 

as of january 3 2015  we had convertible notes outstanding with a net liability value of 3425 million  that mature on june 1 2015 the total cash payable upon the early conversion of these notes as determined by the indenture of each security will be their principal amount plus any additional conversion value that would be due upon conversion 

we will owe additional cash to the note holders upon early conversion if our stock price exceeds 755 per share we entered into hedges with counterparties to limit our exposure to the additional cash payments above the principal amount of the 2015 notes that may be due to the holders upon conversion in separate transactions we sold the 2015 warrants with a strike price of 1078  per share although our incremental cash payout exposure above the conversion price is limited by the 2015 notes hedges to the outstanding principal value of the 2015 notes and accrued interest we will experience dilution to our stock upon settlement of the 2015 warrants and to our diluted earnings per share from the outstanding 2015 warrants to the extent our average closing stock price exceeds 1078  in any fiscal quarter until the 2015 warrants are settled 

additionally holders may elect to convert their 2015 notes into cash at any time through the second trading day immediately preceding the maturity date if the holders of our 2015 notes elect to convert their notes into cash prior to maturity we are required to pay the note holders cash equal to the principal amount of the notes converted plus any additional conversion value associated with the conversion feature we will receive cash from the counterparties to the 2015 notes hedges for the value of the conversion feature upon settlement of the notes tendered as of january 3 2015  a total of 479 million  of the 2015 notes had been tendered for early conversion of which one thousand  dollars principal value had been settled subsequent to january 3 2015 we received notifications for early conversion of an additional 60 million  principal value of the 2015 notes resulting in an aggregate amount of 539 million  principal value of the 2015 notes having been tendered for conversion as of february 19 2015  

we expect that cash generated from our operating activities proceeds from our 2024 notes and access to our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to service the maturity or conversion of our 2015 notes for an additional description of the 2015 notes the conversion terms thereof and the hedge and warrants transactions see note 3 in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

contractual obligations 

a summary of our contractual obligations as of january 3 2015  is as follows 



 

 in connection with our acquisitions completed before january 3 2015  we are obligated to pay up to an aggregate of 100 million  in cash over the next 15  months if certain defined performance goals are achieved in full 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

as of january 3 2015  we did not have any significant offbalance sheet arrangements as defined in item 303a4ii of sec regulation sk 

new accounting standards 

on may 28 2014 the financial accounting standards board issued a comprehensive revenue recognition standard that will supersede nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under united states generally accepted accounting principles the updated standard will become effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 and permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method early adoption is not permitted we are currently evaluating the effect that the updated standard will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures 

we periodically review new accounting standards although some of the accounting standards that have been issued may be applicable to us we have not identified any other new accounting standards that would have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

foreign currency risk 

a material portion of our revenue expenses and business activities are transacted in the united states dollar however certain of our operations include transactions in foreign currencies that can affect our results of operations in certain countries where we invoice customers in the local currency japan in particular our revenues benefit from a weaker dollar and are adversely affected by a stronger dollar the opposite impact occurs in countries where we record expenses in local currencies in those cases our costs and expenses benefit from a stronger dollar and are adversely affected by a weaker dollar the fluctuations in our operating expenses outside the united states resulting from volatility in the united states dollar against certain foreign currencies are not generally moderated by corresponding fluctuations in our revenues except for our operations in japan because we receive some cash payments and make most expense payments in japanese yen 

we enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts with financial institutions to protect against currency exchange risks associated with existing assets and liabilities a foreign currency forward exchange contract acts as a hedge by increasing in value when underlying assets decrease in value or underlying liabilities increase in value due to changes in foreign exchange rates conversely a foreign currency forward exchange contract decreases in value when underlying assets increase in value or underlying liabilities decrease in value due to changes in foreign exchange rates these forward contracts are not designated as accounting hedges so the unrealized gains and losses are recognized in other income net in advance of the actual foreign currency cash flows with the fair value of these forward contracts being recorded as accrued liabilities or other current assets 

we do not use forward contracts for trading purposes our forward contracts generally have maturities of 90 days or less we enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts based on estimated future asset and liability exposures and the effectiveness of our hedging program depends on our ability to estimate these future asset and liability exposures recognized gains and losses with respect to our current hedging activities will ultimately depend on how accurately we are able to match the amount of foreign currency forward exchange contracts with actual underlying asset and liability exposures 

the following table provides information about our foreign currency forward exchange contracts as of january 3 2015  the information is provided in united states dollar equivalent amounts the table presents the notional amounts at contract exchange rates and the weighted average contractual foreign currency exchange rates expressed as units of the foreign currency per united states dollar which in some cases may not be the market convention for quoting a particular currency all of these forward contracts mature before or during february 2015  



while we actively monitor our foreign currency risks there can be no assurance that our foreign currency hedging activities will substantially offset the impact of fluctuations in currency exchange rates on our results of operations cash flows and financial position 

interest rate risk 

our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our portfolio of marketable debt securities our portfolio of cash and cash equivalents and outstanding balances drawn on our revolving credit facility if any 

we are exposed to interest rate fluctuations in many of the world’s leading industrialized countries but the fair value of our marketable debt securities and our interest income and expense is most sensitive to fluctuations in the general level of united states interest rates in this regard changes in united states interest rates affect the interest earned on our marketable debt securities and cash and cash equivalents any unrealized and realized gains or losses on our marketable debt securities and the costs associated with foreign currency hedges pursuant to our investment policy we limit the amount of our credit exposure to any one issuer other than in securities issued by the united states treasury and united states government agencies 

our shortterm investments as of january 3 2015  include 886 million  of marketable debt securities that may decline in value if market interest rates rise such variability in market interest rates may result in a negative impact on the results of our investment activities as of january 3 2015  an increase in the market rates of interest of 1 would result in a decrease in the fair values of our marketable debt securities by approximately 07 million  

all highly liquid securities with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase are considered to be cash equivalents securities with maturities greater than three months are classified as availableforsale and are considered to be shortterm investments the carrying value of our interestbearing instruments approximated fair value as of january 3 2015  

interest rates under our revolving credit facility are variable so interest expense for periods when the credit facility is utilized could be adversely affected by changes in interest rates interest rates under our revolving credit facility can fluctuate based on changes in market interest rates and in an interest rate margin that varies based on our consolidated leverage ratio as of january 3 2015  we had no  outstanding balance under our revolving credit facility for additional description of this revolving credit facility see note 3 in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

equity price risk 

convertible notes 

our 2015 notes include conversion and settlement provisions that are based on the price of our common stock during a period following conversion of the notes in addition the hedges and warrants associated with these convertible notes also include settlement provisions that are based on the price of our common stock the amount of cash we may be required to pay at the time converted notes are settled is determined by the price of our common stock the amount of cash that we may receive from hedge counterparties in connection with the related hedges and the number of shares that we may be required to provide warrant counterparties in connection with the related warrants are also determined by the price of our common stock 

upon the expiration of our 2015 warrants which will occur on various dates from september 2015 through december 2015  cadence will issue shares of common stock to the purchasers of the warrants to the extent our stock price exceeds the warrant strike price of 1078  at that time the following table shows the number of shares that cadence would issue to 2015 warrant counterparties at expiration of the warrants assuming various cadence closing stock prices on the dates of warrant expiration 

  

prior to the expiration of the 2015 warrants for purposes of calculating diluted earnings per share our diluted weightedaverage shares outstanding will increase when our average closing stock price for a quarter exceeds 1078  

for an additional description of our 2015 notes see note 3 in the notes to consolidated financial statements and “liquidity and capital resources – other factors affecting liquidity and capital resources” under item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” 

equity investments 

we have a portfolio of equity investments that includes marketable equity securities and nonmarketable investments our equity investments are made primarily in connection with our strategic investment program under our strategic investment program from time to time we make cash investments in companies with technologies that are potentially strategically important to us see note 9 in the notes to consolidated financial statements for an additional description of these investments our nonmarketable investments had a carrying value of 61 million  as of january 3 2015  and 67 million  as of december 28 2013  




 item 9 changes in and disagreements with accountants on accounting and financial disclosure 

none 




 item 9a controls and procedures 

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

as required by rule 13a15 of the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended or the exchange act under the supervision and with the participation of our management including our chief executive officer or ceo and our chief financial officer or cfo we evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rules 13a15e and 15d15e under the exchange act as of january 3 2015  

the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures included a review of our processes and the effect on the information generated for use in this annual report on form 10k in the course of this evaluation we sought to identify any material weaknesses in our disclosure controls and procedures to determine whether we had identified any acts of fraud involving personnel who have a significant role in our disclosure controls and procedures and to confirm that any necessary corrective action including process improvements was taken this type of evaluation is done every fiscal quarter so that our conclusions concerning the effectiveness of these controls can be reported in our periodic reports filed with the sec the overall goals of these evaluation activities are to monitor our disclosure controls and procedures and to make modifications as necessary we intend to maintain these disclosure controls and procedures modifying them as circumstances warrant 

based on their evaluation as of january 3 2015  our ceo and cfo have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by us in our reports filed or submitted under the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the sec’s rules and forms and is accumulated and communicated to our management including the ceo and cfo as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure 

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the fiscal quarter ended january 3 2015  that materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting 

inherent limitations on effectiveness of controls 

our management including our ceo and cfo does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud internal control over financial reporting no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of internal control are met further the design of internal control must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of the control must be considered relative to their costs while our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance of their effectiveness because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within cadence have been detected 

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rule 13a15f under the exchange act our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of january 3 2015  in making this assessment our management used the criteria established in internal controlintegrated framework 1992 issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission or coso our management has concluded that as of january 3 2015  our internal control over financial reporting is effective based on these criteria our independent registered public accounting firm kpmg llp has issued an attestation report on our internal control over financial reporting which is included in part iv item 15 “exhibits and financial statement schedules” in may 2013 coso issued its internal control  integrated framework 2013  2013 coso framework and we have initiated the process to transition to the 2013 coso framework for fiscal 2015

the eda and ip industries and our business 

the eda and ip industries are driven by our customers response to enduser demand for electronic devices that are smaller use less power and provide more functionality to meet this demand our customers design and develop new ics and electronic devices and systems using our products and services accordingly our business depends on our customers continued investment in new designs and products 

the markets our customers serve are sensitive to product price performance and the time it takes to bring the products to market in order to be competitive and profitable in these markets our customers demand high levels of productivity from their design teams better predictability in shorter development schedules high performance products and lower development and manufacturing costs semiconductor and electronics systems companies are responding to these challenges and users demand for increased functionality and smaller devices by combining subsystems  such as radio frequency or rf wireless communication signal processing microprocessors and memory controllers  onto a single silicon chip creating a systemonchip or soc or combining multiple chips into a single chip package in a format referred to as systeminpackage or sip the trend toward subsystem integration has required these chip makers to find solutions to challenges previously addressed by system companies such as verifying systemlevel functionality and hardwaresoftware interoperability and has driven the need for incorporation of preverified commercial ip into these systems 

our strategy is to provide our customers with the ability to address the broad range of issues that arise at the silicon soc and system levels our offerings address many of the challenges associated with developing unique silicon circuitry integrating that circuitry with design ip developed by us or third parties to create socs designing the packaging and boardlevel interconnect which links ics and socs and combining the resulting hardware with software to create electronic systems 

significant issues that our customers face in creating their products include reducing power consumption manufacturing microscopic circuitry verifying device functionality and achieving technical performance targets all while meeting aggressive timetomarket and cost requirements providers of eda and ip solutions must deliver products that address these technical challenges while improving the productivity predictability reliability and profitability of the design processes and products of their customers 

products and product strategy 

our products are engineered to improve our customers design productivity and design quality by providing a comprehensive set of eda solutions emulation hardware and a differentiated portfolio of design ip and vip product and maintenance revenue includes fees from licenses to use our software and ip from sales and leases of our hardware products and from royalties generated by our customers shipment of their products containing certain types of our ip see product arrangements below for a discussion of our license types

for an additional description of our product and maintenance and services revenue see the discussion under results of operations under part ii item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

marketing and sales 

we generally market our products and provide services to existing and prospective customers through a direct sales force consisting of sales people and applications engineers applications engineers provide technical presales and postsales support for our products due to the complexity of many of our eda products and the electronic design process the sales cycle is generally long requiring three to six months or more during the sales cycle our direct sales force generally provides technical presentations product demonstrations and support for onsite customer evaluation of our solutions we also promote our products and services through advertising direct mail trade shows public relations and the internet we selectively utilize valueadded resellers to broaden our reach and reduce cost of sales all orcad and selected incisive products are primarily marketed through these channels with respect to international sales we generally market and support our products and services through our subsidiaries we also use a thirdparty distributor to sell our products and services to certain customers in japan 

product arrangements 

we license software and ip using three license types term subscription and perpetual customers who prefer to license technology for a specified limited period of time will choose either a term or subscription license and customers who prefer to have the right to use the technology continuously without time restriction will choose a perpetual license customers who desire to use new software technology during the life of the contract will select a subscription license which allows them limited access to unspecified new technology on a whenandifavailable basis as opposed to a term or perpetual license which does not include the right to use new technology payment terms for term and subscription licenses generally provide for payments to be made in installments over the license period and payment terms for perpetual licenses generally are net 30 days 

our emulation hardware products are either sold or leased to our customers 

we generally license our design ip under nonexclusive license agreements that provide usage rights for specific designs in addition for certain of our ip license agreements we collect royalties as our customers ship their product that includes our ip to their customers 

for a further description of our license agreements our emulation hardware sale or lease agreements revenue recognition policies and results of operations please refer to the discussion under critical accounting estimates under part ii item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

backlog 

our backlog was approximately  19 billion  and 17 billion  as of december 28 2013  and december 29 2012  respectively our backlog as of december 28 2013  consisted of fully executed arrangements with effective dates commencing no later than december 28 2013  with revenue to be recognized thereafter and included a variety of types generally including but not limited to 

 5 

the substantial majority of our backlog consists of customer contracts for which product and maintenance revenue is recognized ratably or on a recurring basis over the contract life historically we have not experienced significant cancellations of our contracts with customers for engineering services contracts in backlog completion dates are occasionally rescheduled delaying revenue recognition under those contracts beyond the original anticipated completion date changes in customer license types or payment terms also can affect the timing of revenue recognition during fiscal 2013 approximately 70  of our revenue came from backlog as of december 29 2012  we expect approximately 11 billion  or approximately 70  of our fiscal 2014 revenue to come from arrangements that were in backlog as of december 28 2013  the actual percentage of revenue coming from backlog during fiscal 2014 may change if our actual business levels in fiscal 2014 are different than our current expectations 

research and development 

our research and development expense was 5340 million  during fiscal 2013 4541 million  during fiscal 2012 and 4007 million  during fiscal 2011 

the primary areas of our research and development include the following 

 our future performance depends largely on our ability to maintain and enhance our current product development and commercialization of newly developed products or capabilities and to offer solutions that meet increasingly demanding productivity quality predictability and cost requirements our offerings must keep pace with our customers technical developments including the adoption of advanced process nodes and industry standards we also dedicate significant research and development efforts to support our existing products 

manufacturing and software distribution 

we perform final assembly and testing of our emulation hardware products at our headquarters in san jose california subcontractors manufacture all major subassemblies including all individual pcbs and custom ics and supply them for qualification and testing before their incorporation into the assembled product 

software and documentation are primarily distributed to customers by secure electronic delivery or on dvd 

proprietary technology 

our success depends in part upon our proprietary technology we generally rely on patents copyrights trademarks and trade secret laws licenses and restrictive agreements to establish and protect our proprietary rights in technology and products many of our products include software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties we may have to seek new licenses or renew existing licenses for thirdparty software and other intellectual property in the future as part of performing engineering services for customers our engineering services business uses certain software and other intellectual property licensed from third parties including that of our competitors 

competition 

we compete in the eda software and emulation hardware product markets most frequently with synopsys inc and mentor graphics corporation but also with numerous other eda providers such as ansys inc atrenta inc atoptech inc berkeley design automation inc jasper design automation inc zuken ltd and many others offering point solutions with manufacturers of electronic devices that have developed acquired or have the capability to develop their own eda products and with numerous electronics design and consulting companies in the area of design ip we compete with synopsys ceva inc and numerous smaller ip companies we generally compete on the basis of quality product features level of integration or compatibility with other tools price and payment terms 

certain competitive factors in the engineering services business differ from those of the products businesses while we compete with other eda companies in the engineering services business our principal competitors include independent engineering service businesses many of these companies are also customers and therefore use our product offerings in the delivery of their services or products while we still compete with these companies by focusing on the design of complex analog digital and mixedsignal ics and socs we have moved certain of our design services engineers to our research and development activities to further enhance our growing portfolio of design ip and to improve our competitive position in that scalable business 

international operations 

we have 54  sales offices design centers and research and development facilities approximately 60  of which are located outside of the united states we consider customer sales and support requirements the availability of a skilled workforce and costs and efficiencies among other relative benefits when determining what operations to locate internationally for additional information relating to our international operations including revenue and longlived assets by geographic area see note 19 in the notes to consolidated financial statements for risks related to our international operations see the discussion under the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations may adversely impact our financial condition and risks associated with our international operations could seriously harm our financial condition   under item 1a risk factors

 item 1a risk factors 

our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties including those described below that could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations cash flows and the trading price of our common stock 

risks related to our business 

uncertainty in the global economy in general and any potential downturn in the semiconductor and electronics industries in particular may negatively impact our business and reduce our bookings levels and revenue 

purchases of our products and services are dependent upon the commencement of new design projects by ic manufacturers and electronics systems companies the ic and electronics systems industries are cyclical and are characterized by constant and rapid technological change rapid product obsolescence and price erosion evolving standards short product life cycles and wide fluctuations in product supply and demand 

 the ic and electronic systems industries have also experienced significant downturns in connection with or in anticipation of maturing product cycles of both these industries and their customers products although the semiconductor industry experienced growth in 2010 semiconductor industry revenues for 2011 remained at levels similar to 2010 and decreased slightly during 2012 and 2013 according to preliminary reports spending on eda products and services grew moderately during fiscal 2012 and 2013 while spending on eda products and services has grown in recent years the current outlook for the semiconductor industry is uncertain and may result in a decrease in spending on eda products and services 

while we cannot predict global economic conditions uncertainty about future economic conditions and future decline in consumer spending could negatively impact our customers businesses reducing the number of new chip designs and their overall research and development spending including their spending on eda products and services and as a result decrease demand for our products decreased bookings for our products and services customer bankruptcies consolidation among our customers or problems or delays with our hardware suppliers or with the supply or delivery of our hardware products could also adversely affect our ability to grow our business or adversely affect our future revenues and financial results our future business and financial results are subject to considerable uncertainty that could impact our stock price if economic conditions deteriorate in the future or in particular if semiconductor industry revenues do not grow or our suppliers of our hardware components and products are subject to problems or delays our future revenues and financial results could be adversely affected however if economic conditions improve for our customers the positive impact on our revenues and financial results may be deferred due to cautious customer research and development spending and our mix of licenses that result in recurring revenue 

our failure to respond quickly to technological developments or our customers increasing technological requirements could make our products uncompetitive and obsolete 

the industries in which we compete experience rapid technology developments rapid changes in industry standards and customer requirements and frequent introductions and improvements of new products currently the industries we serve are experiencing the following trends 

 if we are unable to respond quickly and successfully to these trends we may lose our competitive position and our products or technologies may become obsolete to compete successfully we must develop acquire or license new products and improve our existing products and processes on a schedule that keeps pace with technological developments and the requirements for products addressing a broad spectrum of designers and designer expertise in our industries our hardware platforms must be enhanced periodically to reduce the likelihood that a competitor surpasses the capabilities we offer our introduction of new products could reduce the demand and revenue of our older products or affect their pricing we must also be able to support a range of changing computer software hardware platforms and customer preferences a rapid transition to different business models associated with cloud computing technologies could result in reduced revenue we cannot guarantee that we will be successful in keeping pace with all or any of the customer trends 

we have experienced varied operating results and our operating results for any particular fiscal period are affected by the timing of revenue recognition particularly for our hardware and ip products 

we have recorded net losses in the past and may record net losses in the future various factors affect our operating results and some of them are not within our control our operating results for any period are affected by the timing of revenue recognition particularly for our hardware and ip products 

a substantial portion of the product revenue related to our hardware business is recognized upon delivery and our forecasted revenue results are based in part on our expectations of hardware to be delivered in a particular quarter therefore changes in hardware bookings or deliveries relative to expectations will have a more immediate impact on our revenue than changes in software or services bookings for which revenue is generally recognized over time 

during fiscal 2013 we made significant investments to expand our ip offerings through among other things research and development and acquisitions as we continue to expand our ip offerings a portion of the revenue related to our ip bookings will be deferred until we complete and deliver the licensed ip to our customers as a result costs related to the research and development of the ip may be incurred prior to the recognition of the related revenue 

revenue related to our hardware and ip products is inherently difficult to predict because sales of our hardware and ip products depend on the commencement of new projects for the design and development of complex ics and systems by our customers our customers willingness to expend capital to deploy our hardware or ip products in those projects and the availability of our hardware or ip products for delivery therefore our hardware or ip sales may be delayed or may decrease if our customers delay or cancel projects because their spending is constrained or if there are problems or delays with the supply or delivery of our hardware or ip products or our hardware suppliers moreover the emulation hardware and ip markets are highly competitive and our customers may choose to purchase a competitors hardware or ip product based on cost performance or other factors these factors may result in lower revenue which would have an adverse effect on our business results of operations or cash flows 

our software license mix is such that a substantial proportion of licenses require ratable revenue recognition and we expect the license mix combined with the modest growth in spending by our customers in the semiconductor sector may make it difficult for us to rapidly increase our revenue in future fiscal periods the timing of our revenue recognition may be deferred until payments become due and payable from customers with nonlinear payment terms or as cash is collected from customers with low credit ratings 

we plan our operating expenses based on forecasted revenue expected business needs and other factors these expenses and the effect of longterm commitments are relatively fixed in the short term bookings and the related revenue are harder to forecast in a difficult economic environment if the macroeconomic environment weakens and we experience a shortfall in bookings our operating results could differ from our expectations because we may not be able to quickly reduce our expenses in response to shortterm business changes 

the methods estimates and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies have a significant impact on our results of operations see critical accounting estimates under part ii item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations such methods estimates and judgments are by their nature subject to substantial risks uncertainties and assumptions and factors may arise over time that may lead us to change our methods estimates and judgments changes in those methods estimates and judgments could significantly affect our results of operations 

historical results of operations should not be viewed as reliable indicators of our future performance if our revenue operating results or business outlook for future periods fall short of the levels expected by us securities analysts or investors the trading price of our common stock could decline 

we depend on sole suppliers for certain hardware components making us vulnerable to supply disruption and price fluctuation 

we depend on sole suppliers for certain hardware components our reliance on sole suppliers could result in product delivery problems and delays and reduced control over product pricing and quality though we prefer to have multiple sources to procure certain key components in some cases it is not practical or feasible to do so we may suffer a disruption in the supply of certain hardware components if we are unable to purchase sufficient components on a timely basis or at all for any reason any supply disruption including delay in delivery of components by our suppliers or the bankruptcy or shutdown of our suppliers could delay our production process and prevent us from delivering completed hardware products to customers or from supplying new evaluation units to customers which could have a negative impact on our revenue and operating results 

we have acquired and expect to acquire other companies and businesses and may not realize the expected benefits of these acquisitions 

we have acquired and expect to acquire other companies and businesses in the future during fiscal 2013 we made several acquisitions of ip businesses our future revenue growth and expansion of our ip business is heavily dependent on our successful integration of these acquisitions we may incur significant costs in connection with our potential transactions including acquisitions that are not consummated potential and completed acquisitions involve a number of risks if any of the following acquisitionrelated risks occur our business operating results or financial condition could be seriously harmed 

 10 

 in a number of our completed acquisitions we have agreed to make future payments either in the form of employee retention bonuses or contingent purchase price payments based on the performance of the acquired companies businesses or the employees who joined us with the acquired companies or businesses the performance goals pursuant to which these future payments may be made generally relate to the achievement by the acquired company or business or by the employees who joined us with the acquired company or business of certain specified bookings revenue run rate product proliferation product development or employee retention goals during a specified period following completion of the applicable acquisition the specific performance goal levels and amounts and timing of employee bonuses or contingent purchase price payments vary with each acquisition we may continue to use contingent purchase price payments in connection with acquisitions in the future and while we expect to derive value from an acquisition in excess of such contingent payment obligations we may be required to make certain contingent payments without deriving the anticipated value 

future acquisitions may involve issuances of stock as full or partial payment of the purchase price for the acquired company or business grants of restricted stock restricted stock units or stock options to employees of the acquired companies or businesses which may be dilutive to existing stockholders expenditure of substantial cash resources or the incurrence of a material amount of debt these arrangements may impact our liquidity financial position and results of operations 

the competition in our industries is substantial and we may not be able to continue to successfully compete in our industries 

the eda industry the commercial electronics engineering services industry and the ip industry are highly competitive if we fail to compete successfully in these industries it could seriously harm our business operating results or financial condition to compete in these industries we must identify and develop or acquire innovative and costcompetitive eda products integrate them into platforms and market them in a timely manner we may not be able to compete successfully in these industries factors that could affect our ability to compete successfully include 

 we compete in eda most frequently with synopsys inc and mentor graphics corporation but also with numerous other eda providers such as ansys inc atrenta inc atoptech inc berkeley design automation inc jasper design automation inc zuken ltd and many others offering point solutions with manufacturers of electronic devices that have developed acquired or have the capability to develop their own eda products and with numerous electronics design and consulting companies in the area of design ip we compete with synopsys ceva inc and numerous smaller ip companies during fiscal 2012 synopsys acquired magma design automation inc eve sa and springsoft inc we expect that synopsys integration of these companies products into its product offerings will result in increased competitive pressures that could harm our business results of operations or cash flows 

warrant transactions associated with our convertible notes will in certain circumstances dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders 

at the time of issuance of our convertible notes due in 2015 we entered into separate warrant transactions for the purchase of up to approximately 464 million  shares of our common stock at a strike price of 1078  per share these warrants expire on various dates from september 2015 through december 2015 these warrants will be settled in net shares therefore upon expiration of the warrants we will issue shares of our common stock to the purchasers of the warrants that represent the value by which the price of our common stock exceeds the strike price stipulated within the particular warrant agreement if our stock price is above the warrants strike price upon expiration of the warrants the warrants will dilute the ownership interest of our existing stockholders the warrants will also dilute our diluted earnings per share in periods when our average closing stock price exceeds the strike price of the particular warrant any sales in the public market of common stock issuable upon net settlement at expiration of the warrants could adversely affect then current market prices of our common stock additional risk factors related to our indebtedness are described below under risks related to our securities and indebtedness 

the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations may adversely impact our revenue expenses cash flows and financial condition 

we have significant operations outside the united states our revenue from international operations as a percentage of total revenue was approximately 56  during fiscal 2013  and 57  during both fiscal 2012  and 2011  we expect that revenue from our international operations will continue to account for a significant portion of our total revenue we also transact business in various foreign currencies the volatility of foreign currencies in certain countries where we conduct business most notably the japanese yen european union euro british pound and indian rupee have had and may in the future have an effect on our revenue or operating results 

fluctuations in the rate of exchange between the united states or us dollar and the currencies of other countries where we conduct business could seriously affect our business operating results or financial condition for example when a foreign currency declines in value relative to the us dollar it takes more of the foreign currency to purchase the same amount of us dollars than before the change if we price our products and services in the foreign currency we receive fewer us dollars than we did before the change if we price our products and services in us dollars the decrease in value of the local currency results in an increase in the price for our products and services compared to those products of our competitors that are priced in local currency this could result in our prices being uncompetitive in markets where business is transacted in the local currency on the other hand when a foreign currency increases in value relative to the us dollar it takes more us dollars to purchase the same amount of the foreign currency as we use the foreign currency to fund payroll costs and other operating expenses in our international operations this results in an increase in operating expenses our attempts to reduce the effect of foreign currency fluctuations may be unsuccessful and significant exchange rate movements may adversely impact our results of operations as expressed in us dollars 

our stock price has been subject to fluctuations and may continue to be subject to fluctuations 

the market price of our common stock has experienced fluctuations and may fluctuate or decline in the future and as a result you could lose the value of your investment the market price of our common stock may be affected by a number of factors including but not limited to 

 in addition equity markets in general and the equities of technology companies in particular have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations such price and volume fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock for reasons unrelated to our business or operating results 

our future revenue is dependent in part upon our installed customer base continuing to license or buy additional products and purchase additional services 

our installed customer base has traditionally generated additional new license service and maintenance revenues in future periods customers may not necessarily license or buy additional products or contract for additional services or maintenance our customers many of which are large semiconductor and systems companies often have significant bargaining power in negotiations with us mergers or acquisitions of our customers can reduce the total level of purchases of our software and services and in some cases increase customers bargaining power in negotiations with their suppliers including us 

competitive pressures may require us to change our pricing which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

the highly competitive markets in which we do business can put pressure on us to reduce the prices of our products if our competitors offer deep discounts on certain products in an effort to recapture or gain market share or to sell other software or hardware products we may then need to lower our prices or offer other favorable terms to compete successfully any such changes would be likely to reduce our profit margins and could adversely affect our operating results any substantial changes to our prices and pricing policies could cause sales and software license revenues to decline or be delayed as our sales force implements and our customers adjust to the new pricing policies some of our competitors bundle products for promotional purposes or as a longterm pricing strategy or provide guarantees of prices and product implementations these practices could over time significantly constrain the prices that we can charge for our products if we cannot offset price reductions with a corresponding increase in the number of sales or with lower spending then the reduced license revenues resulting from lower prices could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

litigation could adversely affect our financial condition or operations 

we currently are and in the future may be involved in various disputes and litigation that arise in the ordinary course of business these include disputes and lawsuits related to intellectual property including customer indemnification mergers and acquisitions licensing contracts distribution arrangements and employee relations matters for information regarding the litigation matters in which we are currently engaged please refer to the discussion under item 3 legal proceedings and note 15 in the notes to consolidated financial statements we cannot provide any assurances that the final outcome of these lawsuits or any other proceedings that may arise in the future will not have a material adverse effect on our business operating results financial condition or cash flows litigation can be time consuming and expensive and could divert managements time and attention from our business which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and operating results 

risks associated with our international operations could seriously harm our financial condition 

a significant amount of our revenue is derived from our international operations and we have offices throughout the world including key research and development facilities outside of the united states our international operations may be subject to a number of risks including 

 13 

some of our international research and development and other facilities are in parts of the world where there may be a greater risk of business interruption as a result of political instability terrorist acts or military conflicts than businesses located domestically furthermore this potential harm is exacerbated because damage to or disruptions at our international research and development facilities could have a more significant adverse effect on our ability to develop new or improve existing products than other businesses that may only have sales offices or other less critical operations abroad we are not insured for losses or interruptions caused by acts of war furthermore our operations are dependent upon the connectivity of our operations throughout the world activities that interfere with our international connectivity such as cyber hacking the introduction of a virus into our computer systems or natural disasters near any of our international locations could significantly interfere with our business operations 

in addition internal controls policies and procedures and employee training and compliance programs that we have implemented to deter prohibited practices may not prevent our employees contractors or agents from violating or circumventing our policies and the laws and regulations applicable to our worldwide operations 

we depend upon our management team and key employees and our failure to attract train motivate and retain management and key employees may make us less competitive and therefore harm our results of operations 

our business depends upon the continued services efforts and abilities of our senior management and other key employees competition for highly skilled executive officers and employees can be intense particularly in geographic areas recognized as high technology centers such as the silicon valley area where our principal offices are located and in other locations where we maintain facilities in addition competition for qualified personnel in the eda commercial electronics engineering services and ip industries has intensified we may also experience increased compensation costs that are not offset by either improved productivity or higher sales we may not be successful in recruiting new personnel and in retaining and motivating existing personnel from time to time there may be changes in our management team resulting from the hiring and departure of executive officers and as a result we may experience disruption to our business that may harm our operating results and our relationships with our employees customers and suppliers may be adversely affected 

to attract retain and motivate individuals with the requisite expertise we may be required to grant large numbers of stock options or other stockbased incentive awards which may be dilutive to existing stockholders and increase compensation expense and pay significant base salaries and cash bonuses which could harm our operating results the high cost of training new employees not fully utilizing these employees or losing trained employees to competing employers could also reduce our operating margins and harm our business or operating results 

in addition applicable rules and regulations require stockholder approval for new equity compensation plans and significant amendments to existing equity compensation plans including increases in shares available for issuance under such plans and prohibit publiclytraded companies from giving a proxy to vote on equity compensation plans unless the beneficial owner of the shares has given voting instructions these rules and regulations could make it more difficult for us to grant equity compensation to employees in the future to the extent that these regulations make it more difficult or expensive to grant equity compensation to employees we may incur increased compensation costs or find it difficult to attract retain and motivate employees which could materially and adversely affect our business 

we may not receive significant revenue from our current research and development efforts for several years if at all 

developing eda products and ip and integrating acquired technology into existing platforms is expensive and these investments often require substantial time to generate returns our strategy involves significant investments in research and development and related product opportunities we believe that we must continue to dedicate a significant amount of resources to our research and development efforts to maintain and improve our competitive position however we cannot ensure that we will receive significant if any revenue from these investments 

we could suffer serious harm to our business because of the infringement of our intellectual property rights by third parties or because of our infringement of the intellectual property rights of third parties 

there are numerous eda vip and design ip productrelated patents new patents are being issued at a rapid rate and are owned by eda companies as well as entities and individuals outside the eda industry including parties whose income is primarily derived from infringementrelated litigation it is not always practicable to determine in advance whether a product or any of its components infringes the patent rights of others as a result from time to time we may be compelled to respond to or prosecute intellectual property infringement claims to protect our rights or defend a customers rights 

intellectual property infringement claims including contractual defense reimbursement obligations related to thirdparty claims against our customers regardless of merit could consume valuable management time result in costly litigation or cause product shipment delays all of which could seriously harm our business operating results or financial condition the risk of infringement and related indemnification claims associated with design ip products that are incorporated into a customer product broadly used by consumers may be higher than the risk associated with our software products in settling these claims we may be required to enter into royalty or licensing agreements with the third parties claiming infringement these royalty or licensing agreements if available may not have terms favorable to us being compelled to enter into a license agreement with unfavorable terms could seriously harm our business operating results or financial condition any potential intellectual property litigation could compel us to do one or more of the following 

 if we were compelled to take any of these actions our business or operating results may suffer 

we rely on our proprietary technology as well as software and other intellectual property rights licensed to us by third parties and we cannot assure you that the precautions taken to protect our rights will be adequate or that we will continue to be able to adequately secure such intellectual property rights from third parties 

our success depends in part upon our proprietary technology we generally rely on patents copyrights trademarks trade secrets licenses and restrictive agreements to establish and protect our proprietary rights in technology and products despite the precautions we may take to protect our intellectual property third parties have tried in the past and may try in the future to challenge invalidate or circumvent these safeguards our patents and other intellectual property rights may not provide us with sufficient competitive advantages patents may not be issued on any of our pending applications and our issued patents may not be sufficiently broad to protect our technology furthermore the laws of foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights in those countries to the same extent as applicable law protects these rights in the united states the protection of our intellectual property may require the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources moreover the steps we take to protect our intellectual property may not adequately protect our rights or deter or prevent third parties from infringing or misappropriating our proprietary rights 

many of our products include software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties we may have to seek new or renew existing licenses for such software and other intellectual property in the future our engineering services business holds licenses to certain software and other intellectual property owned by third parties including that of our competitors our failure to obtain software other intellectual property licenses or other intellectual property rights that are necessary or helpful for our business on favorable terms or our need to engage in litigation over these licenses or rights could seriously harm our business operating results or financial condition 

our operating results and revenue could be adversely affected by customer payment delays customer bankruptcies and defaults or modifications of licenses 

occasionally our customers file for bankruptcy or request to modify license terms if our customers experience adversity in their business they may delay or default on their payment obligations to us file for bankruptcy or modify or cancel plans to license our products for instance if our customers are not successful in generating sufficient cash or are precluded from securing financing they may not be able to pay or may delay payment of accounts receivable that are owed to us although these obligations are generally not cancelable our customers inability to fulfill payment obligations in turn may adversely affect our revenue and cash flow additionally our customers have in the past sought and may in the future seek to renegotiate preexisting contractual commitments payment defaults by our customers or significant reductions in existing contractual commitments could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results because of the relatively high levels of volatility that continue to drive significant fluctuations in asset prices as well as concern regarding high levels of leverage in sovereign and corporate debt the capital and credit markets are volatile and unpredictable if we were to seek funding from the capital or credit markets in response to any material level of customer defaults we may not be able to secure funding on terms acceptable to us or at all which may have a material negative effect on our business 

if our security measures are breached and an unauthorized party obtains access to customer data or our proprietary business information our information systems may be perceived as being unsecure which could harm our business and reputation 

our products and services involve the storage and transmission of our proprietary information and that of our customers we have offices throughout the world including key research and development facilities outside of the united states our operations are dependent upon the connectivity of our operations throughout the world despite our security measures our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to cyber attacks or breached due to an employee error or other disruption that could result in unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information and could significantly interfere with our business operations breaches of our security measures could expose us to a risk of loss or misuse of this information litigation and potential liability because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage information systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventive measures in addition if we select a vendor that uses cyber storage of information as part of their service or product offerings despite our attempts to validate the security of such services our proprietary information may be misappropriated by third parties in the event of an actual or perceived breach of our security or the security of one of our vendors the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed and we could suffer damage to our reputation or our business or lose existing customers and our ability to obtain new customers 

the long sales cycle of our products and services may cause our operating results to fluctuate unexpectedly 

generally we have a long sales cycle that can extend up to six months or longer the complexity and expense associated with our products and services generally require a lengthy customer education evaluation and approval process consequently we may incur substantial expenses and devote significant management effort and expense to develop potential relationships that do not result in agreements or revenue and may prevent us from pursuing other opportunities 

in addition sales of our products and services have been and may in the future be delayed if customers delay approval or commencement of projects because of 

 long sales cycles for hardware products subject us to a number of significant risks over which we have limited control including insufficient excess or obsolete inventory variations in inventory valuation and fluctuations in quarterly operating results 

we have substantial cash requirements in the united states but a significant portion of our cash is held and generated outside of the united states and if our cash available in the united states and the cash available under our revolving credit facility is insufficient to meet our operating expenses and debt repayment obligations in the united states then we may be required to raise cash in ways that could negatively affect our financial condition results of operations and the market price of our common stock 

we have significant operations outside the united states as of december 28 2013  approximately 70  of our cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments balance was held by subsidiaries outside the united states with the remainder of the balance held by us or our subsidiaries in the united states we believe that the combination of our existing united states cash cash equivalents future united states operating cash flows and cash available under our revolving credit facility are sufficient to meet our ongoing united states operating expenses and debt repayment obligations however if these sources of cash were insufficient to meet our future funding obligations in the united states we could be required to seek other available funding sources which could negatively impact our results of operations financial position and the market price of our common stock 

the investment of our cash cash equivalents and investments in money market funds and marketable debt securities are subject to risks which may cause losses and affect the liquidity of these investments 

our investments include various money market funds and marketable debt securities such as corporate debt securities us treasury securities us government agency securities bank certificates of deposit and commercial paper weakened financial markets have at times adversely impacted the general credit liquidity market prices and interest rates for these and other types of debt securities additionally changes in monetary policy by the federal open market committee and concerns about the rising us government debt level may cause a decrease in the purchasing power of the us dollar and adversely affect our investment portfolio furthermore if there is a default or downgrade of us government or agency debt securities our investment portfolio may be adversely impacted requiring impairment charges that could adversely affect our liquidity financial position results of operations or cash flows the financial market and monetary risks associated with our investment portfolio may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition liquidity results of operations or cash flows 

our operating results could be adversely affected as a result of changes in our effective tax rates or by material differences between our forecasted annual effective tax rates and actual tax rates 

our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by the following 

 any significant change in our future effective tax rates could adversely impact our results of operations for future periods 

forecasts of our annual effective tax rate are complex and subject to uncertainty because our income tax position for each year combines the effects of estimating our annual income or loss the mix of profits and losses earned by us and our subsidiaries in tax jurisdictions with a broad range of income tax rates as well as benefits from available deferred tax assets the impact of various accounting rules and results of tax audits forecasts of our annual effective tax rate do not include the anticipation of future tax law changes if there were a material difference between forecasted and actual tax rates then it could have a material impact on our results of operations 

our reported financial results may be adversely affected by changes in united states generally accepted accounting principles and we may incur significant costs to adjust our accounting systems and processes to comply with significant changes 

united states generally accepted accounting principles are subject to interpretation by the financial accounting standards board or fasb the american institute of certified public accountants the sec and various bodies formed to promulgate and interpret appropriate accounting principles during fiscal 2010 the fasb issued exposure drafts of proposed accounting principles related to revenue recognition and leases which could change the way we account for certain of our transactions the fasb issued a revised exposure draft of proposed accounting principles related to revenue recognition during fiscal 2011 and continued to discuss these and other proposed accounting principles during fiscal 2013  a change in these or other principles or interpretations could have a significant effect on our reported financial results and could affect the reporting of transactions completed before the announcement of a change in addition the sec is considering a multiyear plan that could ultimately lead to the use of international financial reporting standards by united states issuers in their sec filings any such change could have a significant effect on our reported financial results 

in addition we may need to significantly change our accounting systems and processes if we are required to adopt the proposed changes in accounting principles noted above the cost of these changes may negatively impact our results of operations during the periods of transition 

the irs and other tax authorities regularly examine our tax returns and the outcome of current and future tax examinations may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows 

the irs and other tax authorities regularly examine our income tax returns the calculation of our provision benefit for income taxes requires us to use significant judgment and involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in determining the adequacy of our provision benefit for income taxes we regularly assess the potential settlement outcomes resulting from income tax examinations however the final outcome of tax examinations including the total amount payable or the timing of any such payments upon resolution of these issues cannot be estimated with certainty in addition we cannot be certain that such amount will not be materially different from the amount that is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals should the irs or other tax authorities assess additional taxes as a result of a current or a future examination we may be required to record charges to operations in future periods that could have a material impact on our results of operations financial position or cash flows in the applicable period or periods 

our restructuring plans may not result in the benefits we have anticipated possibly having a negative effect on our future operating results 

in recent fiscal years we have initiated restructuring plans in an effort to decrease costs by reducing our workforce and by consolidating facilities we incur substantial costs to implement restructuring plans and our restructuring activities may subject us to litigation risks and expenses in addition our restructuring plans may have other consequences such as attrition beyond our planned reduction in workforce a negative effect on employee morale or our ability to attract highly skilled employees our competitors may also use our restructuring plans to seek to gain a competitive advantage over us the restructuring plans could also cause our remaining employees to leave or result in reduced productivity by our employees and in turn this may affect our revenue and other operating results in the future 

failure to obtain export licenses could harm our business by rendering us unable to ship products and transfer our technology outside of the united states 

we must comply with regulations of the united states and of certain other countries in shipping our products and transferring our technology outside the united states and to foreign nationals any significant future difficulty in complying could harm our business operating results or financial condition 

errors or defects in our products and services could expose us to liability and harm our business 

our customers use our products and services in designing and developing products that involve a high degree of technological complexity each of which has its own specifications because of the complexity of the systems and products with which we work some of our products and designs can be adequately tested only when put to full use in the marketplace as a result our customers or their end users may discover errors or defects in our software or the systems we design or the products or systems incorporating our design and intellectual property may not operate as expected errors or defects could result in 

 if we become subject to unfair hiring claims we could be prevented from hiring needed employees incur liability for damages and incur substantial costs in defending ourselves 

when companies in our industry lose employees to competitors they frequently claim that these competitors have engaged in unfair hiring practices or that the employment of these persons would involve the disclosure or use of trade secrets these claims could prevent us from hiring employees or cause us to incur liability for damages we could also incur substantial costs in defending ourselves or our employees against these claims regardless of their merits defending ourselves from these claims could also divert the attention of our management away from our operations 

antitakeover defenses in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and certain provisions under delaware law could prevent an acquisition of our company or limit the price that investors might be willing to pay for our common stock 

our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and certain provisions of the delaware general corporation law that apply to us could make it difficult for another company to acquire control of our company for example 

 all or any one of these factors could limit the price that certain investors would be willing to pay for shares of our common stock and could allow our board of directors to resist delay or prevent an acquisition of our company even if a proposed transaction were favored by a majority of our independent stockholders 

new conflict minerals regulations may cause us to incur additional expenses and may adversely impact our ability to conduct our business 

in august 2012 the sec adopted new rules establishing disclosure and reporting requirements regarding the use of certain minerals referred to as conflict minerals in products these new rules will require us to determine disclose and report whether or not such conflict minerals originate from the democratic republic of the congo or adjoining countries in addition these new rules could affect our ability to source certain materials used in our hardware products at competitive prices and could impact the availability of certain minerals used in the manufacture of our hardware products our customers may require that our hardware products be free of conflict minerals and our revenues may be harmed if we are unable to procure conflictfree minerals at a reasonable price we also expect that there may be material costs associated with complying with the disclosure requirements such as costs related to determining the source of certain minerals used in our products as well as costs related to possible changes to our hardware products processes or sources of supply as a consequence of such disclosure and reporting requirements 

our business is subject to the risk of earthquakes and other natural disasters 

our corporate headquarters including certain of our research and development operations and certain of our distribution facilities is located in the silicon valley area of northern california a region known to experience seismic activity if significant seismic activity were to occur our operations may be interrupted which could adversely impact our business and results of operations 

our other offices in the united states and in other countries around the world may be adversely impacted by natural disasters if a natural disaster occurs at or near any of our offices our operations may be interrupted which could adversely impact our business and results of operations if a natural disaster impacts a significant number of our customers our business and results of operations could be adversely impacted 

risks related to our securities and indebtedness 

our debt obligations expose us to risks that could adversely affect our business operating results or financial condition and could prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under such indebtedness 

we have a substantial level of debt and as of december 28 2013  we had the ability to borrow an additional 2500 million  under a revolving credit facility as of december 28 2013  we had total outstanding indebtedness with a principal balance of 3500 million  related to our 2625 cash convertible senior notes due 2015 or the 2015 notes 

the level of our current or future indebtedness among other things could 

 any outstanding loans drawn under our 2500 million  fiveyear senior secured revolving credit facility are payable on or before december 12 2017  we have the option to increase the maximum borrowings on our credit facility up to an additional 1500 million  if our lenders approve our request the credit facility contains customary negative covenants that among other things restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness grant liens make certain investments including acquisitions dispose of certain assets and make certain payments including share repurchases and dividends in addition the credit facility contains certain financial covenants that require us to maintain a leverage ratio of not greater than 3 to 1 subject to certain exceptions and requires that we maintain an interest coverage ratio of at least 3 to 1 these financial covenants could limit our flexibility in conducting our business and any borrowings outstanding under the credit facility could be accelerated if we fail to comply with these covenants 

if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow or otherwise obtain funds necessary to make required payments or if we fail to comply with the various requirements of our indebtedness we would be in default which would permit the holders of our indebtedness to accelerate the maturity of the indebtedness and could cause defaults under any other indebtedness as well additionally in the event of a default certain assets that secure the borrowings could be seized by our lenders which could adversely impact our ability to operate 

any default under our indebtedness could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition in addition a material default on our indebtedness could suspend our eligibility to register securities using certain registration statement forms under sec guidelines that permit incorporation by reference of substantial information regarding us potentially hindering our ability to raise capital through the issuance of our securities and increasing our costs of registration 

conversion of our 2015 notes prior to the scheduled maturities of the notes may adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition 

holders of our 2015 notes may convert their notes into cash prior to the scheduled maturities if any of the conversion conditions for those notes are met the 2015 notes are convertible into cash only 

in order for the 2015 notes to be convertible into cash in a particular fiscal quarter a conversion condition must be met during the preceding fiscal quarter during the three  months ended december 28 2013  our closing stock price exceeded 981  for at least 20  of the last 30  trading days prior to december 28 2013  as a result the 2015 notes are convertible into cash from december 29 2013  through march 29 2014  and we have classified our 2015 notes as a current liability on our consolidated balance sheet as of december 28 2013  

so long as the 2015 notes are outstanding we will assess whether this conversion condition has been met at the end of each fiscal quarter if a conversion condition is met in any future fiscal quarter we will classify our 2015 notes as a current liability on our consolidated balance sheet as of the end of that fiscal quarter 

if one or more of the 2015 note holders elect to convert their notes at a time when the conversion conditions have been met we would be required to settle the converted principal and the conversion value through payment of cash earlier than the contractual maturity which could adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition 

at the option of the holders of the 2015 notes under certain circumstances we may be required to repurchase the 2015 notes in cash 

under the terms of the 2015 notes we may be required to repurchase the 2015 notes following a fundamental change in our corporate ownership or structure such as a change of control in which substantially all of the consideration does not consist of publicly traded securities prior to maturity of the 2015 notes the repurchase price for the 2015 notes in the event of a fundamental change must be paid solely in cash this repayment obligation may have the effect of discouraging delaying or preventing a takeover of our company payment of the notes prior to their scheduled maturities could have a significant negative impact on our cash and liquidity and could impact our ability to invest financial resources in other strategic initiatives 

hedge and warrant transactions entered into in connection with the issuance of the 2015 notes may affect the value of our common stock 

we entered into hedge transactions with various financial institutions at the time of issuance of the 2015 notes with the objective of limiting our exposure to the additional cash payments above the principal amount upon conversion of the 2015 notes we also entered into separate warrant transactions with the same financial institutions in connection with our hedge and warrant transactions associated with the 2015 notes these financial institutions purchased our common stock in secondary market transactions and entered into various overthecounter derivative transactions with respect to our common stock these entities or their affiliates are likely to modify their hedge positions from time to time prior to conversion or maturity of the 2015 notes by purchasing and selling shares of our common stock other of our securities or other instruments they may wish to use in connection with such hedging any of these transactions and activities could adversely affect the value of our common stock and as a result the amount of cash that 2015 notes holders will receive upon conversion of the 2015 notes 

we are subject to the risk that the hedge participants fail to fulfill their obligations under the 2015 notes hedge transactions 

if any of the participants in the hedge transactions is unwilling or unable to perform its obligations for any reason we would not be able to receive the benefit of such transaction we cannot provide any assurances as to the financial stability or viability of any of the participants in the hedge transactions our 2015 notes were convertible as of december 28 2013  the convertible note hedge transactions in connection with the 2015 notes or the 2015 notes hedges are intended to reduce our exposure above the 3500 million  principal balance in the event of a cash conversion of the 2015 notes if the hedge participants fail to meet their obligations for any reason it could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and financial condition 

rating agencies may provide unsolicited ratings on the 2015 notes that could reduce the market value or liquidity of our 2015 notes or our common stock 

we have not requested a rating of the 2015 notes from any rating agency and we do not anticipate that the 2015 notes will be rated however if one or more rating agencies independently elects to rate the 2015 notes and assigns the 2015 notes a rating lower than the rating expected by investors or reduces such rating in the future the market price or liquidity of the 2015 notes as the case may be and our common stock could be harmed should a decline occur in the market price of the 2015 notes as compared to the price of our common stock the decline may trigger the right of the holders of the 2015 notes to convert such notes into cash as applicable

 item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

  

the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k and with part i item 1a risk factors please refer to the cautionary language at the beginning of part i of this annual report on form 10k regarding forwardlooking statements 

business overview 

we develop solutions that our customers use to design increasingly small and complex integrated circuits or ics and electronic devices our solutions are designed to help our customers reduce the time to bring an ic or electronic device to market and to reduce their designdevelopment and manufacturing costs our product offerings include eda software emulation hardware and two categories of intellectual property or ip commonly referred to as verification ip or vip and design ip we provide maintenance for our hardware software and ip product offerings we also provide engineering services related to methodology education hosted design solutions and design services for advanced ics and development of custom ip which help our customers manage and accelerate their electronics product development processes 

during fiscal 2013 we acquired tensilica inc or tensilica a privately held provider of configurable dataplane processing units and cosmic circuits private limited or cosmic a privately held provider of intellectual property used in systemonchip design these acquisitions along with other acquired technology and internal development expanded our design ip offering enabling us to offer customized ip as well as broader analog and mixed signal ip solutions to our customers 

substantially all of our business is generated from semiconductor and electronics systems companies that deliver a wide range of electronics products in a number of market segments the renewal of many of our customer contracts and the decisions for new purchases are dependent upon our customers commencement of new design projects as a result our business is significantly influenced by our customers business outlook and investment in new designs and products 

we have identified certain items that management uses as performance indicators to manage our business including revenue certain elements of operating expenses and cash flow from operations and we describe these items further below under results of operations and liquidity and capital resources 

critical accounting estimates 

in preparing our consolidated financial statements we make assumptions judgments and estimates that can have a significant impact on our revenue operating income and net income as well as on the value of certain assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets we base our assumptions judgments and estimates on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions at least quarterly we evaluate our assumptions judgments and estimates and make changes as deemed necessary we believe that the assumptions judgments and estimates involved in the accounting for income taxes revenue recognition business combinations intangible asset and goodwill impairments and fair value of financial instruments have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements therefore we consider these to be our critical accounting estimates for information on our significant accounting policies see note 2 in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

accounting for income taxes 

we provide for the effect of income taxes in our consolidated financial statements using the asset and liability method we also apply a twostep approach to determine the financial statement recognition and measurement of uncertain tax positions 

we must make significant assumptions judgments and estimates to determine our current provision benefit for income taxes our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance to be recorded against our deferred tax assets our judgments assumptions and estimates relating to the current provision benefit for income taxes include the geographic mix and amount of income loss our interpretation of current tax laws and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax authorities our judgments also include anticipating the tax positions we will take on tax returns before actually preparing and filing the tax returns changes in our business tax laws or our interpretation of tax laws and developments in current and future tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our results of operations financial position or cash flows 

deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to tax benefit carryforwards and to differences between the financial statement amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis we regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized to make this judgment we must make predictions of the amount and category of taxable income from various sources and weigh all available positive and negative evidence about these possible sources of taxable income we give greater weight to evidence that can be objectively verified for the year ended december 28 2013  we judged that our history of operating profits in the united states and our expectations of future profits considering our software ratable revenue recognition model and ending backlog of revenue as of december 28 2013  were sufficient positive evidence to determine that a significant portion of our united states deferred tax assets is more likely than not to be realized in future years however if in the future we determine that we no longer meet the realization threshold for some or all of our deferred tax assets then we would need to establish a valuation allowance that could result in a material provision for income taxes in the period such determination is made for an additional description of the valuation allowance see note 6 in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

we only recognize the tax benefit of an income tax position if we judge that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained solely on its technical merits in a tax audit including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes to make this judgment we must interpret complex and sometimes ambiguous tax laws regulations and administrative practices if we judge that an income tax position meets this recognition threshold then we must measure the amount of the tax benefit to be recognized by estimating the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50 cumulative probability of being realized upon effective settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all of the relevant facts it is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts as this requires us to determine the probability of various possible settlement outcomes to determine when a tax position is effectively settled we must estimate the likelihood that a taxing authority would rereview a tax position after a tax examination has otherwise been completed we must also determine when it is reasonably possible that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits will significantly increase or decrease in the 12 months after each fiscal yearend these judgments are difficult because a taxing authority may change its behavior as a result of our disclosures in our financial statements or for other reasons in addition we are required by the irs to disclose uncertain tax positions taken on our federal tax returns we must reevaluate our income tax positions on a quarterly basis to consider factors such as changes in facts or circumstances changes in tax law effectively settled issues under audit the lapse of applicable statute of limitations and new audit activity such a change in recognition or measurement would result in recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision for additional descriptions of our unrecognized tax benefits see note 6 in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition 

we begin to recognize revenue when all of the following criteria are met 

 significant judgment is involved in the determination of whether the facts and circumstances of an arrangement support that the fee for the arrangement is considered to be fixed or determinable and that collectibility of the fee is probable and these judgments can affect the amount of revenue that we recognize in a particular reporting period for installment contracts that do not include a substantial upfront payment we consider a fee to be fixed or determinable only if the arrangement has payment periods that are less than or equal to the term of the licenses and the payments are collected in equal or nearly equal installments when evaluated over the entire term of the arrangement if we no longer were to have a history of collecting under the original contract without providing concessions on term licenses revenue from term licenses would be required to be recognized when payments under the installment contract become due and payable such a change could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

we must also make these judgments when assessing whether a contract amendment to a term arrangement primarily in the context of a license extension or renewal constitutes a concession we have established a history of collecting under contracts for which the fee has been assessed as fixed or determinable without providing concessions on payments products or services 

generally we are able to estimate whether collection is probable but significant judgment is applied as we assess the creditworthiness of our customers to make this determination key external and internal factors are considered in developing our creditworthiness assessment including public information historical and current financial statements and past collection history if our experience were to change it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations if in our judgment collection of a fee is not probable we do not record revenue until the uncertainty is removed which is generally upon receipt of cash payment 

in general revenue associated with term and subscription licenses is recognized ratably over the term of the license commencing upon the later of the effective date of the arrangement or delivery of the first software product in general product revenue associated with term and perpetual licenses where vendor specific objective evidence or vsoe exists for the undelivered maintenance is recognized upfront upon the later of the effective date of the arrangement or delivery of the software product provided all other conditions for revenue recognition have been met and maintenance revenue is recognized ratably over the maintenance term a relatively small percentage of our revenue from software licenses is recognized on an upfront basis 

our hardware products generally include the hardware product and its related essential software and maintenance for the hardware and the essential software consideration allocated to the hardware product and the essential software is recognized as revenue at the time of delivery provided all other conditions for revenue recognition have been met consideration allocated to the maintenance is recognized ratably over the maintenance term 

revenue from services contracts is recognized either on the time and materials method as work is performed or on the percentageofcompletion method if a service contract is considered to be part of a multiple element arrangement or mea that includes a software contract revenue is generally recognized ratably over the duration of the software contract for contracts with fixed or nottoexceed fees we estimate on a monthly basis the percentage of completion based on the completion of milestones relating to the arrangement we have a history of accurately estimating project status and the costs necessary to complete projects a number of internal and external factors can affect our estimates including labor rates utilization and efficiency variances and specification and testing requirement changes if different conditions were to prevail such that accurate estimates could not be made then the use of the completed contract method would be required and the recognition of all revenue and costs would be deferred until the project was completed such a change could have a material impact on our results of operations 

if a group of contracts is so closely related that they are in effect part of a single arrangement such arrangements are deemed to be an mea we exercise significant judgment to evaluate the relevant facts and circumstances in determining whether the separate contracts should be accounted for individually as distinct arrangements or whether the separate contracts are in substance an mea our judgments about whether a group of contracts is an mea can affect the timing of revenue recognition under those contracts which could have an effect on our results of operations for the periods involved for example a term or perpetual license agreement that would otherwise result in upfront revenue upon delivery may be deemed part of an mea when it is executed within close proximity or in contemplation of other license agreements that require ratable revenue recognition with the same customer in which event all the revenue is recognized over the longest term of any component of the mea instead of up front 

for an mea that includes software and nonsoftware elements we allocate consideration to all software elements as a group and all nonsoftware elements based on their relative standalone selling prices revenue allocated to each deliverable is then recognized when all four criteria are met in these circumstances there is a hierarchy to determine the standalone selling price to be used for allocating consideration to the deliverables as follows 

• vendorspecific objective evidence of fair value or vsoe 

• thirdparty evidence of selling price or tpe and 

• best estimate of the selling price or besp 

we calculate the besp of our hardware products based on our pricing practices including the historical average prices charged for comparable hardware products because vsoe or tpe cannot be established our process for determining besp for our software deliverables without vsoe or tpe takes into account multiple factors that vary depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each deliverable key external and internal factors considered in developing the besps include prices charged by us for similar arrangements historical pricing practices and the nature of the product in addition when developing besps we may consider other factors as appropriate including the pricing of competitive alternatives if they exist and productspecific business objectives we exercise significant judgment to evaluate the relevant facts and circumstances in calculating the besp of the deliverables in our arrangements 

business combinations 

when we acquire businesses we allocate the purchase price to the acquired tangible assets and assumed liabilities including deferred revenue liabilities associated with the fair value of contingent consideration and acquired identifiable intangible assets any residual purchase price is recorded as goodwill the allocation of the purchase price requires us to make significant estimates in determining the fair values of these acquired assets and assumed liabilities especially with respect to intangible assets and goodwill these estimates are based on information obtained from management of the acquired companies our assessment of this information and historical experience these estimates can include but are not limited to the cash flows that an acquired business is expected to generate in the future the cash flows that specific assets acquired with that business are expected to generate in the future the appropriate weightedaverage cost of capital and the cost savings expected to be derived from acquiring an asset these estimates are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and if different estimates were used the purchase price for the acquisition could be allocated to the acquired assets and assumed liabilities differently from the allocation that we have made to the acquired assets and assumed liabilities in addition unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that may affect the accuracy or validity of such estimates and if such events occur we may be required to adjust the value allocated to acquired assets or assumed liabilities 

we also make significant judgments and estimates when we assign useful lives to the definite lived intangible assets identified as part of our acquisitions these estimates are inherently uncertain and if we used different estimates the useful life over which we amortize intangible assets would be different in addition unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that may impact the useful life assigned to our intangible assets which would impact our amortization of intangible assets expense and our results of operations 

intangible asset and goodwill impairments 

we assess the impairment of longlived assets including certain intangibles whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that we will not be able to recover an asset groups carrying amount recoverability of an asset group is measured by comparing its carrying amount to the expected future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of that asset group excluding future interest costs that would be recognized as an expense when incurred any impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds its fair market value significant management judgment is required in 

 we test goodwill for impairment annually or whenever events and changes in circumstances suggest that the carrying amount may not be recoverable the test is performed at the reporting unit level by comparing the reporting units carrying amount including goodwill to the fair value of the reporting unit we operate as a single reporting unit the fair value of the reporting unit is estimated and if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value goodwill is considered to be impaired and a second step is performed to measure the amount of the impairment loss 

we completed our annual goodwill impairment test during the third quarter of fiscal 2013  and determined that the fair value of our single reporting unit substantially exceeded the carrying amount of our net assets and that no impairment existed 

fair value of financial instruments 

on a quarterly basis we measure at fair value certain financial assets and liabilities including the hedge and embedded conversion derivative associated with our 2625  cash convertible senior notes due 2015 

inputs to valuation techniques are observable or unobservable observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources while unobservable inputs reflect our market assumptions these two types of inputs have created the following fair value hierarchy 

 this hierarchy requires us to minimize the use of unobservable inputs and to use observable market data if available when determining fair value we recognize transfers between levels of this hierarchy based on the fair values of the respective financial instruments at the end of the reporting period in which the transfer occurred 

the types of instruments that trade in markets that are not considered to be active but are valued based on quoted market prices broker or dealer quotations or alternative pricing sources with reasonable levels of price transparency are generally classified within level 2 of the fair value hierarchy 

certain instruments are classified within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy because they trade infrequently and therefore have little or no price transparency for those instruments that are not traded in active markets or are subject to transfer restrictions valuations are adjusted to reflect illiquidity andor nontransferability and such adjustments are generally based on available market evidence in the absence of such evidence our best estimate is used 

while we believe the observable inputs we use to measure the assets and liabilities included in level 2 and the unobservable inputs we use to measure the assets and liabilities included in level 3 are reasonable different inputs or estimates may materially impact the resulting fair value measurements of these instruments and may also impact our results of operations for an additional description of our fair value measurements see note 8 in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

results of operations 

financial results for fiscal 2013  as compared to fiscal 2012  and 2011  reflect the following 

 

our fiscal year ends on the saturday closest to december 31 fiscal 2013 2012 and 2011 were 52week years while fiscal 2014 will be a 53week year which will impact revenue and expenses during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 

revenue 

we primarily generate revenue from licensing our software and ip selling or leasing our emulation hardware technology providing maintenance for our software hardware and ip providing engineering services and earning royalties generated from the use of our ip the timing of our revenue is significantly affected by the mix of software hardware and ip products in the bookings executed in any given period and whether the revenue for such bookings is recognized over multiple periods or up front upon completion of delivery 

we seek to achieve a consistent mix of bookings with approximately 90 of the aggregate value of our bookings of a type for which the revenue is recurring in nature and the remainder of the resulting revenue recognized upfront upon completion of delivery our ability to achieve this bookings mix in any single fiscal period may be impacted primarily by hardware sales because revenue for hardware sales is generally recognized up front in the period in which delivery is completed 

approximately 90  of the aggregate value of our bookings during fiscal 2013  2012  and 2011  was of a type for which the revenue is recurring in nature 

 we believe our reported revenue and the amount of revenue recognized in future periods will depend on among other things the 

 30 

revenue mix 

we have formulated a design solution strategy that combines our design technologies including our software hardware and ip offerings into various product categories as described below 

functional verification including emulation hardware and ip  products in this group including the incisive functional verification platform are used to verify that the highlevel logical representation of an ic design is functionally correct and for verification at the system and soc levels our emulation hardware products vip products memory subsystem models and design ip products are also included in this product group revenue related to our fiscal 2013 acquisitions is included in this product group 

custom ic design  our custom design products including the virtuoso custom design platform are used to create ics that must be designed at the transistor level including analog mixed signal custom digital memory and rf designs included in this group are specialized verification products that simulate the operation of the design prior to manufacturing 

digital ic design and signoff  products in this group including the encounter digital ic design platform are used to create and verify designs in conjunction with our functional verification capabilities create a physical representation of logic models and ultimately produce the detailed design information describing how the ic will be manufactured the final product of the design flow is a file that describes the various photomasks which are used to manufacture the ic 

system interconnect design  this product group consists of our pcb and ic package design products including the allegro and orcad products the allegro system interconnect design platform enables consistent codesign of interconnects across ics ic packages and pcbs while the orcad line focuses on costeffective entrylevel pcb solutions 

design for manufacturing  included in the dfm product group are our physical verification manufacturing optimization and layout analysis products these products are used to analyze optimize and verify that the physical blueprint of the ic has been constructed correctly and can be manufactured successfully while our primary focus in dfm is to address manufacturing effects in the upstream digital and custom design flows those products included in this dfm category also are offered separately from our other tools 

for an additional description of our current product strategy see the discussion under the heading products and product strategy under part i item 1 business 

revenue by year 

during fiscal 2013 we combined product and maintenance revenue into a single caption on the consolidated income statements because product and maintenance revenue is generally recognized from agreements that require customers to purchase both the product and associated maintenance in a bundled offering we reclassified prior period product and maintenance revenue balances to conform to the current year presentation 

the following table shows our revenue for fiscal 2013  2012  and 2011  and the change in revenue between years 



product and maintenance revenue increased during fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 primarily because of increased business levels increased revenue recognized from bookings in prior periods and incremental revenue recognized from our fiscal 2013 and 2012 acquisitions services revenue decreased during fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 primarily because of the redeployment primarily during fiscal 2012 of certain of our design services engineers to internal research and development projects related to our design ip activities 

product and maintenance revenue increased during fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 primarily because of increased business levels an increase in revenue related to the sale and lease of our hardware products and increased revenue recognized from bookings in prior periods services revenue decreased during fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 primarily because certain of our design services engineers were redeployed to internal research and development projects and to assist with presales activities 

while the macroenvironment remains challenging we expect product and maintenance revenue will increase during fiscal 2014 due to increases in revenue from our software and ip products 

no one customer accounted for 10  or more of total revenue during fiscal 2013  2012  or 2011  

revenue by product group 

the following table shows the percentage of product and related maintenance revenue contributed by each of our five product groups and services during fiscal 2013  2012  and 2011  



as described in note 2 in the notes to consolidated financial statements certain of our licensing arrangements allow customers the ability to remix among software products additionally we have arrangements with customers that include a combination of our products with the actual product selection and number of licensed users to be determined at a later date for these arrangements we estimate the allocation of the revenue to product groups based upon the expected usage of our products the actual usage of our products by these customers may differ and if that proves to be the case the revenue allocation in the table above would differ 

the changes in the percentage of revenue contributed by the custom ic design product group for the years presented are primarily related to increased business levels during fiscal 2013 

revenue by geography 



most of our revenue is transacted in the united states dollar however certain revenue transactions are denominated in foreign currencies primarily the japanese yen and we recognize reduced revenue from those contracts in periods when the japanese yen weakens in value against the united states dollar and additional revenue from those contracts in periods when the japanese yen strengthens against the united states dollar revenue for japan was impacted by a weaker japanese yen during fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 for an additional description of how changes in foreign exchange rates affect our consolidated financial statements see the discussion in item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk – foreign currency risk 

revenue for japan decreased during fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 primarily due to business conditions facing our japanese customers and the weaker japanese yen for the primary factors contributing to our increase in revenue in other geographies see the general description under revenue by year above 

revenue by geography as a percent of total revenue 



cost of revenue 

  

the following table shows cost of revenue as a percentage of related revenue for fiscal 2013  2012  and 2011  

  



cost of product and maintenance 

cost of product and maintenance includes costs associated with the sale and lease of our hardware and licensing of our software and ip products certain employee salary benefits and other employeerelated costs cost of our customer support services amortization of technologyrelated and maintenancerelated acquired intangibles as well as the costs of technical documentation and royalties payable to thirdparty vendors costs associated with our hardware products include materials assembly and overhead these additional hardware manufacturing costs make our cost of hardware product higher as a percentage of revenue than our cost of software and ip products 

a summary of cost of product and maintenance for fiscal 2013  2012  and 2011  is as follows 

  

  

cost of product and maintenance depends primarily upon hardware product sales in any given period employee salary benefits and other employeerelated costs and also upon the timing and extent to which we acquire intangible assets acquire or license thirdparties intellectual property or technology and sell our products that include such acquired or licensed intellectual property or technology 

the changes in product and maintenancerelated costs were due to the following 



hardware costs increased during fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 due to a higher volume of hardware products sold profit margins can fluctuate from period to period depending upon among other things the mix of software hardware and ip revenue and the cost of product associated with particular sales agreements profit margins on our hardware products may fluctuate based on customer pricing strategies product competition and product life cycle profit margins on our hardware products decreased during fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 we expect lower profit margins on the sale of our hardware products during fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 primarily because our emulation hardware products will be in the fourth year of their product life cycle 

salary benefits and other employeerelated costs decreased during fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 primarily due to redeployment of certain customer support employees to sales support roles 

amortization of acquired intangibles included in cost of product and maintenance increased during fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 and during fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 primarily due to the increase in amortization of intangible assets associated with our fiscal 2013 and 2012 acquisitions we expect amortization of acquired intangibles to increase for fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 primarily due to amortization of intangible assets recorded in connection with our fiscal 2013 acquisitions for an additional description of our expected amortization of intangible assets see note 5 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

cost of services 

cost of services primarily includes employee salary benefits and other employeerelated costs costs to maintain the infrastructure necessary to manage a services organization and provisions for contract losses if any the decrease of 46 million  in cost of services during fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 was primarily due to lower variable compensation and a decrease in the use of consulting services 

cost of services decreased by 89 million  during fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 primarily due to a decrease in employee salary benefits and other employeerelated costs certain of our design services engineers were redeployed to internal research and development projects or to assist with presales activities resulting in lower cost of services expense 

operating expenses 

our operating expenses include marketing and sales research and development and general and administrative expenses factors that may cause our operating expenses to fluctuate include changes in the number of employees due to hiring and acquisitions foreign exchange rates and the impact of our variable compensation programs that are driven by overall operating results 

our employee salary and other compensationrelated costs increased during fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 and during fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 primarily due to incremental costs related to employees added from our fiscal 2013 and 2012 acquisitions and hiring additional employees for our research and development and sales activities 

we expect our operating expenses to generally increase during fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 primarily because fiscal 2014 will include a full year of operating expenses for additional employees added through our fiscal 2013 acquisitions fiscal 2013 hiring of research and development and sales personnel and due to expected hiring during fiscal 2014 

many of our operating expenses are transacted in various foreign currencies we recognize lower expenses in periods when the united states dollar strengthens in value against other currencies and we recognize higher expenses when the united states dollar weakens against other currencies for an additional description of how changes in foreign exchange rates affect our consolidated financial statements see the discussion in item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk – foreign currency risk 

our operating expenses for fiscal 2013  2012  and 2011  were as follows 



our operating expenses as a percentage of total revenue for fiscal 2013  2012  and 2011  were as follows 



  

marketing and sales 

the changes in marketing and sales expense were due to the following 



the increase in salary benefits and other employeerelated costs during fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 is primarily due to the addition of employees from our fiscal 2013 and 2012 acquisitions and hiring of sales and marketing personnel 

research and development 

  the changes in research and development expense were due to the following 



the increase in salary benefits and other employeerelated costs during fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 was primarily due to incremental costs related to employees added from our fiscal 2013 and 2012 acquisitions and hiring of research and development personnel our research and development expense also increased during fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 due to an increase in facilities and other infrastructure costs to accommodate additional employees 

the increase in salary benefits and other employeerelated costs during fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 is primarily due to hiring additional employees for our research and development activities the addition of employees through our fiscal 2012 acquisition costs associated with design services engineers redeployed to internal research and development projects and higher variable compensation resulting from improved business levels our research and development expense also increased during fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 due to an increase in professional engineering services costs related to the continuing development of our products and technologies 

general and administrative 

the changes in general and administrative expense were due to the following 



general and administrative expense for fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 increased primarily due to an increase in professional services costs resulting from services rendered in connection with our fiscal 2013 acquisitions and an increase in salary benefits and other employeerelated costs resulting from additional employees added from our fiscal 2013 and 2012 acquisitions 

we recorded net recoveries of our allowance for doubtful accounts of 66 million during fiscal 2011 because we collected certain receivables that previously had been included in our allowance for doubtful accounts these recoveries resulted in reductions in our general and administrative expense during fiscal 2011 and as a result our general and administrative expense increased for fiscal 2012 we had previously recorded reserves for certain customers based on our assessment of collectibility for those customers the principal factor for the assessment at that time was a general deterioration of economic conditions having a significant impact on certain customers these customers business prospects eventually improved and we were able to collect the majority of those receivables that had previously been reserved resulting in recoveries of previously reserved bad debts 

stockbased compensation 

stockbased compensation expense is recorded within the various components of our costs and expenses stockbased compensation expense increased 187 million  during fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 because of an increase in restricted stock outstanding higher grantdate fair values and the assumption of certain unvested options related to one of our fiscal 2013 acquisitions stockbased compensation expense increased 40 million  during fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 because of an increase in restricted stock outstanding and higher grant date fair values 

we expect stockbased compensation to increase during fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 because we expect that new awards granted during fiscal 2014 will have higher grant date fair values compared to grants made in previous years and because expenses recorded for awards vesting during fiscal 2014 originate primarily from stock awards granted in recent years which generally have higher grant date fair values than awards that vested during fiscal 2013 

amortization of acquired intangibles 



the changes in amortization of acquired intangibles were due to the following 



we expect amortization of acquired intangibles to increase during fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 as a result of intangible assets acquired in connection with our fiscal 2013 acquisitions 

restructuring and other charges 

we have initiated various restructuring plans with the most recent taking place during fiscal 2013 to better align our resources with our business strategy for an additional description of these restructuring plans see note 12 in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

because the restructuring charges and related benefits are derived from managements estimates made during the formulation of the restructuring plans based on thencurrently available information our restructuring plans may not achieve the benefits anticipated on the timetable or at the level contemplated demand for our products and services and ultimately our future financial performance is difficult to predict with any degree of certainty accordingly additional actions including further restructuring of our operations may be required in the future 

the following table presents restructuring and other charges credits for our restructuring plans 



restructuring and other charges recorded during fiscal 2013 consisted primarily of costs for severance and termination benefits related to our restructuring activities initiated during fiscal 2013 restructuring and other charges credits recorded during fiscal 2012 and 2011 consisted primarily of adjustments to previous estimates of restructuring liabilities 

interest expense 



we expect interest expense to decrease during fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 due to the repayment of our 2013 notes during december of fiscal 2013 

income taxes 

the following table presents the provision benefit for income taxes and the effective tax rate for fiscal 2013  2012  and 2011  



our benefit for income taxes for the fiscal year ended december 28 2013  primarily consisted of the following 

 which were partially offset by 

 the tax law that retroactively extended the united states federal research tax credit from january 1 2012 through december 31 2013 was enacted in january 2013 because the law was enacted during our fiscal 2013 we included the tax benefit of the fiscal 2012 federal research tax credit in our fiscal 2013 financial results 

our benefit for income taxes for fiscal 2012 primarily consisted of the following 

 which were partially offset by 

 our fiscal 2012 release of the valuation allowance was based on our determination that the magnitude and history of our united states income our achievement of a consistent multiyear history with approximately 90  of the aggregate value of our bookings being of a type for which revenue is recurring in nature and our ending backlog of future revenue for the year ended december 29 2012 provided us an objective source of future revenues that allowed us to more heavily weigh our projections of future income and collectively provided us with sufficient positive evidence that it is more likely than not that we will realize a significant amount of our united states deferred tax assets we maintained a valuation allowance of 743 million on certain of our deferred tax assets because the realization of these deferred tax assets require future income of a specific character or amount that we considered uncertain 

our fiscal 2011 provision for income taxes is primarily related to 114 million of tax expense on certain of our foreign subsidiaries 54 million of excess tax benefits from employee stock compensation that were allocated to stockholders equity and 41 million of interest expense on unrecognized tax benefits that was partially offset by 50 million of tax benefit from the release of valuation allowance due to the recognition of deferred tax liabilities resulting from a fiscal 2011 business combination 

the tax law that authorized the united states federal research tax credit expired on december 31 2013 unless a new tax law reinstates the federal research tax credit then we will not include the benefit of the federal research tax credit in our tax provision calculations for fiscal 2014 the fiscal 2013 federal research tax credit was approximately 69 million we expect to have a provision for income taxes in fiscal 2014 

for further discussion regarding our income taxes see note 6 in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

 liquidity and capital resources 



cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments 

as of december 28 2013  our principal sources of liquidity consisted of 6330 million  of cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments as compared to 8271 million  as of december 29 2012  

during fiscal 2013  we used 3928 million  of our cash and cash equivalents for our fiscal 2013 acquisitions we used an additional 1446 million  of our cash and cash equivalents to pay the remaining balance of the 2013 notes and the 2023 notes these uses of cash and cash equivalents partially offset by 3676 million  of cash generated from our operating activities resulted in a decrease in our cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments balance as of december 28 2013  as compared to december 29 2012  during fiscal 2013  we used the cash generated from our operating activities and utilized our revolving credit facility to meet our working capital requirements and to maintain adequate liquidity 

our primary sources of cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments during fiscal 2013  and 2012  were customer payments for products maintenance and services and during fiscal 2013 borrowings under our revolving credit facility we also received cash from stock purchases under our espp and from the exercise of stock options 

our primary uses of cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments during fiscal 2013  and 2012  were payments relating to our fiscal 2013 and 2012 acquisitions salaries benefits other employeerelated costs and other operating expenses during fiscal 2013  we also used cash to pay the remaining balance of the 2013 notes the 2023 notes and for payments of borrowings under our revolving credit facility 

approximately 70  of our cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments were held by our foreign subsidiaries as of december 28 2013  our intent is to permanently reinvest our earnings from certain foreign operations we do not anticipate we will need to repatriate dividends from foreign operations that are permanently reinvested in order to fund our domestic operations in the event that dividends from foreign operations that are currently permanently reinvested are needed to fund united states liquidity we could be required to accrue and pay additional taxes in order to repatriate these funds for further discussion regarding our income taxes including the unrecognized tax liability for indefinitely reinvested foreign earnings see note 6 in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

during fiscal 2012 we began to maintain an investment portfolio of approximately 100 million in marketable debt securities including corporate debt securities united states treasury securities united states government agency securities bank certificates of deposit and commercial paper our investments in marketable debt securities are classified as availableforsale and are included in shortterm investments as of december 28 2013  our investments are made in accordance with our cash investment policy which governs the amounts and types of investments we hold in our portfolio our investment portfolio could be affected by various risks and uncertainties including credit risk interest rate risk and general market risk as outlined in part i item 1a risk factors 

during fiscal 2012 we also entered into a 250 million fiveyear senior secured revolving credit facility borrowings under the credit facility may be used to finance working capital capital expenditures acquisitions and other business purposes any outstanding loans drawn under the credit facility are payable on or before december 12 2017 the credit facility contains customary negative covenants that among other things restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness grant liens and make certain investments asset dispositions and restricted payments in addition the credit facility contains certain financial covenants that require us to maintain a leverage ratio of not greater than 3 to 1 subject to certain exceptions and requires that we maintain an interest coverage ratio of at least 3 to 1 for an additional description of this revolving credit facility see note 3 in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

we expect that current cash cash equivalents and shortterm investment balances cash flows that are generated from operations and cash borrowings available under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to meet our domestic and international working capital needs and other capital and liquidity requirements including acquisitions and share repurchases if any for at least the next 12 months 

net working capital 

the changes in net working capital were due to the following   



the increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities is primarily due to the timing of payments to our vendors and an increase in accrued salary benefits and other employeerelated costs resulting from employees added from our fiscal 2013 and 2012 acquisitions the decrease in convertible notes relates to the payment of our 2013 notes and 2023 notes during fiscal 2013 

cash flows from operating activities 

cash flows from operating activities during fiscal 2013  2012  and 2011  were as follows 



the changes in cash flows from operating activities were due to the following 



cash flows from operating activities include net income adjusted for certain noncash items as well as changes in the balances of certain assets and liabilities our cash flows from operating activities are significantly influenced by business levels and the payment terms set forth in our license agreements 

if our customers experience adverse changes in the future are not successful in generating sufficient cash or are precluded from securing financing they may delay purchasing our products and services or they may not be able to pay or may delay payment of accounts receivable that are owed to us although these obligations are generally not cancelable our customers inability to fulfill payment obligations would adversely affect our cash flow additionally our customers may seek to renegotiate preexisting contractual commitments though we have not experienced a material level of defaults any material payment default by our customers or significant reductions in existing contractual commitments would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and cash flows from operations 

we expect to pay an additional 142 million  related to our previous restructuring activities primarily for payments related to accrued severance and termination benefits 

we expect that cash flows from operating activities will fluctuate in future periods due to a number of factors including our operating results tax payments and the timing of our billings collections and disbursements 

cash flows from investing activities 

cash flows from investing activities during fiscal 2013  2012  and 2011  were as follows 



the changes in cash flows from investing activities were due to the following 



cash paid in business combinations and asset acquisitions relates to our fiscal 2013 and 2012 acquisitions for an additional description of the acquisitions completed during fiscal 2013  and 2012  see note 4 in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

during fiscal 2012 we began to maintain an investment portfolio of approximately 100 million in marketable debt securities the proceeds from purchases of and maturities of availableforsale securities are primarily related to normal purchases sales and maturities of the debt securities included in this investment portfolio 

we expect to continue our investing activities including purchasing property plant and equipment purchasing intangible assets business combinations purchasing software licenses and making longterm equity investments 

cash flows from financing activities 

cash flows from financing activities during fiscal 2013  2012  and 2011  were as follows 



the changes in cash flows from financing activities were due to the following 



during fiscal 2013 we paid a total of 1446 million  to retire the remaining principal balance of the 2013 notes and the 2023 notes borrowings under the revolving credit facility were used for general working capital purposes and were repaid during fiscal 2013 for an additional description of our convertible notes the conversion terms thereof and a description of our revolving credit facility see note 3 in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

cash inflows from the issuance of common stock and the tax effect related to employee stock transactions allocated to equity increased during fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 primarily as a result of an increase in the exercise of stock options this was partially offset by an increase in cash outflows related to stock received for payment of employee taxes on vesting of restricted stock 

we expect to repurchase 500 million of our common stock during fiscal 2014 and we may repurchase additional shares of our common stock in fiscal 2015 for an additional description of our share repurchase programs and repurchase authorizations see part ii item 5 market for registrants common equity related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities and note 18 in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

other factors affecting liquidity and capital resources 

convertible notes 

as of december 28 2013  we had convertible notes outstanding with a net liability value of 3248 million  that mature on june 1 2015 the principal maturity value of our 2015 notes is 3500 million  the total cash payable upon the early conversion of these notes as determined by the indenture of each security will be their principal amount plus any additional conversion value that would be due upon conversion 

we will owe additional cash to the note holders upon early conversion if our stock price exceeds 755 per share we entered into hedges with counterparties to limit our exposure to the additional cash payments above the principal amount of the 2015 notes that may be due to the holders upon conversion in separate transactions we sold warrants or the 2015 warrants with a strike price of 1078  per share although our incremental cash payout exposure above the conversion price is limited by the hedges to the 3500 million  outstanding principal value of the 2015 notes we will experience dilution to our stock and to our diluted earnings per share from the outstanding 2015 warrants to the extent our average closing stock price exceeds 1078  in any fiscal quarter until the 2015 notes are converted and the 2015 warrants are settled 

additionally holders may convert their 2015 notes into cash during any quarter following a quarter in which our stock price closes above 981  for at least 20  of the last 30  trading days the 2015 notes are convertible into cash from december 29 2013  through march 29 2014  because our closing stock price exceeded 981  for at least 20  of the last 30  trading days prior to december 28 2013  accordingly the net balance of the 2015 notes of 3248 million  is classified as a current liability on our consolidated balance sheet as of december 28 2013  while holders of the 2015 notes would have the right to convert their notes if early conversion conditions are met we do not expect holders of the 2015 notes to convert their notes under such circumstances because the economic value to the holders of the notes has exceeded and likely will continue to exceed the cash received upon conversion if the holders of our 2015 notes elect to convert their notes into cash we would be required to make cash payments of up to 3500 million  prior to the maturity of the 2015 notes 

in connection with the 2015 notes we entered into the 2015 notes hedges and sold warrants to limit our exposure to the additional cash payments above the 3500 million  principal balance in the event of a cash conversion of the 2015 notes the 2015 notes currently trade at a premium to their ifconverted value and we do not anticipate a conversion of the 2015 notes by the note holders between december 29 2013  and march 29 2014  

we believe that cash generated from our operating activities in future periods as well as access to our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to service the maturity or conversion of our 2015 notes but future changes in our cash position cash flows from operating activities cash flows from investing activities cash flows from financing activities as well as general business levels and changes in our access to financing may impact our ability to settle the principal amount payable to the holders of the 2015 notes when they mature or convert 

for an additional description of the 2015 notes the conversion terms thereof and the hedge and warrants transactions see note 3 in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

acquisitionrelated contingent consideration 

in connection with our business combinations and asset acquisitions completed before december 31 2011  we may be obligated to make payments based on or subject to the satisfaction of certain performance metrics if performance is such that these payments are fully achieved we are obligated to pay up to an aggregate of 143 million  in cash during the next 28  months 

contractual obligations 

a summary of our contractual obligations as of december 28 2013  is as follows 



 

1 with respect to purchase obligations that are cancelable by us the table includes the amount that would have been payable if we had canceled the obligation as of december 28 2013  or the earliest cancellation date 

2 holders of the 2015 notes can convert their 2015 notes into cash during a fiscal quarter if the closing price of our common stock exceeds 981 for at least 20 days in the 30 day period preceding the end of the preceding fiscal quarter this conversion condition was met for the 2015 notes during the three months ended december 28 2013  and the 2015 notes are convertible into cash from december 29 2013  through march 29 2014  accordingly we classified the net balance of the 2015 notes of 3248 million  as a current liability on our consolidated balance sheet as of december 28 2013  contractual interest payments associated with the 2015 notes are presented assuming the outstanding balance will be paid infull on the contractual maturity date in connection with the 2015 notes we entered into the 2015 notes hedges and sold warrants to limit our exposure to the additional cash payments above the 3500 million principal balance in the event of a cash conversion of the 2015 notes the 2015 notes currently trade at a premium to their ifconverted value so we do not anticipate a conversion of the 2015 notes by the note holders between december 29 2013  and march 29 2014  

3 included in other longterm contractual obligations are longterm income tax liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits of 114 million  that we estimate will be paid or settled within 1 to 3 years the remaining portion of other longterm contractual obligations is primarily liabilities associated with defined benefit retirement plans and acquisitionrelated liabilities 

in connection with our acquisitions completed before december 28 2013  we are obligated to pay up to an aggregate of 143 million  in cash over the next 28  months if certain defined performance goals are achieved in full 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

as of december 28 2013  we did not have any significant offbalance sheet arrangements as defined in item 303a4ii of sec regulation sk 

new accounting standards 

in june 2013 the fasb issued new accounting standards clarifying the characteristics of investment companies and set forth a new approach for determining whether a company is an investment company the updated standard requires entities with an ownership interest in an investment company to use the investment companys accounting standards to measure the value of its interest in the investment company these standards are applicable to our investments currently accounted for using the equity method and will be effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december 15 2013 they are not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated operating results or financial position 

in july 2013 the fasb issued new accounting standards requiring the netting of unrecognized tax benefits against a deferred tax asset for a net operating loss carryforward a similar tax loss or a tax credit carryforward except in certain circumstances when those circumstances exist the unrecognized tax benefit should be presented in the financial statements as a liability and should not be combined with deferred tax assets these standards are effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after december 15 2013 these standards were to be applied prospectively to all unrecognized tax benefits that exist at the effective date the adoption of the new guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

we periodically review new accounting standards although some of the accounting standards that have been issued may be applicable to us we have not identified any other new accounting standards that would have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

foreign currency risk 

a material portion of our revenue expenses and business activity are transacted in the united states dollar however certain of our operations include transactions in foreign currencies that can affect our results of operations in certain countries where we invoice customers in the local currency japan in particular our revenues benefit from a weaker dollar and are adversely affected by a stronger dollar the opposite impact occurs in countries where we record expenses in local currencies in those cases our operating expenses benefit from a stronger dollar and are adversely affected by a weaker dollar the fluctuations in our operating expenses outside the united states resulting from volatility in the united states dollar against certain foreign currencies are not generally moderated by corresponding fluctuations in our revenues except for our operations in japan because we receive some cash payments and make most expense payments in japanese yen 

we enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts with financial institutions to protect against currency exchange risks associated with existing assets and liabilities a foreign currency forward exchange contract acts as a hedge by increasing in value when underlying assets decrease in value or underlying liabilities increase in value due to changes in foreign exchange rates conversely a foreign currency forward exchange contract decreases in value when underlying assets increase in value or underlying liabilities decrease in value due to changes in foreign exchange rates these forward contracts are not designated as accounting hedges so the unrealized gains and losses are recognized in other income net in advance of the actual foreign currency cash flows with the fair value of these forward contracts being recorded as accrued liabilities or other current assets 

we do not use forward contracts for trading purposes our forward contracts generally have maturities of 90 days or less we enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts based on estimated future asset and liability exposures and the effectiveness of our hedging program depends on our ability to estimate these future asset and liability exposures recognized gains and losses with respect to our current hedging activities will ultimately depend on how accurately we are able to match the amount of foreign currency forward exchange contracts with actual underlying asset and liability exposures 

the following table provides information about our foreign currency forward exchange contracts as of december 28 2013  the information is provided in united states dollar equivalent amounts the table presents the notional amounts at contract exchange rates and the weighted average contractual foreign currency exchange rates expressed as units of the foreign currency per united states dollar which in some cases may not be the market convention for quoting a particular currency all of these forward contracts mature before or during february 2014    



while we actively monitor our foreign currency risks there can be no assurance that our foreign currency hedging activities will substantially offset the impact of fluctuations in currency exchange rates on our results of operations cash flows and financial position 

interest rate risk 

our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our portfolio of marketable debt securities our portfolio of cash and cash equivalents and outstanding balances drawn on our revolving credit facility if any 

 we are exposed to interest rate fluctuations in many of the worlds leading industrialized countries but the fair value of our marketable debt securities and our interest income and expense is most sensitive to fluctuations in the general level of united states interest rates in this regard changes in united states interest rates affect the interest earned on our marketable debt securities and cash and cash equivalents any unrealized and realized gains or losses on our marketable debt securities and the costs associated with foreign currency hedges pursuant to our investment policy we limit the amount of our credit exposure to any one issuer other than in securities issued by the united states treasury and united states government agencies 

our shortterm investments as of december 28 2013  include 947 million  of marketable debt securities that may decline in value if market interest rates rise such variability in market interest rates may result in a negative impact on the results of our investment activities as of december 28 2013  an increase in the market rates of interest of 1 would result in a decrease in the fair values of our marketable debt securities by approximately 07 million  

all highly liquid securities with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase are considered to be cash equivalents securities with maturities greater than three months are classified as availableforsale and are considered to be shortterm investments the carrying value of our interestbearing instruments approximated fair value as of december 28 2013  

interest rates under our revolving credit facility are variable so interest expense for periods when the credit facility is utilized could be adversely affected by changes in interest rates interest rates under our revolving credit facility can fluctuate based on changes in market interest rates and in an interest rate margin that varies based on our consolidated leverage ratio as of december 28 2013  we had no  outstanding balance on the revolving credit facility for additional description of this revolving credit facility see note 3 in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

equity price risk 

convertible notes 

our 2015 notes include conversion and settlement provisions that are based on the price of our common stock at conversion or at maturity of the notes in addition the hedges and warrants associated with these convertible notes also include settlement provisions that are based on the price of our common stock the amount of cash we may be required to pay or the number of shares we may be required to provide to note holders at conversion or maturity of these notes is determined by the price of our common stock the amount of cash or number of shares that we may receive from hedge counterparties in connection with the related hedges and the number of shares that we may be required to provide warrant counterparties in connection with the related warrants are also determined by the price of our common stock 

upon the expiration of our 2015 warrants cadence will issue shares of common stock to the purchasers of the warrants to the extent our stock price exceeds the warrant strike price of 1078  at that time the following table shows the number of shares that cadence would issue to 2015 warrant counterparties at expiration of the warrants assuming various cadence closing stock prices on the dates of warrant expiration 

  

prior to the expiration of the 2015 warrants for purposes of calculating diluted earnings per share our diluted weightedaverage shares outstanding will increase when our average closing stock price for a quarter exceeds 1078  

for an additional description of our 2015 notes see note 3 in the notes to consolidated financial statements and liquidity and capital resources – other factors affecting liquidity and capital resources under item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

equity investments 

we have a portfolio of equity investments that includes marketable equity securities and nonmarketable investments our equity investments are made primarily in connection with our strategic investment program under our strategic investment program from time to time we make cash investments in companies with technologies that are potentially strategically important to us see note 9 in the notes to consolidated financial statements for an additional description of these investments our nonmarketable investments had a carrying value of 67 million  as of december 28 2013  and 73 million  as of december 29 2012

none 




 item 9a controls and procedures 

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

as required by rule 13a15 of the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended or the exchange act under the supervision and with the participation of our management including our chief executive officer or ceo and our chief financial officer or cfo we evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rules 13a15e and 15d15e under the exchange act as of december 28 2013  

the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures included a review of our processes and the effect on the information generated for use in this annual report on form 10k in the course of this evaluation we sought to identify any material weaknesses in our disclosure controls and procedures to determine whether we had identified any acts of fraud involving personnel who have a significant role in our disclosure controls and procedures and to confirm that any necessary corrective action including process improvements was taken this type of evaluation is done every fiscal quarter so that our conclusions concerning the effectiveness of these controls can be reported in our periodic reports filed with the sec the overall goals of these evaluation activities are to monitor our disclosure controls and procedures and to make modifications as necessary we intend to maintain these disclosure controls and procedures modifying them as circumstances warrant 

based on their evaluation as of december 28 2013  our ceo and cfo have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by us in our reports filed or submitted under the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the secs rules and forms and is accumulated and communicated to our management including the ceo and cfo as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure 

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the fiscal quarter ended december 28 2013  that materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting 

inherent limitations on effectiveness of controls 

our management including our ceo and cfo does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud internal control over financial reporting no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of internal control are met further the design of internal control must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of the control must be considered relative to their costs while our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance of their effectiveness because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within cadence have been detected 

managements report on internal control over financial reporting 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rule 13a15f under the exchange act our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 28 2013  in making this assessment our management used the criteria established in internal controlintegrated framework 1992 issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission our management has concluded that as of december 28 2013  our internal control over financial reporting is effective based on these criteria our independent registered public accounting firm kpmg llp has issued an attestation report on our internal control over financial reporting which is included in part iv item 15 exhibits and financial statement schedules

the electronic design automation industry and our business 

the electronic design automation or eda industry including our business is driven by our customers response to enduser demand for electronic devices that are smaller use less power and provide more functionality to meet this demand our customers design and develop new ics and electronic devices using our products and services accordingly our business depends on our customers continued investment in new designs and products 

the markets our customers serve are sensitive to product price and the time it takes to bring the products to market in order to be competitive and profitable in these markets our customers demand high levels of productivity from their design teams better predictability in shorter development schedules high quality products and lower development costs semiconductor and electronics systems companies are responding to these challenges and users demand for increased functionality and smaller devices by 

combining subsystems  such as radio frequency or rf wireless communication signal processing microprocessors and memory controllers  onto a single silicon chip creating a systemonchip or soc or combining multiple chips into a single chip package in a format referred to as systeminpackage or sip the trend toward subsystem integration has required these chip makers to find solutions to challenges previously addressed by system companies such as verifying systemlevel functionality and hardwaresoftware interoperability 

our offerings address many of the challenges associated with developing unique silicon circuitry integrating that circuitry with design ip developed by us or third parties to create socs and combining ics and socs with software to create electronic systems our strategy is to provide our customers with the ability to address the broad range of issues that arise at the silicon soc and system levels 

significant issues that our customers face in creating their products include optimizing energy consumption manufacturing microscopic circuitry verifying device functionality and achieving technical performance targets all while meeting aggressive timetomarket and cost requirements providers of eda solutions must deliver products that address these technical challenges while improving the productivity predictability reliability and profitability of the design processes and products of their customers

our simulation acceleration and emulation products either on their secure intranet site or remotely over a highspeed secure network connection 

our design ip offerings consist of preverified functional blocks which customers integrate into their socs to accelerate the development process and to reduce the risk of errors in the design process cadence offers many types of design ip including controllers and physical interfaces or phys for standard protocols such as ethernet peripheral component interconnect express or pci express dynamic ram and flash memory controllers cadence also offers a very broad range of vip and memory models which model the expected behavior of many industry standard protocols when used with verification solutions and are complementary to our design ip offerings 

custom ic design 

custom ic design and verification offerings are used by our customers to create schematic and physical representations of circuits down to the transistor level for analog mixedsignal custom digital memory and rf designs these representations are verified using simulation tools optimized for each type of design the offering includes the environment simulation and ic layout capabilities within the virtuoso custom design platform other tools in the custom ic portfolio are used to prepare the designs for manufacturing 

digital ic design 

digital ic design offerings are used by our customers to create logical representations of a digital circuit or an ic that can be verified for correctness prior to implementation see the discussion under the functional verification hardware and ip section above once the logic is verified the design representation is implemented or converted to a format ready for silicon manufacturing using additional software tools within this category the manufacturing representation is also analyzed and verified see the discussion under the design for manufacturing section below our digital ic offerings include two major categories logic design and physical implementation 

our logic design offering is comprised of logic synthesis test and equivalence checking capabilities within the encounter digital ic design platform and is typically used by customers to create and verify designs in conjunction with our functional verification capabilities this offering provides chip planning design verification and test technologies and services to customers logic design capabilities are aggregated into solutions that address our customers needs in areas such as low power and mixed signal designs 

our physical implementation offering is included in the encounter digital ic design platform this offering is comprised of tools used near the end of the design process including place and route timing analysis signal integrity power analysis extraction and physical verification capabilities this offering enables customers to create a physical representation of logic models analyze electrical and physical characteristics of a design and prepare a design for manufacturing we have enhanced this offering to enable customers to address the technology challenges of the latest semiconductor advanced process nodes 

system interconnect design 

our system interconnect design offerings are used by our customers to develop printed circuit boards or pcbs and ic packages the offerings include the following capabilities within the allegro system interconnect design platform pcb authoring and implementation ic package  sip signal and power integrity analysis pcb library design management and collaboration certain offerings also include the simulation capability within the virtuoso custom design platform advanced analysis tools were added through the acquisition of sigrity inc or sigrity during fiscal 2012 sigrity tm  analysis tools have been integrated with our allegro platform enabling a comprehensive fronttoback flow for implementation and full signal and power integrity analysis for designs featuring high speed interface protocols these offerings enable engineers who are responsible for the capture layout and analysis of advanced pcb and ic packages to design highperformance electronic products across the domains of ic ic package and pcb to increase functional density and to manage design complexity while reducing cost and timetomarket the need for compact high performance mobile design with advanced serial interconnect is driving renewed growth and technology evolution for our pcb offering for the mainstream pcb customers where individual or small team productivity is a focus we provide the orcad ®  family of offerings that is marketed worldwide through a network of resellers 

design for manufacturing 

with the advent of silicon manufacturing technologies at advanced process nodes our customers are concerned with the manufacturability and yield of their designs the physical layout of each ic requires detailed analysis and optimization to ensure 

that the design can be manufactured in volume while performing as expected some of our dfm capabilities include electrical and physical lithography checking chemicalmechanical polishing analysis and optimization pattern matching double patterning and optical proximity checking 

our primary focus in dfm is to address manufacturing effects as early in the product development process as possible as a result we have enhanced the dfm awareness of our core encounter digital ic and virtuoso custom ic product offerings in addition to upstream integration of dfm technologies we also offer standalone dfm products 

thirdparty programs and initiatives 

in addition to our products many customers use design tools that are provided by other eda companies as well as design ip available from multiple suppliers we support the use of thirdparty design products and design ip through vehicles such as our connections ®  program and through our participation in industry groups such as the silicon integration initiative and accellera system initiative we actively contribute to the development and deployment of eda industry standards 

technical support and maintenance 

customer service and support is critical to the adoption and successful use of our products we provide our customers with technical support and maintenance to facilitate their use of our software ip and hardware solutions 

services 

we offer a number of feebased services including engineering methodology education and hosted design solutions these services may be sold separately or sold and performed in conjunction with the sale lease or license of our products during fiscal 2012 certain of our design services engineers were redeployed to internal research and development projects associated with our design ip business or to assist with presales activities and we expect to continue deploying these design services engineers for similar activities in 2013 consequently design services revenue is expected to decline during fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 

as part of our services offerings we design advanced ics and address industry design issues that may not be solved adequately by todays eda technologies this enables us to target and accelerate the development of new software technology and products to satisfy current and future design requirements 

we offer engineering services to collaborate with our customers in the design of complex ics and the implementation of key design capabilities including low power design ic packaging and board design functional verification digital implementation analogmixedsignal design and systemlevel design the customers for these services primarily consist of semiconductor and systems companies developing products for the consumer communications military and aerospace and computing markets these ics range from digital socs analog and rf designs to complex mixedsignal ics 

in delivering methodology services we leverage our experience and knowledge of design techniques our products leading practices and different design environments to improve the productivity of our customers engineering teams depending on the customers projects and needs we work with customers using outsourcing consultative and collaborative offerings 

our hosted design solutions enable our engineering teams at one or more of our locations to assist our customers teams located elsewhere in the world during the course of their design and engineering projects through a secure network infrastructure they also enable us to deliver softwareasaservice to those customers who do not have their own infrastructure

product maintenance and services revenue 

revenue and revenue as a percentage of total revenue from our product services and maintenance offerings for the last three fiscal years were as follows 



  

for software arrangements we generally recognize revenue ratably over the duration of the arrangement and such revenue is allocated between product and maintenance revenue as the duration decreases the percentage of the total contract value that is allocated to maintenance revenue decreases and the percentage allocated to product revenue increases combined product and maintenance revenue increased during fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 maintenance revenue decreased on a standalone basis during fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 primarily because of the increased allocation to product revenue resulting from the decline in the average duration of our timebased software license arrangements for an additional description of our product services and maintenance revenue see the discussion under the heading results of operations under part ii item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

marketing and sales 

we generally market our products and provide services to existing and prospective customers through a direct sales force consisting of sales people and applications engineers applications engineers provide technical presales and postsales support for software products due to the complexity of many of our eda products and the electronic design process the sales cycle is generally long requiring three to six months or more during the sales cycle our direct sales force generally provides technical presentations product demonstrations and support for onsite customer evaluation of our solutions we also promote our products and services through advertising direct mail trade shows public relations and the internet we selectively utilize valueadded resellers to broaden our reach and reduce cost of sales all orcad and selected incisive products are primarily marketed through these channels with respect to international sales we generally market and support our products and services through our subsidiaries we also use a thirdparty distributor to sell our products and services to certain customers in japan 

product arrangements 

we license software using three license types term subscription and perpetual customers who prefer to license technology for a specified limited period of time will choose either a term or subscription license and customers who prefer to have the right to use the technology continuously without time restriction will choose a perpetual license customers who desire to use new software technology during the life of the contract will select a subscription license which allows them limited access to unspecified new technology on a whenandifavailable basis as opposed to a term or perpetual license which does not include the right to use new technology payment terms for term and subscription licenses generally provide for payments to be made in installments over the license period and payment terms for perpetual licenses generally are net 30 days 

our hardware products are either sold or leased to our customers 

we generally license our design ip under nonexclusive license agreements that provide usage rights for specific applications fees under these licenses are typically charged on a perdesign basis

our backlog was approximately  17 billion  as of both december 29 2012  and december 31 2011  our backlog as of december 29 2012  consisted of fully executed arrangements with effective dates commencing no later than december 29 2012  with revenue to be recognized thereafter and included a variety of license types generally including but not limited to 

 

the substantial majority of our backlog consists of customer contracts for which product and maintenance revenue is deferred and recognized ratably over the contract life historically we have not experienced significant cancellations of our contracts with customers for engineering services contracts in backlog completion dates are occasionally rescheduled delaying revenue recognition under those contracts beyond the original anticipated completion date changes in customer license types or payment terms also can affect the timing of revenue recognition during fiscal 2012 approximately 73  of our revenue came from backlog as of december 31 2011  we expect approximately 10 billion  or approximately 70  of our fiscal 2013 revenue to come from arrangements that were in backlog as of december 29 2012  the actual percentage of revenue coming from backlog during fiscal 2013 may change if our actual business levels in fiscal 2013 are different than our current expectations 

revenue seasonality 

as a result of our ratable revenue model our overall exposure to short term revenue seasonality has generally been reduced 

research and development 

our research and development expense was 4541 million  during fiscal 2012 4007 million  during fiscal 2011 and 3764 million  during fiscal 2010 

the primary areas of our research and development include the following 

 

our future performance depends largely on our ability to maintain and enhance our current product development and commercialization of newly developed products or capabilities and to offer solutions that meet increasingly demanding productivity quality predictability and cost requirements our offerings must keep pace with our customers technical developments including the adoption of advanced process nodes and industry standards 

manufacturing and software distribution 

we perform final assembly and testing of our hardware products at our headquarters in san jose california subcontractors manufacture all major subassemblies including all individual pcbs and custom ics and supply them for qualification and testing before their incorporation into the assembled product 

software and documentation are primarily distributed to customers by secure electronic delivery or on dvd 

proprietary technology 

our success depends in part upon our proprietary technology we generally rely on patents copyrights trademarks and trade secret laws licenses and restrictive agreements to establish and protect our proprietary rights in technology and products many of our products include software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties we may have to seek new licenses or renew existing licenses for thirdparty software and other intellectual property in the future as part of performing engineering services for customers our engineering services business uses certain software and other intellectual property licensed from third parties including that of our competitors 

competition 

we compete in eda software and hardware products most frequently with synopsys inc and mentor graphics corporation but also with numerous other eda providers such as ansys inc atrenta inc atoptech inc berkeley design automation inc and zuken ltd and many others offering point solutions with manufacturers of electronic devices that have developed acquired or have the capability to develop their own eda products and with numerous electronics design and consulting companies during fiscal 2012 synopsys acquired magma design automation inc eve sa and springsoft inc we expect that synopsys integration of these companies into its product offerings will result in increased competitive pressures in the area of design ip we compete with synopsys and numerous smaller ip companies we generally compete on the basis of quality product features level of integration or compatibility with other tools price and payment terms 

certain competitive factors in the engineering services business differ from those of the products businesses while we compete with other eda companies in the engineering services business our principal competitors include independent engineering service businesses these companies vary in focus geographic location capability cost structure and pricing business models of these companies range from servicesonly engineering work to delivery of completed ics many of these companies are also customers and therefore use our product offerings in the delivery of their services or products while we still compete with these companies by focusing on the design of complex analog digital and mixedsignal ics and socs we have moved certain of our design services engineers to our research and development activities to further enhance our growing portfolio of design ip and to improve our competitive position in that scalable business 

international operations 

we have 49  sales offices design centers and research and development facilities approximately 60  of which are located outside of the united states we consider customer sales and support requirements the availability of a skilled workforce and costs and efficiencies among other relative benefits when determining what operations to locate internationally for an additional description of our international operations see the discussion under the heading the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations may adversely impact our financial condition   under item 1a risk factors and   note 21 in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

employees 

as of december 29 2012  we employed approximately 5200  people

 item 1a risk factors 

our business faces many risks described below under the headings risks related to our business and risks related to our securities and indebtedness are what we believe to be the material risks that we face if any of the events or circumstances described in the following risks actually occurs our business financial condition or results of operations could suffer 

risks related to our business 

uncertainty in the global economy in general and any potential downturn in the semiconductor and electronics industries in particular may negatively impact our business and reduce our bookings levels and revenue 

purchases of our products and services are dependent upon the commencement of new design projects by ic manufacturers and electronics systems companies the ic and electronics systems industries are cyclical and are characterized by constant and rapid technological change rapid product obsolescence and price erosion evolving standards short product life cycles and wide fluctuations in product supply and demand 

for example the ic and electronics systems industries experienced a significant downturn in 2009 the ic and electronic systems industries have also experienced significant downturns in connection with or in anticipation of maturing product cycles of both these industries and their customers products this economic downturn in the industries we serve contributed to the reduction in our revenue in 2009 as compared to prior years although the semiconductor industry experienced growth in 2010 semiconductor industry revenues for 2011 remained at levels similar to 2010 and early reports indicate that semiconductor industry revenue during 2012 was slightly lower than 2011 spending on eda products and services grew moderately during fiscal 2012 

while spending on eda products and services has grown in recent years the outlook for the semiconductor industry for 2013 is uncertain and may result in a decrease in spending on eda products and services 

while we cannot predict global economic conditions uncertainty about future economic conditions and future decline in consumer spending could negatively impact our customers businesses reducing the number of new chip designs their overall research and development spending including their spending on eda products and services and as a result decrease demand for our products decreased bookings for our products and services customer bankruptcies or consolidation among our customers could also adversely affect our ability to grow our business our future business and financial results are subject to considerable uncertainty that could impact our stock price if economic conditions deteriorate in the future or in particular if semiconductor industry revenues do not grow our future revenues and financial results could be adversely affected however if economic conditions improve for our customers the positive impact on our revenues and financial results may be deferred due to cautious customer research and development spending and our ratable license mix 

our failure to respond quickly to technological developments or customers increasing technological requirements could make our products uncompetitive and obsolete 

the industries in which we compete experience rapid technology developments changes in industry standards and customer requirements and frequent new product introductions and improvements currently the industries we serve are experiencing the following trends 

 if we are unable to respond quickly and successfully to these trends we may lose our competitive position and our products or technologies may become obsolete to compete successfully we must develop acquire or license new products and improve our existing products and processes on a schedule that keeps pace with technological developments and the requirements for products addressing a broad spectrum of designers and designer expertise in our industries our hardware platforms must be enhanced periodically to reduce the likelihood that a competitor surpasses the capabilities we offer we must also be able to support a range of changing computer software hardware platforms and customer preferences a rapid transition to different business models associated with cloud computing technologies could result in reduced revenue we cannot guarantee that we will be successful in keeping pace with all or any of the customer trends 

warrant transactions associated with our convertible notes will in certain circumstances dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders 

at the time of issuance of our convertible notes due in 2015 we entered into separate warrant transactions for the purchase of up to approximately 464 million  shares of our common stock at a strike price of 1078  per share at the time of issuance of our convertible noes due 2013 we also entered into separate warrant transactions and warrants are currently outstanding to purchase approximately 68 million shares of our common stock at a strike price of 3150  per share these warrants will be settled in net shares therefore upon expiration of the warrants we will issue shares of our common stock to the purchasers of the warrants that represent the value by which the price of our common stock exceeds the strike price stipulated within the particular warrant agreement if our stock price is above the warrants strike price upon expiration of the warrants the warrants will dilute the ownership interest to our existing stockholders the warrants will also dilute our diluted earnings per share in periods when our average closing stock price exceeds the strike price of the particular warrant any sales in the public market of common stock issuable upon net settlement at expiration of the warrants could adversely affect then current market prices of our common stock additional risk factors related to our indebtedness are described below under risks related to our securities and indebtedness 

our stock price has been subject to significant fluctuations and may continue to be subject to fluctuations 

the market price of our common stock has experienced significant fluctuations and may fluctuate or decline in the future and as a result you could lose the value of your investment the market price of our common stock may be affected by a number of factors including but not limited to 

 in addition equity markets in general and the equities of technology companies in particular have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations such price and volume fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock for reasons unrelated to our business or operating results 

we have experienced varied operating results and our operating results for any particular fiscal period are affected by the timing of revenue recognition particularly for our hardware products 

we have recorded net losses in the past and may record net losses in the future various factors affect our operating results and some of them are not within our control our operating results for any period are affected by the timing of revenue recognition particularly for our hardware products 

a substantial portion of the product revenue related to our hardware business is recognized upon delivery revenue related to our hardware business is inherently difficult to predict because sales of our hardware products depend on the commencement of new projects for the design and development of complex ics and systems by our customers and our customers willingness to expend capital to deploy our hardware in those projects therefore our hardware sales may be delayed or may decrease if our customers delay or cancel projects because their capital spending is constrained moreover the verification hardware market is highly competitive and our customers may choose to purchase a competitors verification hardware product based on cost performance or other factors these factors may result in lower hardware revenue which would have an adverse effect on our business results of operations or cash flows additionally our forecasted revenue results are based in part on our expectations of hardware to be delivered in a particular quarter since revenue related to our hardware business is generally recognized upon delivery changes in hardware bookings or deliveries relative to expectations will have a more immediate impact on our revenue than do changes in software or services bookings for which revenue is generally recognized over time 

our software license mix is such that a substantial proportion of licenses require ratable revenue recognition and we expect the license mix combined with the modest growth in spending by our customers in the semiconductor sector may make it difficult for us to rapidly increase our revenue in future fiscal periods the timing of our revenue recognition may be deferred until payments 

become due and payable from customers with nonlinear payment terms or as cash is collected from customers with low credit ratings 

we plan our operating expenses based on forecasted revenue expected business needs and other factors these expenses and the effect of longterm commitments are relatively fixed in the short term bookings and the related revenue are harder to forecast in a difficult economic environment if the macroeconomic environment weakens and we experience a shortfall in bookings our operating results could differ from our expectations because we may not be able to quickly reduce our expenses in response to shortterm business changes 

the methods estimates and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies have a significant impact on our results of operations see critical accounting estimates under part ii item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations such methods estimates and judgments are by their nature subject to substantial risks uncertainties and assumptions and factors may arise over time that may lead us to change our methods estimates and judgments changes in those methods estimates and judgments could significantly affect our results of operations 

you should not view our historical results of operations as reliable indicators of our future performance if our revenue operating results or business outlook for future periods fall short of the levels expected by us securities analysts or investors the trading price of our common stock could decline 

we depend on sole suppliers for certain hardware components making us vulnerable to supply disruption and price fluctuation 

we depend on sole suppliers for certain hardware components our reliance on sole suppliers could result in product delivery problems and reduced control over product pricing and quality though we prefer to have multiple sources to procure certain key components in some cases it is not practical or feasible to do so we may suffer a disruption in the supply of certain hardware components if we are unable to purchase sufficient components on a timely basis or at all for any reason any supply disruption could delay our production process and prevent us from delivering completed hardware products to customers or from supplying new evaluation units to customers which could have a negative impact on our revenue and operating results 

the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations may adversely impact our revenue expenses cash flows and financial condition 

we have significant operations outside the united states our revenue from international operations as a percentage of total revenue was approximately 57  during fiscal 2012 57  during fiscal 2011 and 59  during fiscal 2010 we expect that revenue from our international operations will continue to account for a significant portion of our total revenue we also transact business in various foreign currencies the volatility of foreign currencies in certain countries where we conduct business most notably the japanese yen european union euro british pound and indian rupee have had and may in the future have an effect on our revenue or operating results 

fluctuations in the rate of exchange between the united states or us dollar and the currencies of other countries where we conduct business could seriously affect our business operating results or financial condition for example when a foreign currency declines in value relative to the us dollar it takes more of the foreign currency to purchase the same amount of us dollars than before the change if we price our products and services in the foreign currency we receive fewer us dollars than we did before the change if we price our products and services in us dollars the decrease in value of the local currency results in an increase in the price for our products and services compared to those products of our competitors that are priced in local currency this could result in our prices being uncompetitive in markets where business is transacted in the local currency on the other hand when a foreign currency increases in value relative to the us dollar it takes more us dollars to purchase the same amount of the foreign currency as we use the foreign currency to fund payroll costs and other operating expenses in our international operations this results in an increase in operating expenses our attempts to reduce the effect of foreign currency fluctuations may be unsuccessful and significant exchange rate movements may hurt our results of operations as expressed in us dollars 

litigation could adversely affect our financial condition or operations 

we currently are and in the future may be involved in various disputes and litigation that arise in the ordinary course of business these include disputes and lawsuits related to intellectual property including customer indemnification mergers and acquisitions licensing contracts distribution arrangements and employee relations matters for information regarding the litigation matters in which we are currently engaged please refer to the discussion under item 3 legal proceedings and note 15 in the notes to consolidated financial statements we cannot provide any assurances that the final outcome of these lawsuits or any other proceedings that may arise in the future will not have a material adverse effect on our business operating results financial condition or cash flows litigation can be time consuming and expensive and could divert managements time and attention from our business which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and operating results 

our future revenue is dependent in part upon our installed customer base continuing to license or buy additional products and purchase additional services 

our installed customer base has traditionally generated additional new license service and maintenance revenues in future periods customers may not necessarily license or buy additional products or contract for additional services or maintenance our customers many of which are large semiconductor and systems companies often have significant bargaining power in negotiations with us mergers or acquisitions of our customers can reduce the total level of purchases of our software and services and in some cases increase customers bargaining power in negotiations with their suppliers including us 

the competition in our industries is substantial and we may not be able to continue to successfully compete in our industries 

the eda industry and the commercial electronics engineering services industry are highly competitive if we fail to compete successfully in these industries it could seriously harm our business operating results or financial condition to compete in these industries we must identify and develop or acquire innovative and costcompetitive eda products integrate them into platforms and market them in a timely manner we may not be able to compete successfully in these industries factors that could affect our ability to succeed include 

 we compete in the eda market most frequently with synopsys inc and mentor graphics corporation but also with numerous other eda providers such as ansys inc atrenta inc atoptech inc berkeley design automation inc and zuken ltd and many others offering point solutions with manufacturers of electronic devices that have developed acquired or have the capability to develop their own eda products and with numerous electronics design and consulting companies in the area of design ip we compete with synopsys and numerous smaller ip companies during fiscal 2012 synopsys acquired magma design automation inc eve sa and springsoft inc we expect that synopsys integration of these companies into its product offerings will result in increased competitive pressures that could harm our business results of operations or cash flows 

we may need to change our pricing models to compete successfully competitive pressures could constrain the prices we can charge for our products which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

the highly competitive markets in which we do business can put pressure on us to reduce the prices of our products if our competitors offer deep discounts on certain products in an effort to recapture or gain market share or to sell other software or hardware products we may then need to lower our prices or offer other favorable terms to compete successfully any such changes would be likely to reduce our profit margins and could adversely affect our operating results any substantial changes to our prices and pricing policies could cause sales and software license revenues to decline or be delayed as our sales force implements and our customers adjust to the new pricing policies some of our competitors may bundle products for promotional purposes or as a longterm pricing strategy or provide guarantees of prices and product implementations these practices could over time significantly constrain the prices that we can charge for our products if we cannot offset price reductions with a corresponding increase in the number of sales or with lower spending then the reduced license revenues resulting from lower prices could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

risks associated with our international operations could seriously harm our financial condition 

a significant amount of our revenue is derived from our international operations and we have offices throughout the world including key research and development facilities outside of the united states our international operations may be subject to a number of risks including 

 some of our international research and development and other facilities are in parts of the world that are not as politically stable as the united states consequently we may face a greater risk of business interruption as a result of terrorist acts or military conflicts than businesses located domestically furthermore this potential harm is exacerbated because damage to or disruptions at our international research and development facilities could have a more significant adverse effect on our ability to develop new or improve existing products than other businesses that may only have sales offices or other less critical operations abroad we are not insured for losses or interruptions caused by acts of war furthermore our operations are dependent upon the connectivity of our operations throughout the world activities that interfere with our international connectivity such as cyber hacking the introduction of a virus into our computer systems or natural disasters near any of our international locations could significantly interfere with our business operations 

in addition internal controls policies and procedures and employee training and compliance programs that we have implemented to deter prohibited practices may not prevent our employees contractors or agents from violating or circumventing our policies and the laws and regulations applicable to our worldwide operations 

we depend upon our management team and key employees and our failure to attract train motivate and retain management and key employees may make us less competitive in our industries and therefore harm our results of operations 

our business depends upon the continued services efforts and abilities of our senior management and other key employees competition for highly skilled executive officers and employees can be intense particularly in geographic areas recognized as high technology centers such as the silicon valley area where our principal offices are located and in other locations where we maintain facilities we may also experience increased compensation costs that are not offset by either improved productivity or higher sales we may not be successful in recruiting new personnel and in retaining and motivating existing personnel from time to time there may be changes in our management team resulting from the hiring and departure of executive officers and as a result we may experience disruption to our business that may harm our operating results and our relationships with our employees customers and suppliers may be adversely affected to attract retain and motivate individuals with the requisite expertise we may be required to grant large numbers of stock options or other stockbased incentive awards which may be dilutive to existing stockholders and increase compensation expense and pay significant base salaries and cash bonuses which could harm our operating results the high cost of training new employees not fully utilizing these employees or losing trained employees to competing employers could also reduce our operating margins and harm our business or operating results 

in addition applicable rules and regulations require stockholder approval for new equity compensation plans and significant amendments to existing equity compensation plans including increases in shares available for issuance under such plans and prohibit publiclytraded companies from giving a proxy to vote on equity compensation plans unless the beneficial owner of the shares has given voting instructions these rules and regulations could make it more difficult for us to grant equity compensation to employees in the future to the extent that these regulations make it more difficult or expensive to grant equity compensation to employees we may incur increased compensation costs or find it difficult to attract retain and motivate employees which could materially and adversely affect our business 

we may not receive significant revenue from our current research and development efforts for several years if at all 

developing eda products and ip and integrating acquired technology into existing platforms is expensive and these investments often require a long time to generate returns our strategy involves significant investments in research and development and related product opportunities we believe that we must continue to dedicate a significant amount of resources to our research and development efforts to maintain and improve our competitive position however we cannot ensure that we will receive significant if any revenue from these investments 

we have acquired and expect to acquire other companies and businesses and may not realize the expected benefits of these acquisitions 

we have acquired and expect to acquire other companies and businesses in the future while we expect to carefully analyze each potential acquisition before committing to the transaction we may not consummate any particular transaction but may nonetheless incur significant costs or if a transaction is consummated we may not be able to integrate and manage acquired products and businesses effectively or to integrate and retain key personnel from the acquired companies or businesses in addition acquisitions involve a number of risks if any of the following acquisitionrelated risks occur our business operating results or financial condition could be seriously harmed 

 in a number of our completed acquisitions we have agreed to make future payments either in the form of employee bonuses or contingent purchase price payments based on the performance of the acquired businesses or the employees who joined us with the acquired businesses we may continue to use contingent purchase price payments in connection with acquisitions in the future the performance goals pursuant to which these future payments may be made generally relate to achievement by the acquired business or by the employees who joined us with the acquired business of certain specified bookings revenue run rate product proliferation product development or employee retention goals during a specified period following completion of the applicable acquisition future acquisitions may involve issuances of stock as full or partial payment of the purchase price for the acquired business grants of incentive stock or options to employees of the acquired businesses which may be dilutive to existing stockholders expenditure of substantial cash resources or the incurrence of material amounts of debt these arrangements may impact our liquidity financial position and results of operations 

the specific performance goal levels and amounts and timing of employee bonuses or contingent purchase price payments vary with each acquisition while we expect to derive value from an acquisition in excess of such contingent payment obligations our strategy may change and we may be required to make certain contingent payments without deriving the anticipated value 

we rely on our proprietary technology as well as software and other intellectual property rights licensed to us by third parties and we cannot assure you that the precautions taken to protect our rights will be adequate or that we will continue to be able to adequately secure such intellectual property rights from third parties 

our success depends in part upon our proprietary technology we generally rely on patents copyrights trademarks trade secret laws licenses and restrictive agreements to establish and protect our proprietary rights in technology and products despite the precautions we may take to protect our intellectual property third parties have tried in the past and may try in the future to challenge invalidate or circumvent these safeguards our patents or other intellectual property rights may not provide us with sufficient competitive advantages patents may not be issued on any of our pending applications and our issued patents may not 

be sufficiently broad to protect our technology furthermore the laws of foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights in those countries to the same extent as applicable law protects these rights in the united states the protection of our intellectual property may require the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources moreover the steps we take to protect our intellectual property may not adequately protect our rights or deter or prevent third parties from infringing or misappropriating our proprietary rights 

many of our products include software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties we may have to seek new or renew existing licenses for such software and other intellectual property in the future our engineering services business holds licenses to certain software and other intellectual property owned by third parties including that of our competitors our failure to obtain software other intellectual property licenses or other intellectual property rights that are necessary or helpful for our business on favorable terms or our need to engage in litigation over these licenses or rights could seriously harm our business operating results or financial condition 

we could suffer serious harm to our business because of the infringement of our intellectual property rights by third parties or because of our infringement of the intellectual property rights of third parties 

there are numerous eda vip and design ip productrelated patents new patents are being issued at a rapid rate and are owned by eda companies as well as entities and individuals outside the eda industry including parties whose income is primarily derived from infringementrelated litigation it is not always practicable to determine in advance whether a product or any of its components infringes the patent rights of others as a result from time to time we may be compelled to respond to or prosecute intellectual property infringement claims to protect our rights or defend a customers rights 

intellectual property infringement claims including contractual defense reimbursement obligations related to thirdparty claims against our customers regardless of merit could consume valuable management time result in costly litigation or cause product shipment delays all of which could seriously harm our business operating results or financial condition the risk of infringement and related indemnification claims associated with design ip products that are incorporated into a customer product broadly used by consumers may be higher than the risk associated with our software products in settling these claims we may be required to enter into royalty or licensing agreements with the third parties claiming infringement these royalty or licensing agreements if available may not have terms favorable to us being compelled to enter into a license agreement with unfavorable terms could seriously harm our business operating results or financial condition any potential intellectual property litigation could compel us to do one or more of the following 

 if we were compelled to take any of these actions our business or operating results may suffer 

our operating results and revenue could be adversely affected by customer payment delays customer bankruptcies and defaults or modifications of licenses 

occasionally our customers file for bankruptcy or request to modify license terms if our customers experience adversity in their business they may delay or default on their payment obligations to us file for bankruptcy or modify or cancel plans to license our products for instance if our customers are not successful in generating sufficient cash or are precluded from securing financing they may not be able to pay or may delay payment of accounts receivable that are owed to us although these obligations are generally not cancelable our customers inability to fulfill payment obligations in turn may adversely affect our revenue and cash flow additionally our customers may seek to renegotiate preexisting contractual commitments payment defaults by our customers or significant reductions in existing contractual commitments could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results because of the relatively high levels of volatility that continue to drive significant fluctuations in asset prices as well as concern regarding high levels of leverage in sovereign and corporate debt the capital and credit markets are volatile and unpredictable if we were to seek funding from the capital or credit markets in response to any material level of customer defaults we may not be able to secure funding on terms acceptable to us or at all which may have a material negative effect on our business 

if our security measures are breached and an unauthorized party obtains access to customer data or our proprietary business information our information systems may be perceived as being unsecure which could harm our business and reputation 

our products and services involve the storage and transmission of our proprietary information and that of our customers we have offices throughout the world including key research and development facilities outside of the united states our operations are dependent upon the connectivity of our operations throughout the world despite our security measures our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to cyber attacks or breached due to an employee error or other disruption that could result in unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information and could significantly interfere with our business operations breaches of our security measures could expose us to a risk of loss or misuse of this information litigation and potential liability because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage information systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventive measures in addition if we select a vendor that uses cyber storage of information as part of their service or product offerings despite our attempts to validate the security of such services our proprietary information may be misappropriated by third parties in the event of an actual or perceived breach of our security or the security of one of our vendors the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed and we could suffer damage to our reputation or our business or lose existing customers and lose our ability to obtain new customers 

the long sales cycle of our products and services may cause our operating results to fluctuate unexpectedly 

generally we have a long sales cycle that can extend up to six months or longer the complexity and expense associated with our products and services generally require a lengthy customer education evaluation and approval process consequently we may incur substantial expenses and devote significant management effort and expense to develop potential relationships that do not result in agreements or revenue and may prevent us from pursuing other opportunities 

in addition sales of our products and services have been and may in the future be delayed if customers delay approval or commencement of projects because of 

 long sales cycles for acceleration and emulation hardware products subject us to a number of significant risks over which we have limited control including insufficient excess or obsolete inventory variations in inventory valuation and fluctuations in quarterly operating results 

our reported financial results may be adversely affected by changes in united states generally accepted accounting principles and we may incur significant costs to adjust our accounting systems and processes to comply with significant changes 

united states generally accepted accounting principles are subject to interpretation by the financial accounting standards board or fasb the american institute of certified public accountants the sec and various bodies formed to promulgate and interpret appropriate accounting principles during fiscal 2010 the fasb issued exposure drafts of proposed accounting principles related to revenue recognition and leases which could change the way we account for certain of our transactions the fasb issued a revised exposure draft of proposed accounting principles related to revenue recognition during fiscal 2011 and has continued to discuss these and other proposed accounting principles during fiscal 2012 a change in these or other principles or interpretations could have a significant effect on our reported financial results and could affect the reporting of transactions completed before the announcement of a change in addition the sec is considering a multiyear plan that could ultimately lead to the use of international financial reporting standards by united states issuers in their sec filings any such change could have a significant effect on our reported financial results 

in addition we may need to significantly change our accounting systems and processes if we are required to adopt the proposed changes in accounting principles noted above the cost of these changes may negatively impact our results of operations during the periods of transition 

we have substantial cash requirements in the united states but a significant portion of our cash is held and generated outside of the united states and if our cash available in the united states and the cash available under our revolving credit facility is insufficient to meet our operating expenses and debt repayment obligations in the united states then we may be required to raise cash in ways that could negatively affect our financial condition results of operations and the market price of our common stock 

we have significant operations outside the united states as of december 29 2012  approximately 50  of our cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments balance was held by subsidiaries outside the united states with the remainder of the balance held by us or our subsidiaries in the united states we believe that the combination of our existing united states cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments balances future united states operating cash flows and cash available under our revolving credit facility are sufficient to meet our ongoing united states operating expenses and debt repayment obligations however if these sources of cash were insufficient to meet our future funding obligations in the united states we could be required to seek other available funding sources which could negatively impact our results of operations financial position and the market price of our common stock 

the investment of our cash cash equivalents and investments in money market funds and marketable debt securities are subject to risks which may cause losses and affect the liquidity of these investments 

our investments include various money market funds and marketable debt securities such as corporate debt securities united states treasury securities united states government agency securities bank certificates of deposit and commercial paper weakened financial markets have at times adversely impacted the general credit liquidity market prices and interest rates for these and other types of debt securities additionally changes in monetary policy by the federal open market committee and concerns about the rising united states government debt level may cause a decrease in the purchasing power of the united states dollar and adversely affect our investment portfolio the financial market and monetary risks associated with our investment portfolio may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition liquidity results of operations or cash flows 

our operating results could be adversely affected as a result of changes in our effective tax rates or by material differences between our forecasted annual effective tax rates and actual tax rates 

our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by the following 

 any significant change in our future effective tax rates could adversely impact our results of operations for future periods 

forecasts of our annual effective tax rate are complex and subject to uncertainty because our income tax position for each year combines the effects of estimating our annual income or loss the mix of profits and losses earned by us and our subsidiaries in tax jurisdictions with a broad range of income tax rates as well as benefits from available deferred tax assets the impact of various accounting rules and results of tax audits forecasts of our annual effective tax rate do not include the anticipation of future tax law changes if there were a material difference between forecasted and actual tax rates then it could have a material impact on our results of operations 

the irs and other tax authorities regularly examine our tax returns and the outcome of current and future tax examinations may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows 

the irs and other tax authorities regularly examine our income tax returns the calculation of our provision benefit for income taxes requires us to use significant judgment and involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in determining the adequacy of our provision benefit for income taxes we regularly assess the potential settlement outcomes resulting from income tax examinations however the final outcome of tax examinations including the total amount payable or the timing of any such payments upon resolution of these issues cannot be estimated with certainty in addition we cannot be certain that such amount will not be materially different from the amount that is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals should the irs or other tax authorities assess additional taxes as a result of a current or a future examination we may be required to record charges to operations in future periods that could have a material impact on our results of operations financial position or cash flows in the applicable period or periods 

our restructuring plans may not result in the benefits we have anticipated possibly having a negative effect on our future operating results 

in recent fiscal years we have initiated restructuring plans in an effort to decrease costs by reducing our workforce and by consolidating facilities the only remaining activities in our restructuring plans relate to facilities vacated as part of these plans our restructuring plans may also subject us to litigation risks and expenses in addition our restructuring plans may have other consequences such as attrition beyond our planned reduction in workforce a negative effect on employee morale or our ability to attract highly skilled employees our competitors may also seek to gain a competitive advantage over us the restructuring plans could also cause our remaining employees to leave or result in reduced productivity by our employees and in turn this may affect our revenue and other operating results in the future 

failure to obtain export licenses could harm our business by rendering us unable to ship products and transfer our technology outside of the united states 

we must comply with regulations of the united states and of certain other countries in shipping our software products and transferring our technology outside the united states and to foreign nationals any significant future difficulty in complying could harm our business operating results or financial condition 

errors or defects in our products and services could expose us to liability and harm our reputation 

our customers use our products and services in designing and developing products that involve a high degree of technological complexity each of which has its own specifications because of the complexity of the systems and products with which we work some of our products and designs can be adequately tested only when put to full use in the marketplace as a result our customers or their end users may discover errors or defects in our software or the systems we design or the products or systems incorporating our design and intellectual property may not operate as expected errors or defects could result in 

 if we become subject to unfair hiring claims we could be prevented from hiring needed employees incur liability for damages and incur substantial costs in defending ourselves 

companies in our industry that lose employees to competitors frequently claim that these competitors have engaged in unfair hiring practices or that the employment of these persons would involve the disclosure or use of trade secrets these claims could prevent us from hiring employees or cause us to incur liability for damages we could also incur substantial costs in defending ourselves or our employees against these claims regardless of their merits defending ourselves from these claims could also divert the attention of our management away from our operations 

antitakeover defenses in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and certain provisions under delaware law could prevent an acquisition of our company or limit the price that investors might be willing to pay for our common stock 

our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and certain provisions of the delaware general corporation law that apply to us could make it difficult for another company to acquire control of our company for example 

 all or any one of these factors could limit the price that certain investors would be willing to pay for shares of our common stock and could allow our board of directors to resist delay or prevent an acquisition of our company even if a proposed transaction were favored by a majority of our independent stockholders 

our business is subject to the risk of earthquakes and other natural disasters 

our corporate headquarters including certain of our research and development operations and certain of our distribution facilities is located in the silicon valley area of northern california a region known to experience seismic activity if significant seismic activity were to occur our operations may be interrupted which could adversely impact our business and results of operations 

our other offices in the united states and in other countries around the world may be adversely impacted by natural disasters if a natural disaster occurs at or near any of our offices our operations may be interrupted which could adversely impact our business and results of operations if a natural disaster impacts a significant number of our customers our business and results of operations could be adversely impacted 

risks related to our securities and indebtedness 

our debt obligations expose us to risks that could adversely affect our business operating results or financial condition and could prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under such indebtedness 

we have a substantial level of debt and we currently have the ability to borrow an additional 250 million under a credit facility as of december 29 2012  we had outstanding indebtedness with a principal balance of 4947 million  as follows 

 the level of our current or future indebtedness among other things could 

 

we have entered into a 250 million  fiveyear senior secured revolving credit facility as of december 29 2012  we do not have any borrowings outstanding under the credit facility but we may draw down on the facility in the future to finance working 

capital capital expenditures mergers and acquisitions and other business purposes which would increase our indebtedness any outstanding loans drawn under this agreement are payable on or before december 12 2017  we have the option to increase the maximum borrowings on our credit facility up to an additional 150 million  if our lenders approve our request the credit facility contains customary negative covenants that among other things restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness grant liens and make certain investments complete acquisitions dispose of certain assets and make certain payments including dividends in addition the credit facility contains certain financial covenants that require us to maintain a leverage ratio of not greater than 3 to 1 subject to certain exceptions and requires that we maintain an interest coverage ratio of at least 3 to 1 these financial covenants could limit our flexibility in conducting our business and any borrowings outstanding under the credit facility could be accelerated if we fail to comply with these covenants 

if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow or otherwise obtain funds necessary to make required payments or if we fail to comply with the various requirements of our indebtedness we would be in default which would permit the holders of our indebtedness to accelerate the maturity of the indebtedness and could cause defaults under any other indebtedness as well additionally in the event of a default certain assets that secure the borrowings could be seized by our lenders which could adversely impact our ability to operate 

any default under our indebtedness could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition in addition a material default on our indebtedness could suspend our eligibility to register securities using certain registration statement forms under sec guidelines that permit incorporation by reference of substantial information regarding us potentially hindering our ability to raise capital through the issuance of our securities and increasing our costs of registration 

conversion of our 2013 notes and 2015 notes prior to the scheduled maturities of the notes may adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition 

holders of our 2013 notes and 2015 notes may convert their notes into cash prior to the scheduled maturities if any of the conversion conditions for those notes are met the 2015 notes are convertible into cash only and the 2013 notes are convertible into a combination of cash and shares of our common stock 

in order for the 2015 notes to be convertible into cash in a particular fiscal quarter a conversion condition must be met during the preceding fiscal quarter during the three months ended december 29 2012  our closing stock price exceeded 981  for at least 20  of the last 30  trading days prior to december 29 2012  as a result the 2015 notes are convertible into cash from december 30 2012  through march 30 2013  and we have classified our 2015 notes as a current liability on our consolidated balance sheet as of december 29 2012  the 2013 notes are not currently convertible 

so long as the 2015 notes are outstanding we will assess whether this conversion condition has been met at the end of each fiscal quarter if a conversion condition is met in any future fiscal quarter we would classify our 2015 notes as a current liability on our consolidated balance sheet as of the end of that fiscal quarter 

if one or more of the 2013 or 2015 note holders elect to convert their notes at a time when the conversion conditions have been met we would be required to settle the converted principal and in the case of the 2015 notes the conversion value through payment of cash which could adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition 

at the option of the holders of the 2013 notes and the 2015 notes under certain circumstances we may be required to repurchase the 2013 notes or the 2015 notes in cash 

under the terms of the 2013 notes and the 2015 notes we may be required to repurchase the 2013 notes and the 2015 notes following a fundamental change in our corporate ownership or structure such as a change of control in which substantially all of the consideration does not consist of publicly traded securities prior to maturity of the 2013 notes and the 2015 notes the repurchase price for the 2013 notes and the 2015 notes in the event of a fundamental change must be paid solely in cash this repayment obligation may have the effect of discouraging delaying or preventing a takeover of our company payment of the notes prior to their scheduled maturities could have a significant negative impact on our cash and liquidity and could impact our ability to invest financial resources in other strategic initiatives 

hedge and warrant transactions entered into in connection with the issuance of the 2013 notes and the 2015 notes may affect the value of our common stock 

we entered into hedge transactions with various financial institutions at the time of issuance of the 2013 notes and the 2015 notes with the objective of limiting the potential dilutive effect of issuing our common stock upon conversion of the 2013 notes and our exposure to the additional cash payments above the principal amount upon conversion of the 2015 notes we also entered into separate warrant transactions with the same financial institutions in connection with our hedge and warrant transactions associated with the 2013 notes and the 2015 notes these financial institutions purchased our common stock in secondary market 

transactions and entered into various overthecounter derivative transactions with respect to our common stock these entities or their affiliates are likely to modify their hedge positions from time to time prior to conversion or maturity of the 2013 notes and the 2015 notes by purchasing and selling shares of our common stock other of our securities or other instruments they may wish to use in connection with such hedging any of these transactions and activities could adversely affect the value of our common stock and as a result the number of shares and the value of the common stock that the 2013 note holders will receive upon conversion of the 2013 notes and the amount of cash that 2015 notes holders will receive upon conversion of the 2015 notes 

we are subject to the risk that the hedge participants fail to fulfill their obligations under the 2013 notes hedge transactions and the 2015 notes hedge transactions 

if any of the participants in the hedge transactions is unwilling or unable to perform its obligations for any reason we would not be able to receive the benefit of such transaction we cannot provide any assurances as to the financial stability or viability of any of the participants in the hedge transactions our 2015 notes were convertible as of december 29 2012  the convertible note hedge transactions in connection with the 2015 notes or the 2015 notes hedges are intended to reduce our exposure above the 3500 million  principal balance in the event of a cash conversion of the 2015 notes if the hedge participants fail to meet their obligations for any reason it could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and financial condition 

rating agencies may provide unsolicited ratings on the 2013 notes and the 2015 notes that could reduce the market value or liquidity of our 2013 notes 2015 notes or our common stock 

we have not requested a rating of the 2013 notes or the 2015 notes from any rating agency and we do not anticipate that the 2013 notes or the 2015 notes will be rated however if one or more rating agencies independently elects to rate the 2013 notes or the 2015 notes and assigns the 2013 notes or the 2015 notes a rating lower than the rating expected by investors or reduces such rating in the future the market price or liquidity of the 2013 notes or the 2015 notes as the case may be and our common stock could be harmed should a decline occur in the market price of the 2013 notes or the 2015 notes as compared to the price of our common stock this may trigger the right of the holders of the 2013 notes or the 2015 notes to convert such notes into cash and shares of our common stock as applicable

none 




 item 2 properties 

we own land and buildings at our headquarters located in san jose california we also own buildings in india as of december 29 2012  the total square footage of our owned buildings was approximately 965000  

we lease additional facilities in the united states and various other countries we sublease certain of these facilities where space is not fully utilized or has been impacted as part of our restructuring plans 

we believe that these facilities are adequate for our current needs and that suitable additional or substitute space will be available as needed to accommodate any expansion of our operations 




 item 3 legal proceedings 

from time to time we are involved in various disputes and litigation that arise in the ordinary course of business these include disputes and lawsuits related to intellectual property indemnification obligations mergers and acquisitions licensing contracts distribution arrangements and employee relations matters at least quarterly we review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure if the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount or the range of loss can be estimated we accrue a liability for the estimated loss legal proceedings are subject to uncertainties and the outcomes are difficult to predict because of such uncertainties accruals are based on our judgments using the best information available at the time as additional information becomes available we reassess the potential liability related to pending claims and litigation matters and may revise our estimates 

on april 23 2012 the united states district court entered final approval of the settlements of our thenpending derivative and securities litigation and dismissed those lawsuits see note 15 in the notes to consolidated financial statements for an additional description of our legal proceedings and these settlements

 item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

  

the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k and with part i item 1a risk factors please refer to the cautionary language at the beginning of part i of this annual report on form 10k regarding forwardlooking statements 

business overview 

we develop eda software hardware and ip we license software and ip sell or lease hardware technology provide maintenance for our offerings and provide engineering and education services to help manage and accelerate product development processes for semiconductor and electronics systems companies our customers use our products and services to design and develop complex ics and electronics systems 

substantially all of our revenue is generated from semiconductor and electronics systems manufacturers and designers and is dependent upon their commencement of new design projects as a result our revenue is significantly influenced by our customers business outlook and investment in the introduction of new products and the improvement of existing products 

we have identified certain items that management uses as performance indicators to manage our business including revenue certain elements of operating expenses and cash flow from operations and we describe these items further below under the heading results of operations and liquidity and capital resources 

critical accounting estimates 

in preparing our consolidated financial statements we make assumptions judgments and estimates that can have a significant impact on our revenue operating income loss and net income as well as on the value of certain assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets we base our assumptions judgments and estimates on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions at least quarterly we evaluate our assumptions judgments and estimates and make changes as deemed necessary we believe that the assumptions judgments and estimates involved in the accounting for income taxes revenue recognition allowance for doubtful accounts business combinations intangible asset and goodwill impairments and fair value of financial instruments have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements therefore we consider these to be our critical accounting estimates for information on our significant accounting policies see note 2 in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

accounting for income taxes 

we provide for the effect of income taxes in our consolidated financial statements using the asset and liability method we also apply a twostep approach to determine the financial statement recognition and measurement of uncertain tax positions 

we must make significant assumptions judgments and estimates to determine our current provision benefit for income taxes our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance to be recorded against our deferred tax assets our judgments assumptions and estimates relating to the current provision benefit for income taxes include the geographic mix and amount of income loss our interpretation of current tax laws and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax authorities our judgments also include anticipating the tax positions we will take on tax returns before actually preparing and filing the tax returns changes in our business tax laws or our interpretation of tax laws and developments in current and future tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our results of operations financial position or cash flows 

deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to tax benefit carryforwards and to differences between the financial statement amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis we regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized to make this judgment we must make predictions of the amount and category of taxable income from various sources and weigh all available positive and negative evidence about these possible sources of taxable income we give greater weight to evidence that can be objectively verified for the year ended december 29 2012 we judged that our history of operating profits in the united states and our expectations of future profits considering our software ratable revenue recognition model and ending backlog of revenue as of december 29 2012 were sufficient positive evidence to release a significant portion of the valuation allowance against our united states deferred tax assets however if in the future we determine that we no longer meet the realization threshold for some or all of our deferred tax assets then we would need to establish a valuation allowance that could result in a material provision for income taxes in the period such determination is made for an additional description of the valuation allowance see note 6 in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

we only recognize the tax benefit of an income tax position if we judge that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained solely on its technical merits in a tax audit including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes to make this judgment we must interpret complex and sometimes ambiguous tax laws regulations and administrative practices if we judge that an income tax position meets this recognition threshold then we must measure the amount of the tax benefit to be recognized by estimating the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50 cumulative probability of being realized upon effective settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all of the relevant facts it is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts as this requires us to determine the probability of various possible settlement outcomes to determine when a tax position is effectively settled we must estimate the likelihood that a taxing authority would rereview a tax position after a tax examination has otherwise been completed we must also determine when it is reasonably possible that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits will significantly increase or decrease in the 12 months after each fiscal yearend these judgments are difficult because a taxing authority may change its behavior as a result of our disclosures in our financial statements or for other reasons in addition we are required by the irs to disclose uncertain tax positions taken on our federal tax returns we must reevaluate our income tax positions on a quarterly basis to consider factors such as changes in facts or circumstances changes in tax law effectively settled issues under audit and new audit activity such a change in recognition or measurement would result in recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision for the year ended december 29 2012 we made the judgment that we had effectively settled certain tax positions related to the state of california franchise tax board or the ftb examination of our california tax returns for the 2001 through 2003 tax years that resulted in the recognition of a tax benefit for additional descriptions of our effective settlements see note 6 in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition 

we begin to recognize revenue when all of the following criteria are met 

   

significant judgment is involved in the determination of whether the facts and circumstances of an arrangement support that the fee for the arrangement is considered to be fixed or determinable and that collectibility of the fee is probable and these judgments can affect the amount of revenue that we recognize in a particular reporting period we must also make these judgments when assessing whether a contract amendment to a term arrangement primarily in the context of a license extension or renewal constitutes a concession our experience has been that we are able to determine whether a fee is fixed or determinable and we have established a history of collecting under contracts for which the fee has been assessed as fixed or determinable without providing concessions on payments products or services 

for installment contracts that do not include a substantial upfront payment we consider that a fee is fixed or determinable only if the arrangement has payment periods that are equal to or less than the term of the licenses and the payments are collected in equal or nearly equal installments when evaluated over the entire term of the arrangement while we do not expect our experience to change if we no longer were to have a history of collecting under the original contract without providing concessions on term licenses revenue from term licenses would be required to be recognized when payments under the installment contract become due and payable such a change could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

generally we are able to estimate whether collection is probable but significant judgment is applied as we assess the creditworthiness of our customers to make this determination if our experience were to change it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations if in our judgment collection of a fee is not probable we do not record revenue until the uncertainty is removed which is generally upon receipt of cash payment 

in general revenue for product and maintenance associated with term and subscription licenses is recognized ratably over the term of the license commencing upon the later of the effective date of the arrangement or delivery of the first software product the allocation of revenue to maintenance is based on a percentage of the total contract value as determined by the length of the contract in general product revenue associated with term and perpetual licenses where vendor specific objective evidence or vsoe exists for the undelivered maintenance is recognized upfront upon the later of the effective date of the arrangement or delivery of the software product provided all other conditions for revenue recognition have been met and maintenance revenue is recognized ratably over the maintenance term a relatively small percentage of our revenue from software licenses is recognized on an upfront basis 

sale of our hardware products generally involves the following deliverables the hardware product and its related essential software and maintenance for the hardware and the software consideration allocated to the hardware product and the essential 

software is recognized as revenue at the time of delivery provided all other conditions for revenue recognition have been met consideration allocated to the maintenance is recognized ratably over the maintenance term 

revenue from services contracts is recognized either on the time and materials method as work is performed or on the percentageofcompletion method if a service contract is considered to be part of a multiple element arrangement or mea that includes a software contract revenue is generally recognized ratably over the duration of the software contract for contracts with fixed or nottoexceed fees we estimate on a monthly basis the percentage of completion based on the completion of milestones relating to the arrangement we have a history of accurately estimating project status and the costs necessary to complete projects a number of internal and external factors can affect our estimates including labor rates utilization and efficiency variances and specification and testing requirement changes if different conditions were to prevail such that accurate estimates could not be made then the use of the completed contract method would be required and the recognition of all revenue and costs would be deferred until the project was completed such a change could have a material impact on our results of operations 

if a group of contracts is so closely related that they are in effect part of a single arrangement such arrangements are deemed to be an mea we exercise significant judgment to evaluate the relevant facts and circumstances in determining whether the separate contracts should be accounted for individually as distinct arrangements or whether the separate contracts are in substance an mea our judgments about whether a group of contracts is an mea can affect the timing of revenue recognition under those contracts which could have an effect on our results of operations for the periods involved for example a term or perpetual license agreement that would otherwise result in upfront revenue upon delivery may be deemed part of an mea when it is executed within close proximity or in contemplation of other license agreements that require ratable revenue recognition with the same customer in which event all the revenue is recognized over the longest term of any component of the mea instead of upfront 

  

for an mea that includes software and nonsoftware elements we allocate consideration to all software elements as a group and all nonsoftware elements based on their relative standalone selling prices revenue allocated to each deliverable is then recognized when all four criteria are met in these circumstances there is a hierarchy to determine the standalone selling price to be used for allocating consideration to the deliverables as follows 

• vendorspecific objective evidence of fair value or vsoe 

• thirdparty evidence of selling price or tpe and 

• best estimate of the selling price or besp 

we calculate the besp of our hardware products based on our pricing practices including the historical average prices charged for comparable hardware products because vsoe or tpe cannot be established our process for determining besp for our software deliverables without vsoe or tpe takes into account multiple factors that vary depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each deliverable key external and internal factors considered in developing the besps include prices charged by us for similar arrangements historical pricing practices and the nature of the product in addition when developing besps we may consider other factors as appropriate including the pricing of competitive alternatives if they exist and productspecific business objectives we exercise significant judgment to evaluate the relevant facts and circumstances in calculating the besp of the deliverables in our arrangements 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

we make judgments as to our ability to collect outstanding receivables and provide allowances for a portion of receivables when collection becomes doubtful this allowance is based on our assessment of the creditworthiness of our customers historical experience and the overall economic climate of the industries that we serve while we believe that our allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate we continue to monitor customer liquidity and other economic conditions which may result in changes to our estimates regarding our ability to collect from our customers changes in circumstances such as an unexpected change in a customers ability to meet its financial obligation to us or a customers payment trends or a downward trend in the volume of business in the semiconductor sector are hard to predict and may require us to adjust our estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to us these changes could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

business combinations 

when we acquire businesses we allocate the purchase price to acquired tangible assets and liabilities including deferred revenue liabilities associated with the fair value of contingent consideration and acquired identifiable intangible assets any residual purchase price is recorded as goodwill the allocation of the purchase price requires us to make significant estimates in determining the fair values of these acquired assets and assumed liabilities especially with respect to intangible assets and goodwill these estimates are based on information obtained from management of the acquired companies our assessment of this information and historical experience these estimates can include but are not limited to the cash flows that an acquired business is expected to generate in the future the cash flows that specific assets acquired with that business are expected to generate in the future the appropriate weightedaverage cost of capital and the cost savings expected to be derived from acquiring an asset these estimates are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and if different estimates were used the purchase price for the acquisition could be allocated to the acquired assets and liabilities differently from the allocation that we have made to the acquired assets and liabilities in addition unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that may affect the accuracy or validity of such estimates and if such events occur we may be required to adjust the value allocated to acquired assets or assumed liabilities 

we also make significant judgments and estimates when we assign useful lives to the definite lived intangible assets identified as part of our acquisitions these estimates are inherently uncertain and if we used different estimates the useful life over which we amortize intangible assets would be different in addition unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that may impact the useful life over which we amortize our intangible assets which would impact our amortization of intangible assets expense and our results of operations 

intangible asset and goodwill impairments 

we assess the impairment of longlived assets including certain intangibles whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that we will not be able to recover an asset groups carrying amount recoverability of an asset group is measured by comparing its carrying amount to the expected future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of that asset group excluding future interest costs that would be recognized as an expense when incurred any impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds its fair market value significant management judgment is required in 

 

we test goodwill for impairment annually or whenever events and changes in circumstances suggest that the carrying amount may not be recoverable the test is performed at the reporting unit level by comparing the reporting units carrying amount including goodwill to the fair value of the reporting unit the fair value of the reporting unit is estimated and if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value goodwill is considered to be impaired and a second step is performed to measure the amount of the impairment loss 

we completed our annual goodwill impairment test during the third quarter of fiscal 2012 and determined that the fair value of our single reporting unit substantially exceeded the carrying amount of our net assets and that no impairment existed 

fair value of financial instruments 

on a quarterly basis we measure at fair value certain financial assets and liabilities including the hedge and embedded conversion derivative associated with the 2625  cash convertible senior notes due 2015 

inputs to valuation techniques are observable or unobservable observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources while unobservable inputs reflect our market assumptions these two types of inputs have created the following fair value hierarchy 

 

this hierarchy requires us to minimize the use of unobservable inputs and to use observable market data if available when determining fair value we recognize transfers between levels of this hierarchy based on the fair values of the respective financial instruments at the end of the reporting period in which the transfer occurred 

the types of instruments that trade in markets that are not considered to be active but are valued based on quoted market prices broker or dealer quotations or alternative pricing sources with reasonable levels of price transparency are generally classified within level 2 of the fair value hierarchy 

certain instruments are classified within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy because they trade infrequently and therefore have little or no price transparency for those instruments that are not traded in active markets or are subject to transfer restrictions valuations are adjusted to reflect illiquidity andor nontransferability and such adjustments are generally based on available market evidence in the absence of such evidence our best estimate is used 

while we believe the observable inputs we use to measure the assets and liabilities included in level 2 and the unobservable inputs we use to measure the assets and liabilities included in level 3 are reasonable different inputs or estimates may materially impact the resulting fair value measurements of these instruments and may also impact our results of operations for an additional description of our fair value measurements see note 8 in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

results of operations 

financial results for fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010 reflect the following 

 revenue 

we primarily generate revenue from licensing our eda software and ip selling or leasing our hardware technology providing maintenance for our software ip and hardware and providing engineering services 

the timing of our product revenue is significantly affected by the mix of hardware and software products in the bookings executed in any given period and whether the revenue for such bookings is recognized over multiple periods or upfront upon completion of delivery 

we seek to achieve a consistent mix of bookings with approximately 90 of the aggregate value of our bookings of a type for which the revenue is recurring or ratable in nature and the remainder of the resulting revenue recognized upfront upon completion of delivery our ability to achieve this bookings mix in any single fiscal quarter may be impacted by an increase in hardware sales beyond our current expectations because product revenue for hardware sales is generally recognized upfront in the quarter in which delivery is completed 

approximately 90  of the aggregate value of our bookings during fiscal 2012 2011 and 2010 was of a type for which the revenue is recurring or ratable in nature 

 we believe our reported revenue and the amount of revenue recognized in future periods will depend on among other things the 

 

revenue mix 

we analyze our software vip and design ip and hardware businesses by product group combining revenues for both product and maintenance because of their interrelationship we have formulated a design solution strategy that combines our design technologies into categories as described in the various product groups below 

functional verification hardware and ip  products in this group including the incisive functional verification platform are used to verify that the highlevel logical representation of an ic design is functionally correct and for verification at the system and soc levels our emulation hardware products vip products memory subsystem models and design ip products are also included in this product group 

custom ic design  our custom design products including the virtuoso custom design platform are used to create ics that must be designed at the transistor level including analog rf memory highperformance digital blocks and standard cell libraries included in this group are specialized verification products that simulate the operation of the design prior to manufacturing the final product of the design flow is a file that describes the various photomasks which are used to manufacture the ic 

digital ic design  products in this group including the encounter digital ic design platform are used to create and convert the highlevel logical representation of a digital ic into a detailed physical blueprint and ultimately produce the detailed design information describing how the ic will be manufactured the final product of the design flow is a file that describes the various photomasks which are used to manufacture the ic 

system interconnect design  this product group consists of our pcb and ic package design products including the allegro and orcad products the allegro system interconnect design platform enables consistent codesign of interconnects across ics ic packages and pcbs while the orcad line focuses on costeffective entrylevel pcb solutions the sigrity signal and power integrity products we acquired during fiscal 2012 are included in this product group 

design for manufacturing  included in the dfm product group are our physical verification manufacturing optimization and layout analysis products these products are used to analyze optimize and verify that the physical blueprint of the ic has been constructed correctly and can be manufactured successfully while our primary focus in dfm is to address manufacturing effects in the upstream digital and custom design flows those products included in this dfm category also are offered separately from our other tools 

for an additional description of our current product strategy see the discussion under the heading products and product strategy under part i item 1 business 

revenue by year 

the following table shows our revenue for fiscal 2012 2011 and 2010 and the change in revenue between years 

  



for software arrangements we generally recognize revenue ratably over the duration of the arrangement and such revenue is allocated between product and maintenance revenue as the duration decreases the percentage of the total contract value that is allocated to maintenance revenue decreases and the percentage allocated to product revenue increases combined product and maintenance revenue increased during fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 primarily because of increased business levels an increase in revenue related to the sale and lease of our hardware products and increased revenue recognized from bookings in prior periods maintenance revenue decreased on a standalone basis during fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 primarily because of the increased allocation to product revenue due to the gradual decline in the average duration of our timebased software license arrangements over the last three years 

product and maintenance revenue increased during fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 due to reasons noted above and also due to the increase in revenue from the denali business which we acquired in the second quarter of 2010 we expect the aggregate of product and maintenance revenue will increase during fiscal 2013 due to increases in the revenue from our software and ip products partially offset by an expected decrease in revenue from our hardware products 

 services revenue decreased during fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 primarily because certain of our design services engineers have been redeployed to internal research and development projects and to assist with presales activities services revenue increased during fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 primarily because of cash collections from customers on orders fulfilled in years prior to 2011 for which revenue was recognized in fiscal 2011 upon receipt of cash payment and because of higher utilization rates for our services personnel 

we expect services revenue to decrease during fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 as we expect certain of our design services engineers will continue to work on internal research and development projects primarily related or our design ip and vip activities 

revenue by product group 

the following table shows the percentage of product and related maintenance revenue contributed by each of our five product groups and services and other during fiscal 2012 2011 and 2010 

  



as described in note 2 in the notes to consolidated financial statements certain of our licensing arrangements allow customers the ability to remix among software products additionally we have arrangements with customers that include a combination of our products with the actual product selection and number of licensed users to be determined at a later date for these arrangements 

we estimate the allocation of the revenue to product groups based upon the expected usage of our products the actual usage of our products by these customers may differ and if that proves to be the case the revenue allocation in the table above would differ 

the changes in the percentage of revenue contributed by the functional verification hardware and ip product group are generally related to changes in revenue related to our hardware products 

revenue by geography 

  



for the primary factors contributing to our increase in revenue across our geographies see the general description under revenue by period above 

revenue by geography as a percent of total revenue 

  



no one customer accounted for 10 or more of total revenue during fiscal 2012 2011 or 2010 

most of our revenue is transacted in the united states dollar however certain revenue transactions are denominated in foreign currencies primarily the japanese yen and we recognize additional revenue from those contracts in periods when the united states dollar weakens in value against the japanese yen and reduced revenue from those contracts in periods when the united states dollar strengthens against the japanese yen for an additional description of how changes in foreign exchange rates affect our consolidated financial statements see the discussion in item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk – foreign currency risk 

cost of revenue 

  

the following table shows cost of revenue as a percentage of related revenue for fiscal 2012 2011 and 2010 

  



cost of product 

cost of product includes costs associated with the sale and lease of our hardware and licensing of our software and ip products cost of product associated with our hardware products includes materials assembly and overhead these additional hardware manufacturing costs make our cost of hardware product higher as a percentage of revenue than our cost of software and ip products cost of product also includes the cost of employee salary benefits and other employeerelated costs including stockbased compensation expense amortization of acquired intangibles directly related to our products as well as the costs of technical documentation and royalties payable to thirdparty vendors 

a summary of cost of product for fiscal 2012 2011 and 2010 is as follows 

  

  

the changes in cost of product were due to the following 



hardware costs increased by 310 million during fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 primarily due to an increase in hardware business amortization of acquired intangibles included in cost of product increased during fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 and during fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 primarily due to an increase in amortization of intangible assets associated with our acquisition of sigrity during fiscal 2012 our fiscal 2011 acquisitions and our acquisition of denali during fiscal 2010 

cost of product depends primarily upon the mix of hardware and software product sales in any given period and also depends upon the timing and extent to which we acquire intangible assets acquire or license thirdparties intellectual property or technology and sell our products that include such acquired or licensed intellectual property or technology for an additional description of our expected amortization of intangible assets see note 5 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

cost of services 

cost of services primarily includes employee salary benefits and other employeerelated costs costs to maintain the infrastructure necessary to manage a services organization and provisions for contract losses if any cost of services decreased by 89 million  during fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 primarily due to a decrease in employee salary benefits and other employeerelated costs certain of our design services engineers have been redeployed to internal research and development projects or to assist with presales activities resulting in lower cost of services expense we expect to continue to deploy our services engineers on internal projects and presales activities there were no significant changes in cost of services during fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 

cost of maintenance 

cost of maintenance includes the cost of our customer support services such as telephone online and onsite support employee salary benefits and other employeerelated costs amortization of acquired intangible assets and documentation of maintenance updates there were no significant changes in cost of maintenance during fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 and during fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 

operating expenses 

our operating expenses include marketing and sales research and development and general and administrative expenses factors that may cause our operating expenses to fluctuate include changes in the number of employees due to hiring acquisitions foreign exchange rates and the impact of our variable compensation programs which are driven by overall operating results our employee salary and other compensationrelated costs increased during fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 and during fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 primarily due to hiring additional employees for our research and development activities the addition of employees from our acquisitions and higher variable compensation resulting from improved business levels 

we expect our operating expenses to increase during fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 primarily due to expected hiring of research and development and sales personnel during fiscal 2013 the addition of employees in these areas throughout fiscal 2012 and from our acquisition of sigrity 

our operating expenses are denominated in various foreign currencies we recognize lower expenses in periods when the united states dollar strengthens in value against other currencies and we recognize higher expenses when the united states dollar weakens against other currencies for an additional description of how changes in foreign exchange rates affect our consolidated financial statements see the discussion in item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk – foreign currency risk 

our operating expenses for fiscal 2012 2011 and 2010 were as follows 

  



our operating expenses as a percentage of total revenue for fiscal 2012 2011 and 2010 were as follows 

  



  

marketing and sales 

the changes in marketing and sales expense were due to the following 

  



the increase in salary benefits and other employeerelated costs during fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 and during fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 is primarily due to higher variable compensation resulting from improved business levels hiring additional employees and the addition of employees from our acquisitions 

we expect marketing and sales expense to increase in fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 primarily due to expected hiring during fiscal 2013 and due to the addition of employees from our acquisition of sigrity during fiscal 2012 

research and development 

  

the changes in research and development expense were due to the following 

  



the increase in salary benefits and other employeerelated costs during fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 and during fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 is primarily due to hiring additional employees for our research and development activities the addition of employees through our acquisitions costs associated with design services engineers redeployed to internal research and development projects and higher variable compensation resulting from improved business levels our research and development expenses also increased during fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 due to an increase in professional engineering services costs related to the continuing development of our products and technologies 

we expect research and development expense to increase during fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 primarily due to expected hiring for our research and development activities during fiscal 2013 and due to the addition of employees from our acquisition of sigrity during fiscal 2012 

general and administrative 

the changes in general and administrative expense were due to the following 

  



we recorded net recoveries of our allowance for doubtful accounts of 66 million  during fiscal 2011 and 165 million  during fiscal 2010 because we collected certain receivables that previously had been included in our allowance for doubtful accounts these recoveries resulted in reductions in our general and administrative expense during fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010 and as a result our general and administrative expense increased for fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2011 we had previously recorded reserves for certain customers based on changes in our assessment of collectibility for those customers the principal factor for the assessment at that time was a general deterioration of economic conditions having a significant impact on certain customers these customers business prospects eventually improved and we were able to collect the majority of those receivables that had previously been reserved resulting in recoveries of previously reserved bad debts 

stockbased compensation 

stockbased compensation expense is recorded within the various components of our costs and expenses stockbased compensation expense increased 40 million  during fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 because of an increase in restricted stock outstanding and higher grant date fair values stockbased compensation did not change significantly during fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 

we expect stockbased compensation to increase during fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 because we expect that new awards granted during fiscal 2013 will have higher grant date fair values compared to grants made in previous years 

amortization of acquired intangibles 



the changes in amortization of acquired intangibles were due to the following 



restructuring and other charges 

we have initiated various restructuring plans in the past with the most recent taking place during fiscal 2010 for an additional description of these restructuring plans see note 16 in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

because the restructuring charges and related benefits are derived from managements estimates made during the formulation of the restructuring plans based on thencurrently available information our restructuring plans may not achieve the benefits anticipated on the timetable or at the level contemplated demand for our products and services and ultimately our future financial performance is difficult to predict with any degree of certainty accordingly additional actions including further restructuring of our operations may be required in the future 

  

the following table presents restructuring and other charges for our restructuring plans 



restructuring and other charges recorded during fiscal 2010 consisted primarily of costs for severance and termination benefits related to our restructuring plans restructuring and other charges credits recorded during fiscal 2012 and 2011 consisted primarily of adjustments to previous estimates of restructuring liabilities 

litigation charges 

in february 2011 we agreed to settle our pending derivative and securities litigation accordingly we recorded litigation charges of 158 million in our fiscal 2010 operating results for an additional description of our legal proceedings and this settlement see note 15 in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

interest expense 

  

other income net 



income taxes 

the following table presents the provision benefit for income taxes and the effective tax rate for fiscal 2012 2011 and 2010 

  

our benefit for income taxes for fiscal 2012 primarily consisted of the following 

 our release of the valuation allowance was based on our determination that the magnitude and history of our united states income our achievement of a consistent multiyear history with approximately 90  of the aggregate value of our bookings being of a type for which revenue is recurring or ratable in nature and our ending backlog of future revenue for the year ended december 29 2012 provided us an objective source of future revenues that allowed us to more heavily weigh our projections of future income and collectively provided us with sufficient positive evidence that it is more likely than not that we will realize a significant amount of our united states deferred tax assets we maintained a valuation allowance of 743 million on certain of our deferred tax assets because the realization of these deferred tax assets require future income of a specific character or amount that we considered uncertain 

our fiscal 2011 provision for income taxes is primarily related to 114 million of tax expense on certain of our foreign subsidiaries 54 million of excess tax benefits from employee stock compensation that were allocated to stockholders equity and 41 million of interest expense on unrecognized tax benefits that was partially offset by 50 million of tax benefit from the release of valuation allowance due to the recognition of deferred tax liabilities resulting from a fiscal 2011 business combination 

our fiscal 2010 benefit for income taxes is primarily related to the decrease in net unrecognized tax benefits and accrued interest of 1479 million as a result of our effective settlement of certain tax matters with the irs in august 2010 and the release of 667 million of valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets primarily due to the recognition of deferred tax liabilities related to the acquisition of intangibles with denali in june 2010 

the american taxpayer relief act of 2012 enacted in january 2013 retroactively extended the united states federal research tax credit from january 1 2012 through december 31 2013 we expect to recognize a periodspecific tax benefit of approximately 58 million for the fiscal 2012 federal research tax credit during our first quarter of fiscal 2013 we may also recognize an additional periodspecific tax benefit of approximately 337 million during the first quarter of fiscal 2013 related to uncertain tax positions recorded in a prior business combination 

for further discussion regarding our income taxes including the status of examinations by tax authorities and considerations related to the establishment or release of valuation allowance see note 6 in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

liquidity and capital resources 

  

cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments 

as of december 29 2012  our principal sources of liquidity consisted of 8271 million  of cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments as compared to 6046 million  as of december 31 2011  

during fiscal 2012 we began to maintain an investment portfolio of approximately 100 million in marketable debt securities including corporate debt securities united states treasury securities united states government agency securities bank certificates of deposit and commercial paper our investments in marketable debt securities are classified as availableforsale and are included in shortterm investments as of december 29 2012  our investments are made in accordance with our cash investment policy 

which governs the amounts and types of investments we hold in our portfolio our investment portfolio could be affected by various risks and uncertainties including credit risk interest rate risk and general market risk as outlined in part i item 1a risk factors 

our primary source of cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments during fiscal 2012 and 2011 was customer payments for products maintenance and services we also received cash from stock purchases under our espp and from the exercise of stock options 

our primary use of cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments during fiscal 2012 and 2011 was payments relating to salaries benefits other employeerelated costs and other operating expenses during fiscal 2012 and 2011 we used cash for our acquisitions including our acquisition of sigrity during fiscal 2012 and to purchase property plant and equipment during fiscal 2011 we also used cash to pay the remaining balance on our 2011 notes and to pay amounts related to the settlement of our securities and derivative litigation 

approximately 50  of our cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments were held by our foreign subsidiaries as of december 29 2012  our intent is to permanently reinvest our earnings from certain foreign operations we do not anticipate we will need to repatriate dividends from foreign operations that are permanently reinvested in order to fund our domestic operations in the event that dividends from foreign operations that are currently permanently reinvested are needed to fund united states liquidity we could be required to accrue and pay additional taxes in order to repatriate these funds for further discussion regarding our income taxes including the unrecognized tax liability for indefinitely reinvested foreign earnings see note 6 in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

on december 12 2012 we entered into a 250 million fiveyear senior secured revolving credit facility borrowings under the credit facility may be used to finance working capital capital expenditures acquisitions and other business purposes any outstanding loans drawn under the credit facility are payable on or before december 12 2017 the credit facility contains customary negative covenants that among other things restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness grant liens make certain investments dispose of certain assets and make certain payments in addition the credit facility contains certain financial covenants that require us to maintain a leverage ratio of not greater than 3 to 1 subject to certain exceptions and requires that we maintain an interest coverage ratio of at least 3 to 1 for an additional description of this revolving credit facility see note 3 in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

as of december 29 2012  we had no outstanding balance on the credit facility 

we expect that current cash cash equivalents and shortterm investment balances cash flows that are generated from operations and cash available under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to meet our working capital other capital and liquidity requirements for at least the next 12 months 

net working capital 

the changes in net working capital were due to the following   



the increase in prepaid expenses and other is primarily due to increases in prepaid income taxes the increase in the current portion of convertible notes is due to the shift of the 2013 convertible notes which mature in december 2013 from a longterm 

liability to a current liability the decrease in deferred revenue and the decrease in accounts receivable result from closer alignment between the timing of our revenue and cash collections and collections of accounts receivable during fiscal 2012 

our 2015 notes are convertible into cash from december 30 2012  through march 30 2013  because our closing stock price exceeded 981  for at least 20  of the last 30  trading days prior to december 29 2012  accordingly the net balance of the 2015 notes of 3088 million  is classified as a current liability on our consolidated balance sheet as of december 29 2012  the 2015 notes were convertible and therefore classified as a current liability as of december 29 2012 and december 31 2011 whereas they were classified as longterm as of january 1 2011 because the stock price conversion condition had not been met in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 the classification of the 2015 notes as a current or longterm liability on the consolidated balance sheet is evaluated at each balance sheet date and may change from time to time depending on whether the stock price conversion condition as described above has been met in a particular fiscal quarter if the note holders elect to convert their 2015 notes prior to maturity any unamortized discount and transaction fees will be expensed at the time of conversion if the entire outstanding principal amount had been converted on december 29 2012  we would have recorded an expense of 469 million  associated with the conversion comprised of 412 million  of unamortized debt discount and 57 million  of unamortized transaction fees 

the classification of the liability associated with the cash conversion feature of the 2015 notes or the 2015 notes embedded conversion derivative and the 2015 notes hedges asset as current or longterm on our consolidated balance sheet corresponds with the classification of the 2015 notes as such we classified the fair value of the 2015 notes embedded conversion derivative as a current liability on our consolidated balance sheets as of december 29 2012  and december 31 2011  we also classified the fair value of the 2015 notes hedges as a current asset on our consolidated balance sheets as of december 29 2012  and december 31 2011  the value of the 2015 notes embedded conversion derivative liability and the value of the 2015 notes hedges asset offset one another and the changes in the fair value of these instruments resulted in no net change to our net working capital as of december 29 2012  and december 31 2011  

if the holders of our 2015 notes elect to convert their notes into cash we would be required to make cash payments of up to 3500 million  prior to the maturity of the 2015 notes in connection with the 2015 notes we entered into the 2015 notes hedges and sold warrants to limit our exposure to the additional cash payments above the 3500 million  principal balance in the event of a cash conversion of the 2015 notes the 2015 notes currently trade at a premium to their ifconverted value and we do not anticipate a conversion of the 2015 notes by the note holders between december 30 2012  and march 30 2013  however if the holders of the 2015 notes elect to convert their notes between december 30 2012  and march 30 2013  we expect to have sufficient cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments and access to our revolving credit facility to fund any payment resulting from a conversion 

for an additional description of our 2015 notes and the conversion terms thereof see note 3 in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

cash flows from operating activities 

cash flows from operating activities during fiscal 2012 2011 and 2010 were as follows 



the changes in cash flows from operating activities were due to the following 

  

cash flows from operating activities include net income adjusted for certain noncash items including a 2404 million  increase in deferred taxes as well as changes in the balances of certain assets and liabilities our cash flows from operating activities are significantly influenced by business levels and the payment terms set forth in our license agreements 

if our customers experience adverse changes in the future are not successful in generating sufficient cash or are precluded from securing financing they may delay purchasing our products and services or they may not be able to pay or may delay payment of accounts receivable that are owed to us although these obligations are generally not cancelable our customers inability to fulfill payment obligations would adversely affect our cash flow additionally our customers may seek to renegotiate preexisting contractual commitments though we have not experienced a material level of defaults any material payment default by our customers or significant reductions in existing contractual commitments would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and cash flows from operations 

in february 2011 all parties to our securities and derivative litigation agreed to settle the litigation during fiscal 2011 we paid 164 million into a securities litigation settlement fund which amount included our portion of the settlement consideration plus accrued interest as of december 31 2011 we had paid and our insurance carriers had paid all amounts specified by the settlement agreement into the securities litigation settlement fund the settlement was approved during fiscal 2012 

we expect to pay an additional 43 million  related to our previous restructuring activities primarily for payments related to vacated facilities net of expected sublease income 

we expect that cash flows from operating activities will fluctuate in future periods due to a number of factors including our operating results and the timing of our billings collections and tax payments 

cash flows from investing activities 

cash flows from investing activities during fiscal 2012 2011 and 2010 were as follows 



the changes in cash flows from investing activities were due to the following 

  

during fiscal 2012 we began to maintain an investment portfolio of approximately 100 million in marketable debt securities the purchases sales and maturities of availableforsale securities during fiscal 2012 are primarily related to this portfolio of marketable debt securities for an additional description of these securities see cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments above 

on july 2 2012 we acquired sigrity for total cash consideration of 785 million  net of cash acquired of 75 million  of which 643 million  was paid at closing and 142 million  was deferred and is conditioned upon certain sigrity shareholders remaining employees of cadence over designated retention periods we recorded expense of 35 million  during fiscal 2012 related to this deferred purchase consideration and will expense the remaining 107 million  over the remaining retention periods and we include these deferred payments as a use of cash for operating activities in the period we make the payments during fiscal 2012 we recorded cash used for investing activities of 643 million  related to the sigrity acquisition 

in june 2010 we acquired denali software inc or denali for cash consideration of 2628  million net of cash acquired of 467  million of which 2502  million was paid at closing and 126 million  was deferred of the 126 million 124 million was paid prior to december 29 2012 for an additional description of our acquisition of denali see note 4 in our notes to consolidated financial statements 

in connection with our business combinations and asset acquisitions completed before december 29 2012  we may be obligated to make payments based on or subject to the satisfaction of certain performance metrics if performance is such that these payments are fully achieved we would be obligated to pay up to an aggregate of 188 million  in cash during the next 40  months 

during fiscal 2013 we expect to use cash for our purchase of cosmic circuits private limited we also expect to continue our other investing activities including purchasing property plant and equipment purchasing intangible assets purchasing software licenses business combinations and making longterm equity investments 

cash flows from financing activities 

cash flows from financing activities during fiscal 2012 2011 and 2010 were as follows 



the changes in cash flows from financing activities were due to the following 

  

during fiscal 2011 we paid the 1500 million remaining principal balance on the 2011 notes in full 

during fiscal 2010 we issued 3500 million principal amount of the 2015 notes concurrently with the issuance of the 2015 notes we entered into the 2015 notes hedges to limit our exposure to the additional cash payments above the principal amount that may become due to the holders of the 2015 notes in separate transactions we also sold warrants or the 2015 warrants to purchase our common stock at a strike price of 1078 per share we used an aggregate of 1872 million of the net proceeds from the issuance of the 2015 notes to purchase in the open market 1000 million principal amount of our 2011 notes and 1000 million principal amount of our 2013 notes and we repurchased approximately 65 million shares of our common stock at a cost of 400 million in a separate transaction during fiscal 2010 we repurchased in the open market 55 million principal amount of our 2013 notes 

for an additional description of our 2011 notes 2013 notes and 2015 notes and the conversion terms thereof see note 3 in the notes to consolidated financial statements and net working capital above during fiscal 2013 we expect to pay the 1445 million remaining principal balance on our 2013 notes upon maturity in december 2013 

the increase in proceeds from the issuance of common stock during fiscal 2012 as compared to 2011 and in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 resulted from an increase in employee participation in our espp an increase in the exercise of stock options and an increase in our stock price 

other factors affecting liquidity and capital resources 

as of december 29 2012  we had convertible notes outstanding with a net liability value of 4468 million  and that mature between december 15 2013 and june 1 2015 the principal maturity value of these convertible notes is 4945 million  the total cash or stock payable upon the early conversion of these notes as determined by the indenture of each security will be their principal amount plus any additional conversion value that would be due upon conversion 

in the case of our 2015 notes we will owe additional cash to the note holders upon early conversion if our stock price exceeds 755 per share we entered into hedges with counterparties to limit our exposure to the additional cash payments above the principal amount of the 2015 notes that may be due to the holders upon conversion in separate transactions we sold warrants or the 2015 warrants with a strike price of 1078  per share although our incremental cash payout exposure above the conversion price is limited by the hedges to the 3500 million  outstanding principal value of the 2015 notes we will experience dilution to our stock and to our diluted earnings per share from the outstanding 2015 warrants to the extent our average closing stock price exceeds 1078  in any fiscal quarter until the 2015 notes are converted and the 2015 warrants are settled 

additionally holders may convert their 2015 notes into cash during any quarter following a quarter in which our stock price closes above 981  for at least 20  of the last 30  trading days while holders of the 2015 notes would have the right to convert their notes if early conversion conditions are met we do not expect holders of the 2015 notes to convert their notes under such circumstances because the economic value to the holders of the notes has exceeded and likely will continue to exceed the cash received upon conversion if the holders of the 2015 notes elect to convert their notes between december 30 2012  and march 30 2013  we expect to have sufficient cash cash equivalents shortterm investments and access to our revolving credit facility to fund any payment resulting from a conversion however if holders of a significant portion of the 2015 notes were to choose to convert at a time in which the notes are convertible it could have a significant negative impact on our cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments and liquidity 

in the case of our 2013 notes we may owe shares of our common stock to the note holders upon conversion if our stock price exceeds 2115 per share we entered into hedges with counterparties to limit our exposure to the dilution that may result from the issuance of shares upon conversion of the 2013 notes in separate transactions we sold warrants with a strike price of 3150  per share we will experience dilution to our stock and to diluted earnings per share from the outstanding warrants to the extent our stock price exceeds 3150  

we expect to fund the maturity of the 2013 notes in december 2013 with our cash on hand and cash flows from operating activities during fiscal 2013 the 2013 notes could become convertible prior to their maturity if certain conversion conditions are met however we do not currently expect any of the conversion conditions to be met prior to the maturity of the 2013 notes we also believe that we will have sufficient cash in future periods as well as access to our revolving credit facility to service the maturities of our 2015 notes but future changes in our cash position cash flows from operating activities cash flows from investing activities cash flows from financing activities as well as general business levels and changes in our access to financing may impact our ability to settle the principal amount payable to the holders of the 2013 notes and 2015 notes when they mature or convert 

for an additional description of the 2015 notes and 2013 notes the conversion terms thereof and the hedge and warrants transactions see note 3 in the notes to consolidated financial statements and net working capital above 

contractual obligations 

a summary of our contractual obligations as of december 29 2012  is as follows 



 

1 with respect to purchase obligations that are cancelable by us the table includes the amount that would have been payable if we had canceled the obligation as of december 29 2012  or the earliest cancellation date 

2  the 2023 notes are due in august 2023 however the holders of the 2023 notes can require us to repurchase for cash the remaining portion of the 2023 notes on august 15 2013 for 10000 of the principal amount therefore we have included  02 million  of principal of the 2023 notes on the potential repurchase of the 2023 notes in the less than 1 year column in the table above 

3 holders of the 2015 notes can convert their 2015 notes into cash during a fiscal quarter if the closing price of our common stock exceeds 981 for at least 20 days in the 30 day period preceding the end of the preceding fiscal quarter this conversion condition was met for the 2015 notes during the three months ended december 29 2012  and the 2015 notes are convertible into cash from december 30 2012  through march 30 2013  accordingly we classified the net balance of the 2015 notes of 3088 million  as a current liability on our consolidated balance sheet as of december 29 2012  in connection with the 2015 notes we entered into the 2015 notes hedges and sold warrants to limit our exposure to the additional cash payments above the 3500 million principal balance in the event of a cash conversion of the 2015 notes the 2015 notes currently trade at a premium to their ifconverted value so we do not anticipate a conversion of the 2015 notes by the note holders between december 30 2012  and march 30 2013  

4 included in other longterm contractual obligations are longterm income tax liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits of 520 million  that we estimate will be paid or settled within 1 to 3 years included in this amount are 425 million of uncertain tax benefits recorded in a prior business combination for which the statute of limitation may expire in the first quarter of fiscal 2013 the remaining portion of other longterm contractual obligations is primarily liabilities associated with defined benefit retirement plans and acquisitionrelated liabilities 

in connection with our acquisitions completed before december 29 2012  we would be obligated to pay up to an aggregate of 188 million  in cash over the next 40  months if certain defined performance goals are achieved in full 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

as of december 29 2012  we did not have any significant offbalance sheet arrangements as defined in item 303a4ii of sec regulation sk 

new accounting standards 

in june 2011 the financial accounting standards board issued new accounting standards regarding the presentation of comprehensive income loss in the financial statements the new standards require presentation of the components of net income loss the components of other comprehensive income loss and total comprehensive income loss either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements these standards eliminated the option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of stockholders equity these standards were effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december 15 2011 and were to be applied retrospectively we adopted these standards as of january 1 2012 and disclosed components of other comprehensive income in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income the adoption of this guidance affected only the presentation of our financial statements and had no impact on our consolidated operating results and financial position 

in september 2011 the fasb issued new accounting standards that allow an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the twostep quantitative goodwill impairment test under these amendments an entity would not be required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless the entity determines based on a qualitative assessment that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount these standards were effective for annual periods beginning after december 15 2011 we adopted these standards as of january 1 2012 and they did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

we periodically review new accounting standards although some of the accounting standards that have been issued may be applicable to us we have not identified any other new accounting standards that would have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

foreign currency risk 

a material portion of our revenue expenses and business activity are transacted in the united states dollar however certain of our operations include transactions in foreign currencies that can affect our results of operations in certain countries where we invoice customers in the local currency japan in particular our revenues benefit from a weaker dollar and are adversely affected by a stronger dollar the opposite impact occurs in countries where we record expenses in local currencies in those cases our operating expenses benefit from a stronger dollar and are adversely affected by a weaker dollar most of our revenue is transacted in united states dollars the fluctuations in our operating expenses outside the united states resulting from volatility in the united states dollar against certain foreign currencies are not generally moderated by corresponding fluctuations in our revenues except for our operations in japan 

we enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts with financial institutions to protect against currency exchange risks associated with existing assets and liabilities a foreign currency forward exchange contract acts as a hedge by increasing in value when underlying assets decrease in value or underlying liabilities increase in value due to changes in foreign exchange rates conversely a foreign currency forward exchange contract decreases in value when underlying assets increase in value or underlying liabilities decrease in value due to changes in foreign exchange rates these forward contracts are not designated as accounting hedges so the unrealized gains and losses are recognized in other income net in advance of the actual foreign currency cash flows with the fair value of these forward contracts being recorded as accrued liabilities or other current assets 

we do not use forward contracts for trading purposes our forward contracts generally have maturities of 90 days or less we enter into currency forward exchange contracts based on estimated future asset and liability exposures and the effectiveness of our hedging program depends on our ability to estimate these future asset and liability exposures recognized gains and losses with respect to our current hedging activities will ultimately depend on how accurately we are able to match the amount of currency forward exchange contracts with actual underlying asset and liability exposures 

the following table provides information about our forward foreign currency contracts as of december 29 2012  the information is provided in united states dollar equivalent amounts the table presents the notional amounts at contract exchange rates and the weighted average contractual foreign currency exchange rates expressed as units of the foreign currency per united states dollar which in some cases may not be the market convention for quoting a particular currency all of these forward contracts mature before or during february 2013    



while we actively monitor our foreign currency risks there can be no assurance that our foreign currency hedging activities will substantially offset the impact of fluctuations in currency exchange rates on our results of operations cash flows and financial position 

interest rate risk 

our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our portfolio of marketable debt securities our portfolio of cash and cash equivalents and outstanding balances drawn on our credit facility if any 

 we are exposed to interest rate fluctuations in many of the worlds leading industrialized countries but the fair value of our marketable debt securities and our interest income and expense is most sensitive to fluctuations in the general level of united states interest rates in this regard changes in united states interest rates affect the interest earned on our marketable debt securities and cash and cash equivalents any unrealized and realized gains or losses on our marketable debt securities and the costs associated with foreign currency hedges pursuant to our investment policy we limit the amount of our credit exposure to any one issuer other than in securities issued by the united states treasury and united states government agencies 

our shortterm investments as of december 29 2012  include 985 million  of marketable debt securities that may decline in value if market interest rates rise such variability in market interest rates may result in a negative impact on the results of our investment activities as of december 29 2012  an increase in the market rates of interest of 1 would result in a decrease in the fair values of our marketable debt securities by approximately 08 million  

all highly liquid securities with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase are considered to be cash equivalents securities with maturities greater than three months are classified as availableforsale and are considered to be shortterm investments the carrying value of our interestbearing instruments approximated fair value as of december 29 2012  

interest rates under our revolving credit facility are variable so interest expense for periods when the credit facility is utilized could be adversely affected by changes in interest rates interest rates under our revolving credit facility can fluctuate based on changes in market interest rates and in an interest rate margin that varies based on our consolidated leverage ratio as of december 29 2012 we had no outstanding balance on the credit facility see note 3 in the notes to consolidated financial statements for an additional description of our credit facility 

equity price risk 

convertible notes 

our 2015 notes and 2013 notes include conversion and settlement provisions that are based on the price of our common stock at conversion or at maturity of the notes in addition the hedges and warrants associated with these convertible notes also include settlement provisions that are based on the price of our common stock the amount of cash we may be required to pay 

or the number of shares we may be required to provide to note holders at conversion or maturity of these notes is determined by the price of our common stock the amount of cash or number of shares that we may receive from hedge counterparties in connection with the related hedges and the number of shares that we may be required to provide warrant counterparties in connection with the related warrants are also determined by the price of our common stock 

upon the expiration of our 2015 warrants cadence will issue shares of common stock to the purchasers of the warrants to the extent our stock price exceeds the warrant strike price of 1078  at that time the following table shows the number of shares that cadence would issue to 2015 warrant counterparties at expiration of the warrants assuming various cadence closing stock prices on the dates of warrant expiration 

  



prior to the expiration of the 2015 warrants for purposes of calculating diluted earnings per share our diluted weightedaverage shares outstanding will increase when our average closing stock price for a quarter exceeds 1078  

for an additional description of our 2015 notes and 2013 notes see note 3 in the notes to consolidated financial statements and liquidity and capital resources – other factors affecting liquidity and capital resources under item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

equity investments 

we have a portfolio of equity investments that includes marketable equity securities and nonmarketable investments our equity investments are made primarily in connection with our strategic investment program under our strategic investment program from time to time we make cash investments in companies with technologies that are potentially strategically important to us see note 9 in the notes to consolidated financial statements for an additional description of these investments our nonmarketable investments had a carrying value of 73 million  as of december 29 2012  and 105 million  as of december 31 2011  




 item 9 changes in and disagreements with accountants on accounting and financial disclosure 

none 




 item 9a controls and procedures 

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

as required by rule 13a15 of the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended or the exchange act under the supervision and with the participation of our management including our chief executive officer or ceo and our chief financial officer or cfo we evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rules 13a15e and 15d15e under the exchange act as of december 29 2012  

the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures included a review of our processes and the effect on the information generated for use in this annual report on form 10k in the course of this evaluation we sought to identify any material weaknesses in our disclosure controls and procedures to determine whether we had identified any acts of fraud involving personnel who have a significant role in our disclosure controls and procedures and to confirm that any necessary corrective action including process improvements was taken this type of evaluation is done every fiscal quarter so that our conclusions concerning the effectiveness of these controls can be reported in our periodic reports filed with the sec the overall goals of these evaluation activities are to monitor our disclosure controls and procedures and to make modifications as necessary we intend to maintain these disclosure controls and procedures modifying them as circumstances warrant 

based on their evaluation as of december 29 2012  our ceo and cfo have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by us in our reports filed or submitted under the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the secs rules and forms and is accumulated and communicated to our management including the ceo and cfo as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure 

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the fiscal quarter ended december 29 2012  that materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting 

inherent limitations on effectiveness of controls 

our management including our ceo and cfo does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud internal control over financial reporting no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of internal control are met further the design of internal control must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of the control must be considered relative to their costs while our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance of their effectiveness because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within cadence have been detected 

managements report on internal control over financial reporting 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rule 13a15f under the exchange act our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 29 2012  in making this assessment our management used the criteria established in internal controlintegrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission our management has concluded that as of december 29 2012  our internal control over financial reporting is effective based on these criteria our independent registered public accounting firm kpmg llp has issued an attestation report on our internal control over financial reporting which is included in part iv item 15 exhibits and financial statement schedules

factors driving the electronic design automation industry 

we deliver products and services that allow our customers to develop highly complex electronics systems and integrated circuit or ic products the electronic design automation or eda industry depends on continued investment by semiconductor and electronics systems companies in new designs and new products according to a leading industry source the semiconductor industry grew in 2010 but did not materially grow overall in 2011 research firms are anticipating that 2012 semiconductor revenues will grow on average by 5 which we believe may drive moderate growth for the eda industry 

  

in order to be competitive and profitable in the pricesensitive markets they serve our customers demand high levels of productivity from their design teams better predictability in their development schedules and high quality products semiconductor and electronics systems companies are responding to demand for increased functionality and miniaturization by combining subsystems — such as radio frequency or rf wireless communication video signal processing and microprocessors — onto a single silicon chip creating a systemonchip or soc or combining multiple chips into a single chip package in a format referred to as systeminpackage or sip the trend toward subsystem integration have required these chip makers to find solutions to challenges previously addressed by system companies such as verifying systemlevel functionality and hardwaresoftware interoperability 

our offerings address many of the challenges associated with developing unique silicon circuitry integrating that circuitry with design ip developed by us or third parties to create socs and combining ics and socs with software to create electronic systems our strategy is to provide our customers with the ability to address the broad range of issues that arise at the silicon soc and system levels 

the most significant issues that our customers face in creating their products include optimizing energy consumption manufacturing microscopic circuitry verifying device functionality and achieving technical performance targets all while meeting aggressive cost requirements our semiconductor and systems customers deliver a wide range of products in segments such as smart phones tablets televisions communications and internet infrastructure and computing platforms providers of eda solutions must deliver products that address the technical challenges while improving the productivity predictability reliability and profitability of the design processes and products of their customers 

products and product strategy 

our products are engineered to improve our customers’ design productivity and design quality by providing a comprehensive set of eda solutions and a differentiated portfolio of design ip and vip product revenues include all fees earned from granting licenses to use our software and ip and from sales and leases of our hardware products see “product licensing arrangements” for a discussion of our license types 

we combine our products and technologies into categories related to major design activities 

 

     the major cadence ® design platforms are branded as incisive ® functional verification encounter ® digital ic design virtuoso ® custom design and allegro ® system interconnect design our functional verification offerings include vip products and are supplemented by our design ip offerings in addition we augment these platform product offerings with a set of dfm products that service both the digital and custom ic design flows 

the products and technologies included in these categories are combined with services readytouse packages of technologies assembled from our broad portfolio and other associated components that provide comprehensive solutions for low power mixed signal and advancednode designs as well as popular designs based on intellectual property owned and licensed by arm holdings plc these solutions and their constituent elements are marketed to users who specialize in areas such as system design and verification functional verification logic design digital implementation custom ic design and printed circuit board or pcb and ic package and sip design 

digital ic design 

digital ic design offerings are used by our customers to create logical representations of a digital circuit or an ic that can be verified for correctness prior to implementation see the discussion under the functional 

  

verification section below once the logic is verified the design representation is implemented or converted to a format ready for silicon manufacturing using additional software tools within this category the manufacturing representation is also analyzed and verified see the discussion under the design for manufacturing section below our digital ic offerings include two major categories logic design and physical implementation 

our logic design offering is comprised of formal verification equivalency checking synthesis and test capabilities within the encounter digital ic design platform and are typically used by customers in conjunction with certain functional verification capabilities this offering provides chip planning design verification and test technologies and services to customers logic design capabilities are aggregated into solutions that address our customers’ needs in areas such as power efficiency and advanced process nodes 

our physical implementation offering is comprised of a range of the encounter digital ic design platform capabilities the physical implementation offering includes timing analysis signal integrity power analysis extraction physical verification and place and route capabilities within the encounter digital ic design platform this offering enables customers to create a physical representation of logic models analyze electrical and physical characteristics of a design and prepare a design for manufacturing 

functional verification and design ip 

functional verification products are used by our customers to efficiently and effectively verify that the circuitry they have designed will perform as intended this is accomplished in advance of actually implementing or manufacturing the circuitry which reduces the risk of discovering an error in the completed product our functional verification offerings are comprised of three major categories logic verification system design and verification and design ip 

our logic verification offering consists of planning property checking testbench simulation vip memory models and environment capabilities within the incisive functional verification platform this offering enables our customers to employ methodologydriven enterpriselevel verification process automation including metricdriven verification planning process tracking and management that allow the coordination of verification activities across multiple teams and various specialists for rapid verification planning and closure

our design ip offerings consist of verified standardsbased functional blocks which customers integrate into their ics to accelerate the development process cadence offers many types of design ip — both controllers and physical connections phy — for protocols such as ethernet pci express ddr and nand flash memory controllers 

the products obtained through the 2010 acquisition of denali software inc or denali including vip memory models and design ip are included in this category of our offerings 

custom ic design 

custom ic design and verification offerings are used by our customers to create schematic representations of circuits down to the transistor level for analog mixedsignal custom digital memory and rf designs these logical representations are verified using simulation tools optimized for each type of design the offering includes the environment ic layout and simulation capabilities within the virtuoso custom design platform other tools in the custom ic portfolio are used to prepare the designs for manufacturing 

  

design for manufacturing 

our primary focus in dfm is to address manufacturing effects as early in the product development process as possible as a result we are enhancing the dfm awareness of our core encounter digital ic and virtuoso custom ic product offerings in addition to upstream integration of dfm technologies we also offer standalone dfm products 

with the advent of silicon manufacturing technologies at geometries of 65 nanometer and below our customers are concerned with the manufacturability and yield of their designs the physical layout of each ic requires detailed analysis and optimization to ensure that the design can be manufactured in volume while performing as expected some of our dfm capabilities include electrical and physical lithography checking chemicalmechanical polishing analysis and optimization pattern matching double patterning and optical proximity checking 

system interconnect design 

our system interconnect design offerings are used by our customers to develop pcbs and ic packages the offerings include the following capabilities within the allegro system interconnect design platform pcb authoring and implementation ic package  sip signal and power integrity analysis pcb library design management and collaboration certain offerings also include the simulation capability within the virtuoso custom design platform these offerings enable engineers who are responsible for the capture layout and analysis of advanced pcb and ic packages to design highperformance electronic products across the domains of ic ic package and pcb to increase functional density and to manage design complexity while reducing cost and time to market for the mainstream pcb customers where individual or small team productivity is a focus we provide the orcad ® family of offerings that is marketed worldwide through a network of resellers 

thirdparty programs and initiatives 

in addition to our products many customers use internally developed design tools or design tools provided by other eda companies as well as design ip available from multiple suppliers we support the use of thirdparty design products and design ip through vehicles such as our connections ® program and through our participation in industry groups such as the silicon integration initiative and acellera system initiative we contribute to the development and deployment of eda industry standards

product maintenance and services revenue 

revenue and revenue as a percentage of total revenue from our product services and maintenance offerings for the last three fiscal years were as follows 

 

 for an additional description of our product services and maintenance revenue see the discussion under the heading “results of operations” under item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” 

marketing and sales 

we generally market our products and provide maintenance and services to existing and prospective customers through a direct sales force consisting of sales people and applications engineers applications engineers provide technical presales and postsales support for software products due to the complexity of many of our eda products and the electronic design process the sales cycle is generally long requiring three to six months or more during the sales cycle our direct sales force generally provides technical presentations product demonstrations and support for onsite customer evaluation of our solutions we also promote our products and services through advertising direct mail trade shows public relations and the internet we selectively utilize valueadded resellers to broaden our reach and reduce cost of sales all orcad and selected incisive products are primarily marketed through these channels with respect to international sales we generally market and support our products and services through our subsidiaries we also use a thirdparty distributor to sell our products and services to certain customers in japan 

product arrangements 

we sell software using three license types subscription term and perpetual customers who prefer to license technology for a specified limited period of time will choose either a subscription or term license and customers who prefer to have the right to use the technology continuously without time restriction will choose a perpetual license customers who desire to use new software technology during the life of the contract will select a subscription license which allows them limited access to unspecified new technology on a whenandifavailable basis as opposed to a term or perpetual license which does not include rights to use new technology payment terms for subscription and term licenses generally provide for payments to be made in installments over the license period and payment terms for perpetual licenses generally are net 30 days 

  

our hardware products are either sold to customers or leased to them 

we generally license our design ip under nonexclusive license agreements that provide usage rights for specific applications fees under these licenses are typically charged on a perdesign basis 

for a further description of our license agreements our hardware sale or lease agreements revenue recognition policies and results of operations please refer to the discussion under the heading “critical accounting estimates” under item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” 

backlog 

our backlog was approximately 17 billion as of both december 31 2011 and january 1 2011 although our total backlog as of december 31 2011 has not changed significantly from the balance as of january 1 2011 we believe our backlog has improved because our backlog as of december 31 2011 contained contracts with a shorter weightedaverage duration our backlog as of december 31 2011 consisted of revenue to be recognized in fiscal periods after december 31 2011 for fully executed arrangements with effective dates commencing no later than december 31 2011 and from a variety of license types which generally include but are not limited to 

 

      the substantial majority of our backlog is generated by our product and maintenance businesses because customer licenses generally include both product and maintenance components historically we have not experienced significant cancellations of our contracts with customers however we occasionally reschedule the required completion dates of engineering services contracts deferring revenue recognition under those contracts beyond the original anticipated completion date changes in customer license types or payment terms also can affect the timing of revenue recognition during fiscal 2011 approximately 75 of our revenue came from backlog as of january 1 2011 we expect approximately 80 of our fiscal 2012 revenue to come from backlog as of december 31 2011 the actual percentage of revenue coming from backlog in fiscal 2012 may change if our actual business levels in fiscal 2012 are different than our current expectations 

revenue seasonality 

as a result of our transition to a more ratable license mix our overall exposure to short term revenue seasonality has generally been reduced 

research and development 

our research and development expense was 4007 million during fiscal 2011 3764 million during fiscal 2010 and 3547 million during fiscal 2009 

the primary areas of our research and development include soc design the design of silicon devices highperformance ic packaging sip and pcb design systemlevel modeling and verification highperformance logic verification technology vip design ip and hardwaresoftware coverification the electronics industry combines rapid innovation with rapidly increasing design and manufacturing complexity so we make significant investments in enhancing our current products as well as creating new products and technologies and integrating those products and technologies together into differing solutions 

our future performance depends largely on our ability to maintain and enhance our current product development and commercialization of newly developed products or capabilities and to offer solutions that meet increasingly demanding productivity quality predictability and cost requirements our offerings must keep pace with our customers’ technical developments and industry standards 

  

manufacturing and software distribution 

we perform final assembly and testing of our verification acceleration and emulation hardware products at our headquarters in san jose california subcontractors manufacture all major subassemblies including all individual pcbs and custom ics and supply them for qualification and testing before their incorporation into the assembled product 

software and documentation are primarily distributed to customers by secure electronic delivery or on dvd 

proprietary technology 

our success depends in part upon our proprietary technology we generally rely on patents copyrights trademarks and trade secret laws licenses and restrictive agreements to establish and protect our proprietary rights in technology and products many of our products include software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties we may have to seek new licenses or renew existing licenses for thirdparty software and other intellectual property in the future as part of performing engineering services for customers our engineering services business uses certain software and other intellectual property licensed from third parties including that of our competitors 

competition 

we compete in eda software products and maintenance most frequently with synopsys inc mentor graphics corporation and magma design automation inc but also with numerous other eda providers such as ansys inc atrenta inc atoptech inc berkeley design automation inc eve sa springsoft inc and zuken ltd and many others offering “point solutions” with manufacturers of electronic devices that have developed acquired or have the capability to develop their own eda products and with numerous electronics design and consulting companies synopsys recently closed its acquisition of magma which will impact the competitive landscape of the industry in the area of design ip we compete with synopsys and numerous smaller ip companies we generally compete on the basis of quality product features level of integration or compatibility with other tools price payment terms and maintenance offerings 

it is our strategy to use engineering services as a differentiator to further promote our products and maintenance businesses certain competitive factors in the engineering services business differ from those of the products and maintenance businesses while we do compete with other eda companies in the engineering services business our principal competitors include independent engineering service businesses these companies vary greatly in focus geographic location capability cost structure and pricing business models of these companies range from servicesonly engineering work to delivery of completed ics many of these companies are also customers and therefore use our product offerings in the delivery of their services or products we compete with these companies by focusing on the design of complex analog digital and mixedsignal ics and socs 

international operations 

we have 48 sales offices design centers and research and development facilities approximately 60 of which are located outside of the united states we consider customer sales and support requirements the availability of a skilled workforce and costs and efficiencies among other relative benefits when determining what operations to locate internationally for an additional description of our international operations see the discussion under the heading “the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations and other risks to our international operations may seriously harm our financial condition” under item 1a “risk factors” and note 21 in our notes to consolidated financial statements 

employees

 item 1a risk factors 

our business faces many risks described below under the headings “risks related to our business” and “risks related to our securities and indebtedness” are what we believe to be the material risks that we face if any of the events or circumstances described in the following risks actually occurs our business financial condition or results of operations could suffer 

risks related to our business 

uncertainty in the global economy in general and any potential downturn in the semiconductor and electronics industries in particular may negatively impact our business and reduce our bookings levels and revenue 

purchases of our products and services are dependent upon the commencement of new design projects by ic manufacturers and electronics systems companies the ic and electronics systems industries are cyclical and are characterized by constant and rapid technological change rapid product obsolescence and price erosion evolving standards short product life cycles and wide fluctuations in product supply and demand 

for example the ic and electronics systems industries experienced a significant downturn in 2009 the ic and electronic systems industries have also experienced significant downturns in connection with or in anticipation of maturing product cycles of both these industries’ and their customers’ products this economic downturn in the industries we serve contributed to the reduction in our revenue in 2009 as compared to prior years although the semiconductor industry experienced growth in 2010 semiconductor industry revenues for 2011 remained at levels similar to 2010 spending on eda products and services during 2012 may grow moderately as customers invest in new projects or spending on eda products and services may decline in 2012 

while we cannot predict global economic conditions uncertainty about future economic conditions and future decline in consumer spending could negatively impact our customers’ businesses reducing the number of new chip designs their overall research and development spending including their spending on eda products and services and as a result decrease demand for our products decreased bookings for our products and services customer bankruptcies or consolidation among our customers could also adversely affect our ability to grow our business our future business and financial results are subject to considerable uncertainty that could impact our stock price if economic conditions deteriorate in the future or in particular if semiconductor industry revenues do not grow our future revenues and financial results could be adversely affected however if economic conditions improve for our customers the positive impact on our revenues and financial results may be deferred due to cautious customer research and development spending and our ratable license mix 

we have experienced varied operating results and our operating results for any particular fiscal period are affected by the timing of significant bookings for our products fluctuations in customer preferences for license types and the timing of revenue recognition under those license types 

we have recorded net losses in the past and may record net losses in the future various factors affect our operating results and some of them are not within our control our operating results for any period are affected by the timing of certain bookings for our software and hardware products and by bookings levels 

our operating results are also affected by the mix of software license types and bookings for sales of hardware products executed in any given period revenue is affected by the timing of software license renewals changes in existing contractual arrangements with customers and the mix of license types ie perpetual term or subscription for existing customers our software license mix is such that a substantial proportion of licenses require ratable revenue recognition and we expect the license mix combined with the modest growth in 

  

spending by our customers in the semiconductor sector may make it difficult for us to rapidly increase our revenue in future fiscal periods the timing of our revenue recognition may be deferred until payments become due and payable from customers with nonlinear payment terms or as cash is collected from customers with low credit ratings 

revenue related to our hardware business is generally recognized upon delivery we expect revenue related to our hardware business to be cyclical with our hardware related revenue generally increasing after the release of a new generation of hardware products and then declining gradually as that generation of hardware systems gets older until eventually a new generation of hardware products is released and the cycle restarts any variation from these expectations could have a material impact on our business 

we plan our operating expenses based on forecasted revenue expected business needs and other factors these expenses and the effect of longterm commitments are relatively fixed in the short term bookings and the related revenue are harder to forecast in a difficult economic environment if the macroeconomic environment weakens and we experience a shortfall in bookings our operating results could differ from our expectations because we may not be able to quickly reduce our expenses in response to shortterm business changes 

the methods estimates and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies have a significant impact on our results of operations see “critical accounting estimates” under part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” such methods estimates and judgments are by their nature subject to substantial risks uncertainties and assumptions and factors may arise over time that may lead us to change our methods estimates and judgments changes in those methods estimates and judgments could significantly affect our results of operations 

you should not view our historical results of operations as reliable indicators of our future performance if our revenue operating results or business outlook for future periods fall short of the levels expected by securities analysts or investors the trading price of our common stock could decline 

our failure to respond quickly to technological developments or customers’ increasing technological requirements could make our products uncompetitive and obsolete 

the industries in which we compete experience rapid technology developments changes in industry standards and customer requirements and frequent new product introductions and improvements currently the industries we serve are experiencing the following trends 

 

      

   if we are unable to respond quickly and successfully to these trends we may lose our competitive position and our products or technologies may become uncompetitive or obsolete to compete successfully we must develop acquire or license new products and improve our existing products and processes on a schedule that keeps pace with technological developments and the requirements for products addressing a broad spectrum of designers and designer expertise in our industries our hardware platforms must be enhanced periodically to reduce the likelihood that a competitor surpasses the capabilities we offer we must also be able to support a range of changing computer software hardware platforms and customer preferences a rapid transition to different business models associated with cloud computing technologies could result in reduced revenue we cannot guarantee that we will be successful in keeping pace with all or any of the customer trends 

our stock price has been subject to significant fluctuations and may continue to be subject to fluctuations 

the market price of our common stock has experienced significant fluctuations and may fluctuate or decline in the future and as a result you could lose the value of your investment the market price of our common stock may be affected by a number of factors including but not limited to 

 

        in addition equity markets in general and the equities of technology companies in particular have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations such price and volume fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock for reasons unrelated to our business or operating results 

litigation could adversely affect our financial condition or operations 

we currently are and in the future may be involved in various disputes and litigation that arise in the ordinary course of business these include disputes and lawsuits related to intellectual property including customer indemnification mergers and acquisitions licensing contracts distribution arrangements and employee relations matters we have been engaged in a consolidated securities class action lawsuit and shareholder derivative lawsuits for information regarding the litigation matters in which we are currently engaged please refer to the discussion under item 3 “legal proceedings” and note 16 in our notes to consolidated financial statements we cannot provide any assurances that the final outcome of these lawsuits or any other proceedings that may arise in the future will not have a material adverse effect on our business operating results financial condition or cash flows litigation can be time consuming and expensive and could divert management’s time and attention from our business which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and operating results 

our future revenue is dependent in part upon our installed customer base continuing to license or buy additional products renew maintenance agreements and purchase additional services 

our installed customer base has traditionally generated additional new license service and maintenance revenues in future periods customers may not necessarily license or buy additional products or contract for 

  

additional services or maintenance in some cases maintenance is renewable annually at a customer’s option and there are no mandatory payment obligations or obligations to license additional software if our customers decide not to renew their maintenance agreements or license additional products or contract for additional services or if they reduce the scope of the maintenance agreements our revenue could decrease which could have an adverse effect on our operating results our customers many of which are large semiconductor and systems companies often have significant bargaining power in negotiations with us mergers or acquisitions of our customers can reduce the total level of purchases of our software and services and in some cases increase customers’ bargaining power in negotiations with their suppliers including us 

the competition in our industries is substantial and we may not be able to continue to successfully compete in our industries 

the eda industry and the commercial electronics engineering services industry are highly competitive if we fail to compete successfully in these industries it could seriously harm our business operating results or financial condition to compete in these industries we must identify and develop or acquire innovative and costcompetitive eda products integrate them into platforms and market them in a timely manner we must also gain industry acceptance for our engineering services and offer better strategic concepts technical solutions prices and response time or a combination of these factors than those of our competitors and the internal design departments of electronics manufacturers we may not be able to compete successfully in these industries factors that could affect our ability to succeed include 

 

       we compete in eda software products and maintenance most frequently with synopsys inc mentor graphics corporation and magma design automation inc but also with numerous other eda providers such as ansys inc atrenta inc atoptech inc berkeley design automation inc eve sa springsoft inc and zuken ltd and many others offering “point solutions” with manufacturers of electronic devices that have developed acquired or have the capability to develop their own eda products and with numerous electronics design and consulting companies synopsys recently closed its acquisition of magma which will impact the competitive landscape of the industry in the area of design ip we compete with synopsys and numerous smaller ip companies 

we may need to change our pricing models to compete successfully competitive pressures could constrain the prices we can charge for our products which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

the highly competitive markets in which we do business can put pressure on us to reduce the prices of our products if our competitors offer deep discounts on certain products in an effort to recapture or gain market share or to sell other software or hardware products we may then need to lower our prices or offer other 

  

favorable terms to compete successfully any such changes would be likely to reduce our profit margins and could adversely affect our operating results any substantial changes to our prices and pricing policies could cause sales and software license revenues to decline or be delayed as our sales force implements and our customers adjust to the new pricing policies some of our competitors may bundle products for promotional purposes or as a longterm pricing strategy or provide guarantees of prices and product implementations these practices could over time significantly constrain the prices that we can charge for our products if we cannot offset price reductions with a corresponding increase in the number of sales or with lower spending then the reduced license revenues resulting from lower prices could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

risks associated with our international operations could seriously harm our financial condition 

a significant amount of our revenue is derived from our international operations and we have offices throughout the world including key research and development facilities outside of the united states our international operations may also be subject to other risks including 

 

           some of our international research and development and other facilities are in parts of the world that are not as politically stable as the united states consequently we may face a greater risk of business interruption as a result of terrorist acts or military conflicts than businesses located domestically furthermore this potential harm is exacerbated because damage to or disruptions at our international research and development facilities could have a more significant adverse effect on our ability to develop new or improve existing products than other businesses that may only have sales offices or other less critical operations abroad we are not insured for losses or interruptions caused by acts of war furthermore our operations are dependent upon the connectivity of our operations throughout the world activities that interfere with our international connectivity such as cyber hacking the introduction of a virus into our computer systems or natural disasters near any of our international locations could significantly interfere with our business operations 

in addition internal controls policies and procedures and employee training and compliance programs that we have implemented to deter prohibited practices may not prevent our employees contractors or agents from violating or circumventing our policies and the laws and regulations applicable to our worldwide operations 

we depend upon our management team and key employees and our failure to attract train motivate and retain management and key employees may make us less competitive in our industries and therefore harm our results of operations 

our business depends upon the continued services efforts and abilities of our senior management including our chief executive officer and other key employees including key development personnel competition for highly skilled executive officers and employees can be intense particularly in geographic areas recognized as high technology centers such as the silicon valley area where our principal offices are located and in other locations where we maintain facilities we may also experience increased compensation costs that are not offset by either improved productivity or higher sales we may not be successful in recruiting new personnel and in retaining and motivating existing personnel from time to time there may be changes in our management team resulting from the hiring and departure of executive officers and as a result we may experience disruption to our 

  

business that may harm our operating results and our relationships with our employees customers and suppliers may be adversely affected to attract retain and motivate individuals with the requisite expertise we may be required to grant large numbers of stock options or other stockbased incentive awards which may be dilutive to existing stockholders and increase compensation expense and pay significant base salaries and cash bonuses which could harm our operating results the high cost of training new employees not fully utilizing these employees or losing trained employees to competing employers could also reduce our operating margins and harm our business or operating results 

in addition the nasdaq marketplace rules require stockholder approval for new equity compensation plans and significant amendments to existing equity compensation plans including increases in shares available for issuance under such plans and prohibit nasdaq member organizations from giving a proxy to vote on equity compensation plans unless the beneficial owner of the shares has given voting instructions these regulations could make it more difficult for us to grant equity compensation to employees in the future to the extent that these regulations make it more difficult or expensive to grant equity compensation to employees we may incur increased compensation costs or find it difficult to attract retain and motivate employees which could materially and adversely affect our business 

we may not receive significant revenue from our current research and development efforts for several years if at all 

developing eda technology and integrating acquired technology into existing platforms is expensive and these investments often require a long time to generate returns our strategy involves significant investments in research and development and related product opportunities we believe that we must continue to dedicate a significant amount of resources to our research and development efforts to maintain and improve our competitive position however we cannot ensure that we will receive significant if any revenue from these investments 

we have acquired and expect to acquire other companies and businesses and may not realize the expected benefits of these acquisitions 

we have acquired and expect to acquire other companies and businesses in the future while we expect to carefully analyze each potential acquisition before committing to the transaction we may not consummate any particular transaction but may nonetheless incur significant costs or if a transaction is consummated we may not be able to integrate and manage acquired products and businesses effectively or to integrate and retain key personnel from the acquired companies or businesses in addition acquisitions involve a number of risks if any of the following acquisitionrelated risks occur our business operating results or financial condition could be seriously harmed 

 

         in a number of our completed acquisitions we have agreed to make future payments either in the form of employee bonuses or contingent purchase price payments based on the performance of the acquired businesses or 

  

the employees who joined us with the acquired businesses we may continue to use contingent purchase price payments in connection with acquisitions in the future the performance goals pursuant to which these future payments may be made generally relate to achievement by the acquired business or by the employees who joined us with the acquired business of certain specified bookings revenue run rate product proliferation product development or employee retention goals during a specified period following completion of the applicable acquisition future acquisitions may involve issuances of stock as full or partial payment of the purchase price for the acquired business grants of incentive stock or options to employees of the acquired businesses which may be dilutive to existing stockholders expenditure of substantial cash resources or the incurrence of material amounts of debt 

the specific performance goal levels and amounts and timing of employee bonuses or contingent purchase price payments vary with each acquisition while we expect to derive value from an acquisition in excess of such contingent payment obligations our strategy may change and we may be required to make certain contingent payments without deriving the anticipated value 

we rely on our proprietary technology as well as software and other intellectual property rights licensed to us by third parties and we cannot assure you that the precautions taken to protect our rights will be adequate or that we will continue to be able to adequately secure such intellectual property rights from third parties 

our success depends in part upon our proprietary technology we generally rely on patents copyrights trademarks trade secret laws licenses and restrictive agreements to establish and protect our proprietary rights in technology and products despite the precautions we may take to protect our intellectual property third parties have tried in the past and may try in the future to challenge invalidate or circumvent these safeguards our patents or other intellectual property rights may not provide us with sufficient competitive advantages patents may not be issued on any of our pending applications and our issued patents may not be sufficiently broad to protect our technology furthermore the laws of foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights in those countries to the same extent as applicable law protects these rights in the united states the protection of our intellectual property may require the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources moreover the steps we take to protect our intellectual property may not adequately protect our rights deter or prevent third parties from infringing or misappropriating our proprietary rights 

many of our products include software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties we may have to seek new or renew existing licenses for such software and other intellectual property in the future our engineering services business holds licenses to certain software and other intellectual property owned by third parties including that of our competitors our failure to obtain software other intellectual property licenses or other intellectual property rights that are necessary or helpful for our business on favorable terms or our need to engage in litigation over these licenses or rights could seriously harm our business operating results or financial condition 

we could suffer serious harm to our business because of the infringement of our intellectual property rights by third parties or because of our infringement of the intellectual property rights of third parties 

there are numerous eda vip and design ip productrelated patents new patents are being issued at a rapid rate and are owned by eda companies as well as entities and individuals outside the eda industry including parties whose income is primarily derived from infringementrelated litigation it is not always practicable to determine in advance whether a product or any of its components infringes the patent rights of others as a result from time to time we may be compelled to respond to or prosecute intellectual property infringement claims to protect our rights or defend a customer’s rights 

intellectual property infringement claims including contractual defense reimbursement obligations related to thirdparty claims against our customers regardless of merit could consume valuable management time result in costly litigation or cause product shipment delays all of which could seriously harm our business operating 

  

results or financial condition the risk of infringement and related indemnification claims associated with design ip products that are incorporated into a customer product broadly used by consumers may be higher than the risk associated with our software products in settling these claims we may be required to enter into royalty or licensing agreements with the third parties claiming infringement these royalty or licensing agreements if available may not have terms favorable to us being compelled to enter into a license agreement with unfavorable terms could seriously harm our business operating results or financial condition any potential intellectual property litigation could compel us to do one or more of the following 

 

    if we were compelled to take any of these actions our business or operating results may suffer 

if our security measures are breached and an unauthorized party obtains access to customer data or our proprietary business information our information systems may be perceived as being unsecure which could harm our business and reputation 

our products and services involve the storage and transmission of our proprietary information and that of our customers we have offices throughout the world including key research and development facilities outside of the united states our operations are dependent upon the connectivity of our operations throughout the world despite our security measures our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to cyber attacks or breached due to an employee error or other disruption that could result in unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information and could significantly interfere with our business operations breaches of our security measures could expose us to a risk of loss or misuse of this information litigation and potential liability because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage information systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventive measures in addition if we select a vendor that uses cyber storage of information as part of their service or product offerings despite our attempts to validate the security of such services our proprietary information may be misappropriated by third parties in the event of an actual or perceived breach of our security or the security of one of our vendors the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed and we could suffer damage to our reputation or our business or lose existing customers and lose our ability to obtain new customers 

the long sales cycle of our products and services makes the timing of our revenue difficult to predict and may cause our operating results to fluctuate unexpectedly 

generally we have a long sales cycle that can extend up to six months or longer the complexity and expense associated with our products and services generally require a lengthy customer education evaluation and approval process consequently we may incur substantial expenses and devote significant management effort and expense to develop potential relationships that do not result in agreements or revenue and may prevent us from pursuing other opportunities 

in addition sales of our products and services have been and may in the future be delayed if customers delay approval or commencement of projects because of 

 

  long sales cycles for acceleration and emulation hardware products subject us to a number of significant risks over which we have limited control including insufficient excess or obsolete inventory variations in inventory valuation and fluctuations in quarterly operating results 

  

the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations may adversely impact our financial condition 

we have significant operations outside the united states our revenue from international operations as a percentage of total revenue was approximately 57 during fiscal 2011 59 during fiscal 2010 and 57 during fiscal 2009 a substantial portion of which is denominated in united states dollars we expect that revenue from our international operations will continue to account for a significant portion of our total revenue we also transact business in various foreign currencies primarily the japanese yen the volatility of foreign currencies in certain regions most notably the japanese yen european union euro british pound and indian rupee have had and may in the future have an effect on our revenue or operating results 

fluctuations in the rate of exchange between the united states dollar and the currencies of other countries where we conduct business could seriously affect our business operating results or financial condition for example when a foreign currency declines in value relative to the united states dollar it takes more of the foreign currency to purchase the same amount of united states dollars than before the change if we price our products and services in the foreign currency we receive fewer united states dollars than we did before the change if we price our products and services in united states dollars the decrease in value of the local currency results in an increase in the price for our products and services compared to those products of our competitors that are priced in local currency this could result in our prices being uncompetitive in markets where business is transacted in the local currency on the other hand when a foreign currency increases in value relative to the united states dollar it takes more united states dollars to purchase the same amount of the foreign currency as we use the foreign currency to pay for payroll costs and other operating expenses in our international operations this results in an increase in operating expenses 

exposure to foreign currency transaction risk can arise when transactions are conducted in a currency different from the functional currency of one of our subsidiaries a subsidiary’s functional currency is generally the currency in which it primarily conducts its operations including product pricing expenses and borrowings although we attempt to reduce the effect of foreign currency fluctuations significant exchange rate movements may hurt our results of operations as expressed in united states dollars 

our reported financial results may be adversely affected by changes in united states generally accepted accounting principles 

united states generally accepted accounting principles are subject to interpretation by the financial accounting standards board or fasb the american institute of certified public accountants the sec and various bodies formed to promulgate and interpret appropriate accounting principles during fiscal 2010 the fasb issued exposure drafts of proposed accounting principles related to revenue recognition and leases which could change the way we account for certain of our transactions the fasb has continued to discuss these proposed accounting principles during fiscal 2011 a change in these or other principles or interpretations could have a significant effect on our reported financial results and could affect the reporting of transactions completed before the announcement of a change in addition the sec announced a multiyear plan that could ultimately lead to the use of international financial reporting standards by united states issuers in their sec filings any such change could have a significant effect on our reported financial results 

we have substantial cash requirements in the united states but a significant portion of our cash is held and generated outside of the united states and if our cash available in the united states is insufficient to meet our operating expenses and debt repayment obligations in the united states then we may be required to raise cash in ways that could negatively affect our financial condition results of operations and the market price of our common stock 

we have significant operations outside the united states as of december 31 2011 approximately 50 of our cash and cash equivalents balance was held by subsidiaries outside the united states with the remainder of the balance held by us or our subsidiaries in the united states we believe that the combination of our existing united states cash balances and future united states operating cash flows are sufficient to meet our ongoing united states operating expenses and debt repayment obligations however if these sources of cash were 

  

insufficient to meet our future funding obligations in the united states we could be required to seek other available funding sources which could negatively impact our results of operations financial position and the market price of our common stock 

our operating results could be adversely affected as a result of changes in our effective tax rates or by material differences between our forecasted annual effective tax rates and actual tax rates 

our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by the following 

 

         any significant change in our future effective tax rates could adversely impact our results of operations for future periods 

forecasts of our annual effective tax rate are complex and subject to uncertainty because our income tax position for each year combines the effects of estimating our annual income or loss the mix of profits and losses earned by us and our subsidiaries in tax jurisdictions with a broad range of income tax rates as well as benefits from available deferred tax assets the impact of various accounting rules and results of tax audits forecasts of our annual effective tax rate do not include the anticipation of future tax law changes if there were a material difference between forecasted and actual tax rates then it could have a material impact on our results of operations 

the irs and other tax authorities regularly examine our tax returns and the outcome of current and future tax examinations may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows 

the irs and other tax authorities regularly examine our income tax returns the calculation of our provision benefit for income taxes requires us to use significant judgment and involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in determining the adequacy of our provision benefit for income taxes we regularly assess the potential settlement outcomes resulting from income tax examinations however the final outcome of tax examinations including the total amount payable or the timing of any such payments upon resolution of these issues cannot be estimated with certainty in addition we cannot be certain that such amount will not be materially different from the amount that is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals should the irs or other tax authorities assess additional taxes as a result of a current or a future examination we may be required to record charges to operations in future periods that could have a material impact on our results of operations financial position or cash flows in the applicable period or periods 

we depend on a sole supplier for certain hardware components making us vulnerable to supply shortages and price fluctuation 

we are dependent on a sole supplier for certain hardware components our reliance on a sole supplier could result in product delivery problems and reduced control over product pricing and quality as well as limit our 

  

ability to identify and qualify another supplier in a timely manner while it is our goal to have multiple sources to procure certain key components in some cases it is not practical or feasible to do so we may suffer a disruption in the supply of certain hardware components if we are unable to purchase sufficient components on a timely basis or at all for any reason 

our operating results and revenue could be adversely affected by customer payment delays customer bankruptcies and defaults or modifications of licenses or supplier modifications 

on occasion we have customers file for bankruptcy or request to modify license terms but our past experience has been that these events did not have a material impact on our business or operating results if our customers experience adverse changes in their business in the future they may delay or default on their payment obligations to us file for bankruptcy or modify or cancel plans to license our products and our suppliers may significantly and quickly increase their prices or reduce their output if our customers are not successful in generating sufficient cash or are precluded from securing financing they may not be able to pay or may delay payment of accounts receivable that are owed to us although these obligations are generally not cancelable our customers’ inability to fulfill payment obligations may adversely affect our revenue and cash flow additionally our customers may seek to renegotiate preexisting contractual commitments payment defaults by our customers or significant reductions in existing contractual commitments could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results because of the relatively high levels of volatility that continue to drive significant fluctuations in asset prices as well as concern regarding high levels of leverage in sovereign and corporate debt the capital and credit markets are volatile and unpredictable if we were to seek funding from the capital or credit markets in response to any material level of customer defaults we may not be able to secure funding on terms acceptable to us or at all which may have a material negative effect on our business 

our restructuring plans may not result in the benefits we have anticipated possibly having a negative effect on our future operating results 

in recent fiscal years we have initiated restructuring plans in an effort to decrease costs by reducing our workforce and by consolidating facilities while those restructuring plans are almost complete we may not be able to realize the expected longterm benefits of our restructuring plans such as improvements in operating margins and cash flows our inability to realize these benefits may result in an inefficient business structure that could negatively affect our results of operations our restructuring plans may also subject us to litigation risks and expenses in addition our restructuring plans may have other consequences such as attrition beyond our planned reduction in workforce a negative effect on employee morale or our ability to attract highly skilled employees our competitors may also seek to gain a competitive advantage over us the restructuring plans could also cause our remaining employees to leave or result in reduced productivity by our employees and in turn this may affect our revenue and other operating results in the future 

failure to obtain export licenses could harm our business by rendering us unable to ship products and transfer our technology outside of the united states 

we must comply with regulations of the united states and of certain other countries in shipping our software products and transferring our technology outside the united states and to foreign nationals any significant future difficulty in complying could harm our business operating results or financial condition 

errors or defects in our products and services could expose us to liability and harm our reputation 

our customers use our products and services in designing and developing products that involve a high degree of technological complexity each of which has its own specifications because of the complexity of the systems and products with which we work some of our products and designs can be adequately tested only when put to full use in the marketplace as a result our customers or their end users may discover errors or defects in our software or the systems we design or the products or systems incorporating our design and intellectual property may not operate as expected errors or defects could result in 

 

    

     if we become subject to unfair hiring claims we could be prevented from hiring needed employees incur liability for damages and incur substantial costs in defending ourselves 

companies in our industry that lose employees to competitors frequently claim that these competitors have engaged in unfair hiring practices or that the employment of these persons would involve the disclosure or use of trade secrets these claims could prevent us from hiring employees or cause us to incur liability for damages we could also incur substantial costs in defending ourselves or our employees against these claims regardless of their merits defending ourselves from these claims could also divert the attention of our management away from our operations 

antitakeover defenses in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and certain provisions under delaware law could prevent an acquisition of our company or limit the price that investors might be willing to pay for our common stock 

our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and certain provisions of the delaware general corporation law that apply to us could make it difficult for another company to acquire control of our company for example 

 

  all or any one of these factors could limit the price that certain investors would be willing to pay for shares of our common stock and could allow our board of directors to resist delay or prevent an acquisition of our company even if a proposed transaction were favored by a majority of our independent stockholders 

our business is subject to the risk of earthquakes and other natural disasters 

our corporate headquarters including certain of our research and development operations and certain of our distribution facilities is located in the silicon valley area of northern california a region known to experience seismic activity if significant seismic activity were to occur our operations may be interrupted which could adversely impact our business and results of operations 

our other offices in the united states and in other countries around the world may be adversely impacted by natural disasters if a natural disaster occurs at or near any of our offices our operations may be interrupted which could adversely impact our business and results of operations if a natural disaster impacts a significant number of our customers our business and results of operations could be adversely impacted 

  

risks related to our securities and indebtedness 

our debt obligations expose us to risks that could adversely affect our business operating results or financial condition and could prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under such indebtedness 

we have a substantial level of debt as of december 31 2011 we had outstanding indebtedness with a principal balance of 4947 million as follows 

 

   the level of our current or future indebtedness among other things could 

 

       if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow or otherwise obtain funds necessary to make required payments or if we fail to comply with the various requirements of our indebtedness we would be in default which would permit the holders of our indebtedness to accelerate the maturity of the indebtedness and could cause defaults under any other indebtedness as well 

any default under our indebtedness could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition in addition a material default on our indebtedness could suspend our eligibility to register securities using certain registration statement forms under sec guidelines that permit incorporation by reference of substantial information regarding us potentially hindering our ability to raise capital through the issuance of our securities and increasing our costs of registration 

warrant transactions associated with our 2013 notes and 2015 notes will in certain circumstances dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders 

we entered into separate warrant transactions concurrent with the issuance of the 2013 notes for the purchase of up to approximately 236 million shares of cadence’s common stock at a strike price of 3150 per share we also entered into separate warrant transactions at the time of the issuance of the 2015 notes for the purchase of up to approximately 464 million shares of cadence’s common stock at a strike price of 1078 per share these warrants will be settled in net shares meaning that upon expiration of the warrants we will issue shares of our common stock to the purchasers of the warrants that represent the value by which the price of our common stock exceeds the strike price stipulated within the particular warrant agreement if cadence’s stock price is above the warrants’ strike price upon expiration of the warrants the warrants will dilute the ownership interest to our existing stockholders the warrants will also dilute our diluted earnings per share in periods when our average stock price exceeds the strike price of the particular warrant any sales in the public market of common stock issuable upon net settlement at expiration of the warrants could adversely affect then current market prices of our common stock 

  

conversion of our 2013 notes and 2015 notes prior to the scheduled maturities of the notes may adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition 

holders of our 2013 notes and 2015 notes may convert their notes into cash prior to the scheduled maturities if any of the conversion conditions for those notes are met the 2015 notes are convertible into cash only and the 2013 notes are convertible into a combination of cash and shares of our common stock 

in order for the 2015 notes to be convertible into cash in a particular fiscal quarter a conversion condition must be met during the preceding fiscal quarter during the three months ended december 31 2011 our closing stock price exceeded 981 for at least 20 days in the 30day period prior to december 31 2011 as a result the 2015 notes are convertible into cash from january 1 2012 through march 31 2012 and we have classified our 2015 notes as a current liability on our consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2011 the 2013 notes are not currently convertible 

so long as the 2015 notes are outstanding we will assess whether this conversion condition has been met at the end of each fiscal quarter if a conversion condition is met in any future fiscal quarter we would classify our 2015 notes as a current liability on our consolidated balance sheet as of the end of that fiscal quarter 

if one or more of the 2013 or 2015 note holders elect to convert their notes at a time when the conversion conditions have been met we would be required to settle the converted principal and in the case of the 2015 notes the conversion value through payment of cash which could adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition 

at the option of the holders of the 2013 notes and the 2015 notes under certain circumstances we may be required to repurchase the 2013 notes or the 2015 notes in cash 

under the terms of the 2013 notes and the 2015 notes we may be required to repurchase the 2013 notes and the 2015 notes following a “fundamental change” in our corporate ownership or structure such as a change of control in which substantially all of the consideration does not consist of publicly traded securities prior to maturity of the 2013 notes and the 2015 notes the repurchase price for the 2013 notes and the 2015 notes in the event of a fundamental change must be paid solely in cash this repayment obligation may have the effect of discouraging delaying or preventing a takeover of our company payment of our notes prior to their scheduled maturities could have a significant negative impact on our cash and liquidity and could impact our ability to invest financial resources in other strategic initiatives 

hedge and warrant transactions entered into in connection with the issuance of the 2013 notes and the 2015 notes may affect the value of our common stock 

we entered into hedge transactions with various financial institutions at the time of issuance of the 2013 notes and the 2015 notes with the objective of limiting the potential dilutive effect of issuing our common stock upon conversion of the 2013 notes and our exposure to the additional cash payments above the principal amount upon conversion of the 2015 notes we also entered into separate warrant transactions with the same financial institutions in connection with our hedge and warrant transactions associated with the 2013 notes and the 2015 notes these financial institutions purchased our common stock in secondary market transactions and entered into various overthecounter derivative transactions with respect to our common stock these entities or their affiliates are likely to modify their hedge positions from time to time prior to conversion or maturity of the 2013 notes and the 2015 notes by purchasing and selling shares of our common stock other of our securities or other instruments they may wish to use in connection with such hedging any of these transactions and activities could adversely affect the value of our common stock and as a result the number of shares and the value of the common stock that the 2013 note holders will receive upon conversion of the 2013 notes and the amount of cash that 2015 notes holders will receive upon conversion of the 2015 notes 

  

we are subject to the risk that the hedge participants fail to fulfill their obligations under the 2013 notes hedge transactions and the 2015 notes hedge transactions 

if any of the participants in the hedge transactions is unwilling or unable to perform its obligations for any reason we would not be able to receive the benefit of such transaction we cannot provide any assurances as to the financial stability or viability of any of the participants in the hedge transactions our 2015 notes became convertible into cash at the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2011 were not convertible as of the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2011 but were again convertible as of december 31 2011 the convertible note hedge transactions in connection with the 2015 notes or the 2015 notes hedges are intended to reduce our exposure above the 3500 million principal balance in the event of a cash conversion of the 2015 notes if the hedge participants fail to meet their obligations for any reasons it could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and financial condition 

rating agencies may provide unsolicited ratings on the 2013 notes and the 2015 notes that could reduce the market value or liquidity of our 2013 notes 2015 notes or our common stock 

we have not requested a rating of the 2013 notes or the 2015 notes from any rating agency and we do not anticipate that the 2013 notes or the 2015 notes will be rated however if one or more rating agencies independently elects to rate the 2013 notes or the 2015 notes and assigns the 2013 notes or the 2015 notes a rating lower than the rating expected by investors or reduces such rating in the future the market price or liquidity of the 2013 notes or the 2015 notes as the case may be and our common stock could be harmed should a decline occur in the market price of the 2013 notes or the 2015 notes as compared to the price of our common stock this may trigger the right of the holders of the 2013 notes or the 2015 notes to convert such notes into cash and shares of our common stock as applicable

none 




 item 2 properties 

we own land and buildings at our headquarters located in san jose california we also own buildings in india as of december 31 2011 the total square footage of our owned buildings was approximately 965000 

we lease additional facilities in the united states and various other countries we sublease certain of these facilities where space is not fully utilized or has been impacted as part of our restructuring plans 

we believe that these facilities are adequate for our current needs and that suitable additional or substitute space will be available as needed to accommodate any expansion of our operations 




 item 3 legal proceedings 

from time to time we are involved in various disputes and litigation that arise in the ordinary course of business these include disputes and lawsuits related to intellectual property indemnification obligations mergers and acquisitions licensing contracts distribution arrangements and employee relations matters at least quarterly we review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure if the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount or the range of loss can be estimated we accrue a liability for the estimated loss legal proceedings are subject to uncertainties and the outcomes are difficult to predict because of such uncertainties accruals are based on our judgments using the best information available at the time as additional information becomes available we reassess the potential liability related to pending claims and litigation matters and may revise our estimates 

in february 2011 we agreed to settle our pending derivative and securities litigation for an additional description of our legal proceedings and these settlements see note 16 in our notes to consolidated financial statements

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k and with item 1a “risk factors” please refer to the cautionary language at the beginning of part i of this annual report on form 10k regarding forwardlooking statements 

business overview 

we develop eda software hardware and ip we license software and ip sell or lease hardware technology provide maintenance for our offerings and provide engineering and education services to help manage and accelerate product development processes for semiconductor and electronics systems companies our customers use our products and services to design and develop complex ics and electronics systems 

substantially all of our revenue is generated from ic and electronics systems manufacturers and designers and is dependent upon their commencement of new design projects as a result our revenue is significantly influenced by our customers’ business outlook and investment in the introduction of new products and the improvement of existing products 

we have identified certain items that management uses as performance indicators to manage our business including revenue certain elements of operating expenses and cash flow from operations and we describe these items further below under the heading “results of operations” and “liquidity and capital resources” 

critical accounting estimates 

in preparing our consolidated financial statements we make assumptions judgments and estimates that can have a significant impact on our revenue operating income loss and net income loss as well as on the value of certain assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets we base our assumptions judgments and estimates on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions at least quarterly we evaluate our assumptions judgments and estimates and make changes as deemed necessary we believe that the assumptions judgments and estimates involved in the accounting for revenue recognition income taxes allowance for doubtful accounts business combinations intangible asset and goodwill impairments and fair value of financial instruments have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements therefore we consider these to be our critical accounting estimates for information on our significant accounting policies see note 2 in our notes to consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition 

we begin to recognize revenue from licensing and supporting our software vip and design ip and hardware products when all of the following criteria are met 

 

    significant judgment is involved in the determination of whether the facts and circumstances of an arrangement support that the fee for the arrangement is considered to be fixed or determinable and that collectibility of the fee is probable and these judgments can affect the amount of revenue that we recognize in a particular reporting period we must also make these judgments when assessing whether a contract amendment to a term arrangement primarily in the context of a license extension or renewal constitutes a concession our experience has been that we are able to determine whether a fee is fixed or determinable for term licenses and we have established a history of collecting under contracts for which the fee has been assessed as fixed or determinable without providing concessions on payments products or services 

  

for installment contracts that do not include a substantial upfront payment we consider that a fee is fixed or determinable only if the arrangement has payment periods that are equal to or less than the term of the licenses and the payments are collected in equal or nearly equal installments when evaluated over the entire term of the arrangement while we do not expect our experience to change if we no longer were to have a history of collecting under the original contract without providing concessions on term licenses revenue from term licenses would be required to be recognized when payments under the installment contract become due and payable such a change could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

we are generally able to estimate whether collection is probable but significant judgment is applied as we assess the creditworthiness of our customers to make this determination if our experience were to change it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations if in our judgment collection of a fee is not probable we do not record revenue until the uncertainty is removed which is generally upon receipt of cash payment 

for subscription licenses of our software products and term and perpetual licenses that do not include a stated annual maintenance renewal rate we generally recognize revenue ratably over the term of the license agreement beginning with delivery of the products and such revenue is allocated between product and maintenance revenue for term and perpetual licenses of our software products that include a stated annual maintenance renewal rate we generally recognize revenue for software license fees upfront when all four of the revenue recognition criteria outlined above are met generally commencing upon delivery in either case maintenance fees are recognized ratably over the maintenance term a relatively small percentage of our revenue from software licenses is recognized on an upfront basis 

sale of our hardware products generally involves the following deliverables the hardware product and its related essential software and maintenance for the hardware and the software consideration allocated to the hardware product and the essential software is recognized as revenue at the time of delivery provided all other conditions for revenue recognition have been met consideration allocated to the maintenance is recognized ratably over the maintenance term 

revenue from services contracts is recognized either on the time and materials method as work is performed or on the percentageofcompletion method for contracts with fixed or nottoexceed fees we estimate on a monthly basis the percentage of completion based on the completion of milestones relating to the arrangement we have a history of accurately estimating project status and the costs necessary to complete projects a number of internal and external factors can affect our estimates including labor rates utilization and efficiency variances and specification and testing requirement changes if different conditions were to prevail such that accurate estimates could not be made then the use of the completed contract method would be required and the recognition of all revenue and costs would be deferred until the project was completed such a change could have a material impact on our results of operations 

if a group of contracts is so closely related that they are in effect part of a single arrangement such arrangements are deemed to be a multiple element arrangement or mea we exercise significant judgment to evaluate the relevant facts and circumstances in determining whether the separate contracts should be accounted for individually as distinct arrangements or whether the separate contracts are in substance an mea our judgments about whether a group of contracts is an mea can affect the timing of revenue recognition under those contracts which could have an effect on our results of operations for the periods involved for example when term license agreements that would otherwise result in upfront revenue upon delivery may be deemed part of an mea when they are executed within close proximity or in contemplation of other license agreements that require ratable revenue recognition with the same customer in which event all the revenue is recognized over the longest term of any component of the mea instead of upfront 

  

for a single transaction or mea that includes software and nonsoftware elements we allocate consideration to all deliverables based on their relative standalone selling prices revenue allocated to each deliverable is then recognized when all four criteria are met in these circumstances there is a hierarchy to determine the standalone selling price to be used for allocating consideration to the deliverables as follows 

 

   we calculate the esp of our hardware products based on our pricing practices including the historical average prices charged for comparable hardware products because vsoe or tpe cannot be established our process for determining esp for our software deliverables without vsoe or tpe takes into account multiple factors that vary depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each deliverable key external and internal factors considered in developing the esps include prices charged by us for similar arrangements historical pricing practices and the nature of the product in addition when developing esps we may consider other factors as appropriate including the pricing of competitive alternatives if they exist and productspecific business objectives we exercise significant judgment to evaluate the relevant facts and circumstances in calculating the esp of the deliverables in our arrangements 

accounting for income taxes 

we provide for the effect of income taxes in our consolidated financial statements using the asset and liability method we also apply a twostep approach to determining the financial statement recognition and measurement of uncertain tax positions 

we must make significant assumptions judgments and estimates to determine our current provision benefit for income taxes our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance to be recorded against our deferred tax assets our judgments assumptions and estimates relating to the current provision benefit for income taxes include the geographic mix and amount of income loss our interpretation of current tax laws and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax authorities our judgments also include anticipating the tax positions we will take on tax returns before actually preparing and filing the tax returns changes in our business tax laws or our interpretation of tax laws and developments in current and future tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our results of operations financial position or cash flows 

deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to tax benefit carryforwards and to differences between the financial statement amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis we regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance if there is a greater than 50 likelihood that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized to make this judgment we must make predictions of the amount and category of taxable income from various sources and weigh all available positive and negative evidence about these possible sources of taxable income we give greater weight to evidence that can be objectively verified for example we determined that our cumulative loss incurred in the united states for the three year period ended december 31 2011 was significant negative evidence with a high level objectivity that outweighed our ability to rely on projections of future income for the years ended december 31 2011 and january 1 2011 we concluded that a significant valuation allowance was required based on our evaluation and weighting of the positive and negative evidence if in the future we determine that these deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized a release of all or part of the related valuation allowance could result in a material income tax benefit in the period such determination is made for an additional description of the valuation allowance see note 6 in our notes to consolidated financial statements 

we only recognize the tax benefit of an income tax position if we judge that there is a greater than 50 likelihood that the tax position will be sustained solely on its technical merits in a tax audit including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes to make this judgment we must interpret complex and sometimes ambiguous tax laws regulations and administrative practices if we judge that an income tax position meets this recognition threshold then we must measure the amount of the tax benefit to be recognized by estimating the 

  

largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon effective settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all of the relevant facts it is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts as this requires us to determine the probability of various possible settlement outcomes to determine when a tax position is effectively settled we must estimate the likelihood that a taxing authority would rereview a tax position after a tax examination has otherwise been completed we must also determine when it is reasonably possible that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits will significantly increase or decrease in the 12 months after each fiscal yearend these judgments are difficult because a taxing authority may change its behavior as a result of our disclosures in our financial statements or for other reasons in addition we are required by the irs to disclose uncertain tax positions taken on our federal tax returns we must reevaluate our income tax positions on a quarterly basis to consider factors such as changes in facts or circumstances changes in tax law effectively settled issues under audit and new audit activity such a change in recognition or measurement would result in recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

we make judgments as to our ability to collect outstanding receivables and provide allowances for a portion of receivables when collection becomes doubtful this allowance is based on our assessment of the creditworthiness of our customers historical experience and the overall economic climate of the industries that we serve while we believe that our allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate we continue to monitor customer liquidity and other economic conditions which may result in changes to our estimates regarding our ability to collect from our customers changes in circumstances such as an unexpected change in a customer’s ability to meet its financial obligation to us or a customer’s payment trends or a downward trend in the volume of business in the semiconductor sector are hard to predict and may require us to adjust our estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to us these changes could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

business combinations 

when we acquire businesses we allocate the purchase price to acquired tangible assets and liabilities including deferred revenue liabilities associated with the fair value of contingent consideration and acquired identifiable intangible assets any residual purchase price is recorded as goodwill the allocation of the purchase price requires us to make significant estimates in determining the fair values of these acquired assets and assumed liabilities especially with respect to intangible assets and goodwill these estimates are based on information obtained from management of the acquired companies our assessment of this information and historical experience these estimates can include but are not limited to the cash flows that an acquired business is expected to generate in the future the cash flows that specific assets acquired with that business are expected to generate in the future the appropriate weightedaverage cost of capital and the cost savings expected to be derived from acquiring an asset these estimates are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and if different estimates were used the purchase price for the acquisition could be allocated to the acquired assets and liabilities differently from the allocation that we have made to the acquired assets and liabilities in addition unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that may affect the accuracy or validity of such estimates and if such events occur we may be required to adjust the value allocated to acquired assets or assumed liabilities 

we also make significant judgments and estimates when we assign useful lives to the definite lived intangible assets identified as part of our acquisitions these estimates are inherently uncertain and if we used different estimates the useful life over which we amortize intangible assets would be different in addition unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that may impact the useful life over which we amortize our intangible assets which would impact our amortization of intangible assets expense and our results of operations 

intangible asset and goodwill impairments 

we assess the impairment of longlived assets including certain intangibles whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that we will not be able to recover an asset group’s carrying amount 

  

recoverability of an asset group is measured by comparing its carrying amount to the expected future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of that asset group excluding future interest costs that would be recognized as an expense when incurred any impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds its fair market value significant management judgment is required in 

 

   we test goodwill for impairment annually or whenever events and changes in circumstances suggest that the carrying amount may not be recoverable the test is performed at the reporting unit level by comparing the reporting unit’s carrying amount including goodwill to the fair value of the reporting unit the fair value of the reporting unit is estimated and if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value goodwill is considered to be impaired and a second step is performed to measure the amount of the impairment loss 

we completed our annual goodwill impairment test during the third quarter of fiscal 2011 and determined that the fair value of our single reporting unit substantially exceeded the carrying amount of our net assets and that no impairment existed 

fair value of financial instruments 

inputs to valuation techniques are observable or unobservable observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources while unobservable inputs reflect our market assumptions these two types of inputs have created the following fairvalue hierarchy 

 

   this hierarchy requires us to minimize the use of unobservable inputs and to use observable market data if available when determining fair value we recognize transfers between levels of this hierarchy based on the fair values of the respective financial instruments at the end of the reporting period in which the transfer occurred 

the types of instruments that trade in markets that are not considered to be active but are valued based on quoted market prices broker or dealer quotations or alternative pricing sources with reasonable levels of price transparency are generally classified within level 2 of the fair value hierarchy 

certain instruments are classified within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy because they trade infrequently and therefore have little or no price transparency for those instruments that are not traded in active markets or are subject to transfer restrictions valuations are adjusted to reflect illiquidity andor nontransferability and such adjustments are generally based on available market evidence in the absence of such evidence our best estimate is used 

while we believe the observable inputs we use to measure the assets and liabilities included in level 2 and the unobservable inputs we use to measure the assets and liabilities included in level 3 are reasonable different inputs or estimates may materially impact the resulting fair value measurements of these instruments and may also impact our results of operations for an additional description of our fair value measurements see note 9 in our notes to consolidated financial statements 

  

results of operations 

overview of fiscal 2011 

financial results for fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009 reflect the following 

 

            revenue 

we primarily generate revenue from licensing our eda software and ip selling or leasing our hardware technology providing maintenance for our software ip and hardware and providing engineering services we principally use three license types subscription term and perpetual the different license types provide a customer with different conditions of use for our products such as 

 

   the timing of our product revenue is significantly affected by the mix of bookings executed in any given period and whether the revenue for such bookings is recognized over multiple periods or upfront upon completion of delivery 

we seek to achieve a mix of bookings with approximately 90 of the aggregate value of our bookings of a type for which the revenue is recurring or ratable in nature and approximately 10 of the resulting revenue recognized upfront upon completion of delivery our ability to achieve this 90 to 10 ratio of ratable to upfront bookings may be impacted by an increase in hardware sales beyond our current expectations because revenue for hardware sales is generally recognized upfront in the quarter in which it is installed and ready for use for an additional description of the impact of hardware sales on the anticipated mix of bookings see the discussion under the heading “critical accounting estimates — revenue recognition” above and note 2 in our notes to consolidated financial statements 

  

approximately 90 of the aggregate value of our bookings during fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010 was of a type for which the revenue is recurring or ratable in nature approximately 90 of our fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010 revenue came from ratable bookings 

customer decisions regarding these aspects of license transactions determine the license type timing of revenue recognition and potential future business activity for example if a customer chooses a fixed duration of use this will result in either a subscription or term license a business implication of this decision is that at the expiration of the license period the customer must decide whether to continue using the technology and therefore renew the license agreement historically larger customers generally have used products from two or more of our five product groups and rarely completely terminated their relationship with us upon expiration of the license for an additional description of license types and timing of revenue recognition see the discussion under the heading “critical accounting estimates — revenue recognition” above 

although we believe that pricing volatility has not generally been a material component of the change in our revenue from period to period we believe that the amount of revenue recognized in future periods will depend on among other things the 

 

      the value and renewal of contracts and consequently product revenue recognized are affected by the competitiveness of our products product revenue recognized in any period is also affected by the extent to which customers purchase subscription term or perpetual licenses and by the extent to which contracts contain flexible payment terms 

revenue mix 

we analyze our software vip and design ip and hardware businesses by product group combining revenues for both product and maintenance because of their interrelationship we have formulated a design solution strategy that combines our design technologies into categories as described in the various product groups below 

digital ic design  products in this group including the encounter digital ic design platform are used to create and convert the highlevel logical representation of a digital ic into a detailed physical blueprint and ultimately produce the detailed design information describing how the ic will be manufactured the final product of the design flow is a file that describes the various photomasks which are used to manufacture the ic 

functional verification and design ip  products in this group including the incisive functional verification platform are used to verify that the highlevel logical representation of an ic design is functionally correct and for verification at the system and soc levels our emulation hardware products vip products memory subsystem models and design ip products are also included in this product group 

custom ic design  our custom design products including the virtuoso custom design platform are used to create ics that must be designed at the transistor level including analog rf memory highperformance digital blocks and standard cell libraries included in this group are specialized verification products that simulate the operation of the design prior to manufacturing the final product of the design flow is a file that describes the various photomasks which are used to manufacture the ic 

design for manufacturing  included in the dfm product group are our physical verification manufacturing optimization and layout analysis products these products are used to analyze optimize and verify that the physical blueprint of the ic has been constructed correctly and can be manufactured successfully while our primary focus in dfm is to address manufacturing effects in the upstream digital and custom design flows those products included in this dfm category also are offered separately from our other tools 

  

system interconnect design  this product group consists of our pcb and ic package design products including the allegro and orcad ® products the allegro system interconnect design platform enables consistent codesign of interconnects across ics ic packages and pcbs while the orcad line focuses on costeffective entrylevel pcb solutions 

for an additional description of our current product strategy see the discussion under the heading “products and product strategy” under item 1 “business” 

revenue by year 

the following table shows our revenue for fiscal 2011 fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009 with the dollar and percentage change in revenue between years 

 

 product revenue increased during fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 primarily because of increased business levels an increase in revenue related to the sale and lease of our hardware products increased revenue recognized from bookings in prior periods a decrease in the average contract duration and an increase in revenue from the business of denali which we acquired in the second quarter of fiscal 2010 we expect to recognize increased product revenue during fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 due to higher business levels increased revenue from our backlog and our continued transition to a more ratable license mix 

product revenue increased during fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 primarily because of higher business levels due to the timing of contract renewals with existing customers and from contracts executed in prior quarters due to our continued transition to a ratable license mix 

services revenue increased during fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 primarily because of cash collections from customers on orders fulfilled in years prior to 2011 for which revenue was recognized in fiscal 2011 upon receipt of cash payment and because of higher utilization rates for our services personnel we expect a decrease in services revenue during fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 as certain of our design services engineers have been redeployed to internal research and development projects and to assist with presales activities 

maintenance revenue increased during fiscal 2011 as compared to 2010 and during 2010 as compared to 2009 primarily because of higher business levels due to the timing of contract renewals with existing customers 

we adopted new revenue recognition accounting standards on the first day of fiscal 2011 for revenue arrangements that include both hardware and software elements if we had accounted for all meas entered into on or after january 2 2011 under the software revenue recognition standards regardless of whether they included hardware revenue for fiscal 2011 would have been lower by 154 million for an additional description of our adoption of these accounting standards see note 2 in our notes to consolidated financial statements 

  

the following table shows the percentage of product and related maintenance revenue contributed by each of our five product groups and services and other during fiscal 2011 fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009 

 

 the changes in the percentage of revenue contributed by the functional verification and design ip product group for the fiscal years presented are generally related to increased hardware revenue and from our acquisition of denali in june 2010 

as described in note 2 in our notes to consolidated financial statements certain of our licensing arrangements allow customers the ability to remix among software products additionally we have arrangements with customers that include a combination of our products with the actual product selection and number of licensed users to be determined at a later date for these arrangements we estimate the allocation of the revenue to product groups based upon the expected usage of our products the actual usage of our products by these customers may differ and if that proves to be the case the revenue allocation in the table above would differ 

although we believe the methodology of allocating revenue to product groups is reasonable there can be no assurance that such allocated amounts reflect the amounts that would result had the customer individually licensed each specific software solution at the onset of the arrangement 

revenue by geography 

 

 the increase in revenue across our geographies is primarily because of increased business levels an increase in revenue related to the sale and lease of our hardware products increased revenue recognized from bookings in prior periods a decrease in the average contract duration and an increase in revenue from the business of denali which we acquired in the second quarter of fiscal 2010 

  

revenue by geography as a percentage of total revenue 

 

 no single customer accounted for 10 or more of total revenue during fiscal 2011 fiscal 2010 or fiscal 2009 

most of our revenue is transacted in the united states dollar however certain revenue transactions are denominated in foreign currencies primarily the japanese yen and we recognize additional revenue from those contracts in periods when the united states dollar weakens in value against the japanese yen and reduced revenue from those contracts in periods when the united states dollar strengthens against the japanese yen for an additional description of how changes in foreign exchange rates affect our consolidated financial statements see the discussion under the heading “item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk — foreign currency risk” 

stockbased compensation expense summary 

stockbased compensation expense is recorded within the various components of our costs and expenses 

 

stockbased compensation expense did not change significantly during fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 and decreased by 112 million during fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 primarily due to the following 

 

  we expect stockbased compensation to increase during fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 due to higher grant date fair values of restricted stock option awards and purchase rights granted under the espp based on the assumption that our stock price will be higher during fiscal 2012 than in the prior years 

  

cost of revenue 

 

 the following table shows cost of revenue as a percentage of related revenue for fiscal 2011 fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009 

 

 cost of product 

cost of product includes costs associated with the sale and lease of our hardware and licensing of our software and design ip products cost of product associated with our hardware products includes materials assembly and overhead these additional hardware manufacturing costs make our cost of hardware product higher as a percentage of revenue than our cost of software and design ip products cost of product also includes the cost of employee salary benefits and other employeerelated costs including stockbased compensation expense amortization of acquired intangibles directly related to our products as well as the costs of technical documentation and royalties payable to thirdparty vendors 

a summary of cost of product during the last three fiscal years is as follows 

 

 the changes in cost of product were due to the following 

 

 hardware costs increased by 310 million during fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 primarily due to an increase in hardware business amortization of acquired intangibles included in cost of product increased during fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 primarily due to an increase in amortization of intangible assets associated with the denali acquisition for a full fiscal year as well as amortization from other acquisitions completed in 2011 

  

cost of product depends primarily upon the actual mix of hardware and software product sales in any given period and upon the extent to which we acquire intangible assets acquire or license thirdparties’ intellectual property or technology and sell our products that include acquired or licensed intellectual property or technology 

cost of services 

cost of services primarily includes employee salary benefits and other employeerelated costs costs to maintain the infrastructure necessary to manage a services organization and provisions for contract losses if any the changes in cost of services were due to the following 

 

 we expect cost of services to decrease during fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 as certain of our design services engineers have been redeployed to internal research and development projects and to assist with presales activities 

cost of maintenance 

cost of maintenance includes the cost of our customer support services such as telephone online and onsite support employee salary benefits and other employeerelated costs and documentation of maintenance updates as well as amortization of intangible assets directly related to our maintenance contracts the changes in cost of maintenance were due to the following 

 

 amortization of acquired intangibles decreased by 10 million during fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 and decreased by 31 million during fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 because certain acquired intangible assets became fully amortized during fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2011 

operating expenses 

our operating expenses include costs presented as marketing and sales research and development and general and administrative changes in our overall operating expenses in any given period are primarily attributable to changes in employee salary and other compensationrelated costs factors that may cause our headcount costs to fluctuate may include changes in the number of employees due to hiring acquisitions restructuring activities foreign exchange rates cost reduction strategies and the impact of our various incentive 

  

compensation programs which are driven by overall business performance our employee salary and other compensationrelated costs increased during fiscal 2011 when compared to fiscal 2010 primarily due to improved business levels in 2011 resulting in higher sales commissions and other incentive compensation our operating expenses for 2010 and 2011 also included the incremental costs associated with our acquisition of denali in june 2010 

we expect operating expenses to increase during fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 primarily due to projected increases in salary benefits incentive compensation and other employeerelated costs expected to be incurred in connection with the anticipated continued improvement in our business and investment in our research and development activities 

our operating expenses for fiscal 2011 fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009 were as follows 

 

 marketing and sales 

 

 the changes in marketing and sales expense were due to the following 

 

 research and development 

 

   

the changes in research and development expense were due to the following 

 

 we recorded employeerelated costs in research and development expense of 15 million during fiscal 2011 and 102 million during fiscal 2010 related to deferred denali acquisition payments and we expect to expense the remaining 09 million over the stated retention periods through 2014 for an additional description of the deferred denali acquisition payments see note 4 in our notes to consolidated financial statements 

general and administrative 

 

 the changes in general and administrative expense were due to the following 

 

 we recorded net recoveries of our allowance for doubtful accounts of 66 million during fiscal 2011 and 165 million during fiscal 2010 because we collected certain receivables that previously had been included in our allowance for doubtful accounts we had previously recorded reserves for certain customers based on changes in our assessment of collectability for those customers the principal factor for the assessment at that time was a general deterioration of economic conditions having a significant impact on certain customers as a result we recorded 216 million of reserves during fiscal 2009 for certain customer balances estimated to be uncollectible at that time these customers’ business prospects eventually improved and we were able to collect the majority of those receivables that had previously been reserved resulting in recoveries of previously reserved 

  

bad debts in excess of increases in bad debt reserves for both fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010 for an additional description of our allowance for doubtful accounts see note 8 in our notes to consolidated financial statements 

amortization of acquired intangibles 

 

 the changes in amortization of acquired intangibles were due to the following 

 

 restructuring and other charges credits 

we initiated multiple restructuring plans in previous years including a 2009 restructuring plan and a 2010 restructuring plan for an additional description of these restructuring plans see note 7 in our notes to consolidated financial statements 

because the restructuring charges and related benefits are derived from management’s estimates made during the formulation of the restructuring plans based on thencurrently available information our restructuring plans may not achieve the benefits anticipated on the timetable or at the level contemplated demand for our products and services and ultimately our future financial performance is difficult to predict with any degree of certainty accordingly additional actions including further restructuring of our operations may be required in the future 

the following table presents restructuring and other charges credits for our restructuring plans 

 

 restructuring and other charges recorded during fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009 consisted primarily of costs for severance and termination benefits related to our restructuring plans 

litigation charges 

in february 2011 we agreed to settle our pending derivative and securities litigation subject to completion of final settlement documentation by the parties and court approval accordingly we recorded litigation charges of 158 million during fiscal 2010 total settlement costs were 400 million less 242 million paid by our insurance carriers for an additional description of our legal proceedings and this settlement see note 16 in our notes to consolidated financial statements 

  

interest expense 

 

 on december 15 2011 we paid the remaining balance of our 2011 notes in full as a result we expect interest expense to decrease during fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 as we will not incur any interest expense or amortization of deferred financing costs for the 2011 notes during fiscal 2012 

the increase in interest expense during fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 was due to interest expense related to the 2015 notes that were issued in june 2010 for an additional description of our 2015 notes and 2013 notes see note 3 in our notes to consolidated financial statements 

other income expense net 

other income expense net for fiscal 2011 fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009 was as follows 

 

 certain of our nonmarketable securities became marketable during fiscal 2011 and we sold them and recognized a gain of 80 million 

certain of nonmarketable securities were otherthantemporarily impaired and we wrote down these nonmarketable securities by 15 million during fiscal 2010 and 52 million during fiscal 2009 

  

provision benefit for income taxes 

the provision benefit for income taxes and the effective tax rates during fiscal 2011 fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009 were as follows 

 

 our fiscal 2011 provision for income taxes is primarily related to 114 million of tax expense on certain of our foreign subsidiaries 54 million of excess tax benefits from employee stock compensation that were allocated to stockholder’s equity and 41 million of interest expense on unrecognized tax benefits that was partially offset by 50 million of tax benefit from the release of valuation allowance due to the recognition of deferred tax liabilities resulting from a fiscal 2011 business combination 

our fiscal 2010 benefit for income taxes is primarily related to the decrease in net unrecognized tax benefits and accrued interest of 1479 million as a result of our effective settlement of certain tax matters with the irs in august 2010 and the release of 667 million of valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets primarily due to the recognition of deferred tax liabilities related to the acquisition of intangibles with denali in june 2010 our fiscal 2010 benefit for income taxes included 46 million of tax expense for uncertain tax positions that should have been recognized during fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2009 the effects of this tax expense on our consolidated financial statements for fiscal 2010 and prior fiscal years are not considered material 

during fiscal 2009 a change in united states federal tax law allowed companies to elect to carry back the fiscal 2009 net operating loss for a period of three four or five years instead of the general twoyear carryback period our benefit for income taxes during fiscal 2009 is primarily due to 273 million of tax benefit from the fiscal 2009 united states federal net operating losses that can be utilized to offset taxable income in prior years that is partially offset by current year interest expense related to unrecognized tax benefits of 133 million and an increase in unrecognized tax benefits penalties and interest related to prior year tax positions of 145 million with the exception of the fiscal 2009 united states federal net operating loss that can be utilized in prior years we recorded a valuation allowance that offset the tax benefit from other fiscal 2009 united states losses and tax credits the 145 million increase in unrecognized tax benefits penalties and interest during fiscal 2009 included 73 million of unrecognized tax benefits penalties and interest that should have been recognized during multiple periods between fiscal 2004 through fiscal 2008 the effects on our consolidated financial statements for fiscal 2009 and prior periods are not considered material 

we intend to indefinitely reinvest approximately 1738 million of undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries as of december 31 2011 to meet the working capital and longterm capital needs of our foreign subsidiaries the unrecognized deferred tax liability for these indefinitely reinvested foreign earnings was approximately 835 million as of december 31 2011 

we regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance if it is more than 50 likely that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized we concluded that a valuation allowance of 3759 million was required as of december 31 2011 this represents an increase in valuation allowance of 12 million in comparison with the year ended january 1 2011 if in the future we determine that these deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized a release of all or part of the related valuation allowance could result in a material income tax benefit in the period such determination is made 

for an additional description of our income taxes including the calculation of our valuation allowance our deferred tax assets and the status of the irs examinations see note 6 in our notes to consolidated financial statements 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

 

  

  

 

 cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments 

as of december 31 2011 our principal sources of liquidity consisted of 6046 million of cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments as compared to 5701 million as of january 1 2011 and 5713 million as of january 2 2010 

our primary sources of cash during fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010 were 

 

     our primary uses of cash during fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010 were 

 

        approximately 50 of our cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments were held by our foreign subsidiaries as of december 31 2011 our intent is to permanently reinvest our earnings from certain foreign operations we do not anticipate we will need to repatriate dividends from foreign operations that are permanently reinvested in order to fund our domestic operations in the event that dividends from foreign operations that are currently permanently reinvested are needed to fund united states liquidity we could be required to accrue and pay additional taxes in order to repatriate these funds 

  

we expect that current cash cash equivalents and shortterm investment balances and cash flows that are generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital other capital and liquidity requirements for at least the next 12 months 

net working capital 

the changes in net working capital were due to the following 

 

 the decrease in our net working capital as of december 31 2011 as compared to january 1 2011 is primarily due to the classification of our 2015 notes as a current liability as of december 31 2011 

as of december 31 2011 the 2015 notes are convertible into cash from january 1 2012 through march 31 2012 because cadence’s stock price exceeded 981 for at least 20 days in the 30 day period prior to december 31 2011 accordingly we classified the net balance of the 2015 notes of 2941 million as a current liability on our consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2011 the classification of the 2015 notes as current or longterm on the consolidated balance sheet is evaluated at each balance sheet date and may change from time to time depending on whether the stock price conversion condition as described above has been met in a particular quarter if the note holders elect to convert their 2015 notes prior to maturity any unamortized discount and transaction fees will be expensed at the time of conversion if the entire outstanding principal amount had been converted on december 31 2011 we would have recorded an expense of 636 million associated with the conversion comprised of 559 million of unamortized debt discount and 77 million of unamortized transaction fees 

the classification of the liability associated with the cash conversion feature of the 2015 notes or the 2015 notes embedded conversion derivative and the 2015 notes hedges asset as current or longterm on our consolidated balance sheet corresponds with the classification of the 2015 notes as such we classified the fair value of the 2015 notes embedded conversion derivative as a current liability on our consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2011 which increased our total current liabilities by 2151 million we also classified the fair value of the 2015 notes hedges as current assets on our consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2011 which increased total current assets by 2151 million the value of the 2015 notes embedded conversion derivative liability and the value of the 2015 notes hedges asset were offsetting and resulted in no net change to our net working capital as of december 31 2011 

if the holders of our 2015 notes elect to convert their notes into cash we would be required to make cash payments of up to 3500 million prior to the maturity of the 2015 notes in connection with the 2015 notes we entered into the 2015 notes hedges and sold warrants to limit our exposure to the additional cash payments above the 3500 million principal balance in the event of a cash conversion of the 2015 notes the 2015 notes currently trade at a premium to their ifconverted value so we do not anticipate a conversion of the 2015 notes 

  

by the note holders between january 1 2012 and march 31 2012 however if the holders of the 2015 notes elect to convert their notes between january 1 2012 and march 31 2012 we expect to have sufficient cash to fund any payment resulting from this conversion 

for an additional description of our 2015 notes see “other factors affecting liquidity and capital resources” and note 3 in our notes to consolidated financial statements 

cash flows from operating activities 

the changes in net cash provided by operating activities were due to the following 

 

 cash flows from operating activities include net income adjusted for certain noncash charges as well as changes in the balances of certain assets and liabilities our cash flows from operating activities are significantly influenced by business levels and the payment terms set forth in our license agreements 

if our customers experience adverse changes in the future are not successful in generating sufficient cash or are precluded from securing financing they may delay purchasing our products and services or they may not be able to pay or may delay payment of accounts receivable that are owed to us although these obligations are generally not cancelable our customers’ inability to fulfill payment obligations may adversely affect our cash flow additionally our customers may seek to renegotiate preexisting contractual commitments though we have not yet experienced a material level of defaults any material payment default by our customers or significant reductions in existing contractual commitments would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and cash flows from operations for an additional description of our accounts receivable and our allowances for doubtful accounts see note 8 in our notes to consolidated financial statements 

in february 2011 all parties to our securities and derivative litigation agreed to settle the litigation for total consideration of 400 million of which 242 million was to be paid by our insurance carriers during fiscal 2011 we paid 164 million into a securities litigation settlement fund which amount included our portion of the settlement consideration plus accrued interest as of december 31 2011 we have paid and our insurance carriers have paid all amounts specified by the settlement agreement into the securities litigation settlement fund the settlements are subject to court approval 

we expect to pay an additional 50 million related to our previous restructuring activities primarily for payments related to vacated facilities net of expected sublease income 

during fiscal 2011 we determined that uncertain tax positions that were subject to the irs examination of our federal corporation income tax returns for the tax years 2003 through 2009 were effectively settled we do not expect the effective settlement to result in significant cash payments 

we expect that cash flows from operating activities will fluctuate in future periods due to a number of factors including our operating results and the timing of our billings collections and tax payments 

  

cash flows from investing activities 

the changes in net cash from investing activities were due to the following 

 

 the changes in net cash used in investing activities during fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 and during fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 is primarily due to cash paid for our acquisition of denali during fiscal 2010 for an aggregate initial purchase price of 2968 million for an additional description of our acquisition of denali see note 4 in our notes to consolidated financial statements 

in connection with our business combinations and asset acquisitions completed before december 31 2011 we may be obligated to make payments based on or subject to the satisfaction of certain performance metrics if performance is such that these payments are fully achieved we would be obligated to pay up to an aggregate of 307 million in cash during the next 52 months 

we expect to continue our investing activities including purchasing property plant and equipment purchasing intangible assets purchasing software licenses business combinations and making longterm equity investments 

cash flows from financing activities 

during fiscal 2011 we paid the 1500 million remaining principal balance on the 2011 notes in full 

during fiscal 2010 we issued 3500 million principal amount of the 2015 notes concurrently with the issuance of the 2015 notes we entered into the 2015 notes hedges to limit our exposure to the additional cash payments above the principal amount of the 2015 notes that may be due to the holders in separate transactions we also sold warrants or the 2015 warrants to purchase our common stock at a strike price of 1078 per share we used an aggregate of 1872 million of the net proceeds from the issuance of the 2015 notes to purchase in the open market 1000 million principal amount of our 2011 notes and 1000 million principal amount of our 2013 notes and we repurchased approximately 65 million shares of our common stock at a cost of 400 million 

in a separate transaction during fiscal 2010 we repurchased in the open market 55 million principal amount of our 2013 notes 

  

the changes in net cash from financing activities were due to the following 

 

 for an additional description of our 2013 notes and 2015 notes and the conversion terms thereof see note 3 in our notes to consolidated financial statements and “net working capital” above 

during fiscal 2010 we paid 97 million of taxes related to employee stock transactions see note 6 in our notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of this payment 

the increase in proceeds from the issuance of common stock during fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 resulted from an increase in employee participation in our espp an increase in the exercise of stock options and an increase in our stock price the decrease in proceeds from the issuance of common stock during fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 is primarily due to decreased purchase limits under our espp which became effective during fiscal 2009 

we recorded losses on the reissuance of treasury stock of 166 million during fiscal 2011 874 million during fiscal 2010 and 2134 million during fiscal 2009 

as of december 31 2011 we have 8144 million remaining under the stock repurchase programs authorized by our board of directors see note 13 in our notes to consolidated financial statements 

other factors affecting liquidity and capital resources 

as of december 31 2011 we have convertible notes outstanding with a net liability value of approximately 4260 million which mature between december 15 2013 and june 1 2015 the principal maturity value of these convertible notes is approximately 4947 million the total cash or stock payable upon the early conversion of these notes as determined by the indenture of each security will be their principal amount plus any additional conversion value that would be contractually due upon conversion 

in the case of our 2015 notes we will owe additional cash to the note holders upon early conversion if our stock price exceeds 755 per share we entered into hedges with counterparties to limit our exposure to the additional cash payments above the principal amount of the 2015 notes that may be due to the holders upon conversion in separate transactions we sold warrants with a strike price of 1078 per share although our incremental cash payout exposure above the conversion price is limited by the hedges to the 3500 million outstanding principal value of the 2015 notes we will experience dilution to our stock and to our diluted earnings per share from the outstanding warrants to the extent our stock price exceeds 1078 additionally holders may convert their 2015 notes into cash during the quarters our stock price closes above 981 for at least 20 days in the 30 day period preceding the end of each fiscal quarter while holders of the 2015 notes would have the right to convert their notes if early conversion conditions are met we do not expect holders of the 2015 notes to convert their notes under such circumstances because the economic value to the holders of the notes has exceeded and likely would exceed the cash received upon conversion if holders of the 2015 notes were to choose to convert at a time in which the notes are convertible it could have a significant negative impact on our cash and liquidity 

  

in the case of our 2013 notes we may owe shares of our common stock to the note holders upon conversion if our stock price exceeds 2115 per share we entered into hedges with counterparties to limit our exposure to the dilution that may result from the issuance of shares upon conversion of the 2013 notes in separate transactions we sold warrants with a strike price of 3150 per share we will experience dilution to our stock and to diluted earnings per share from the outstanding warrants to the extent our stock price exceeds 3150 

we expect to fund the maturity of the 2013 notes in december 2013 with our cash on hand and future cash flows from operations the 2013 notes could become convertible prior to their maturity if certain conversion conditions are met however we do not currently expect any of the conversion conditions to be met prior to the maturity of the 2013 notes we believe that we will have sufficient cash in future periods to service the maturities of our 2015 notes but future changes in our cash position cash flows from operating activities cash flows from investing activities cash flows from financing activities as well as general business levels and changes in our access to financing may impact our future ability to settle the principal amount payable to the holders of the 2013 notes and 2015 notes when they mature or convert 

for an additional description of the 2015 notes and 2013 notes the conversion terms thereof and the hedge and warrants transactions see note 3 in our notes to consolidated financial statements and “net working capital” above 

income taxes 

we provide for united states income taxes on earnings of our foreign subsidiaries unless the earnings are considered indefinitely invested outside the united states as of december 31 2011 we had a deferred tax liability of 56 million related to 54 million of earnings from certain foreign subsidiaries that are not considered indefinitely reinvested outside the united states and for which we have previously accrued income tax expense 

we intend to indefinitely reinvest approximately 1738 million of undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries as of december 31 2011 to meet the working capital and longterm capital needs of our foreign subsidiaries the unrecognized deferred tax liability for these indefinitely reinvested foreign earnings was approximately 835 million as of december 31 2011 

during fiscal 2011 we determined that uncertain tax positions that were subject to the irs examinations of our federal income tax returns for the tax years 2003 through 2009 were effectively settled during fiscal 2011 we made additional cash payments of approximately 41 million to the irs and to various state and local tax authorities to cover the significant portion of our remaining tax liabilities related to these settlements 

as of december 31 2011 we had longterm income tax liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits of 712 million for an additional description of the income tax liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits see the discussion under the heading “contractual obligations” 

  

contractual obligations 

a summary of our contractual obligations as of december 31 2011 is as follows 

 

  

 

  

  

  

   

in connection with our acquisitions completed before december 31 2011 we would be obligated to pay up to an aggregate of 307 million in cash during the next 52 months if certain defined performance goals are achieved in full 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

as of december 31 2011 we did not have any significant offbalance sheet arrangements as defined in item 303a4ii of sec regulation sk 

new accounting standards 

in june of 2011 the financial accounting standards board issued new accounting standards regarding the presentation of comprehensive income loss in the financial statements the new standard requires presentation of the components of net income loss the components of other comprehensive income loss and total comprehensive income loss either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income loss or in two separate but consecutive statements the new standard eliminates the option to present the components of other comprehensive income loss as part of the statement of stockholders’ equity and comprehensive income loss the new guidance will be effective on a retrospective basis in the first quarter of fiscal 2012 we are currently assessing the impact of adoption of the guidance on our consolidated financial statements 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

foreign currency risk 

a material portion of our revenue expenses and business activity are transacted in the united states dollar however certain of our operations include transactions in foreign currencies that can affect our results of operations in certain countries where we invoice customers in the local currency japan in particular our revenues are benefited from a weaker dollar and are adversely affected by a stronger dollar the opposite impact occurs in countries where we record expenses in local currencies in those cases our operating expenses are benefited from a stronger dollar and are adversely affected by a weaker dollar most of our revenue is transacted in us dollars the fluctuations in our operating expenses outside the united states resulting from volatility in the us dollar against certain foreign currencies are not generally moderated by corresponding fluctuations in our revenues 

we enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts with financial institutions to protect against currency exchange risks associated with existing assets and liabilities a foreign currency forward exchange contract acts as a hedge by increasing in value when underlying assets decrease in value or underlying liabilities increase in value due to changes in foreign exchange rates conversely a foreign currency forward exchange contract decreases in value when underlying assets increase in value or underlying liabilities decrease in value due to changes in foreign exchange rates these forward contracts are not designated as accounting hedges and therefore the unrealized gains and losses are recognized in other income expense net in advance of the actual foreign currency cash flows with the fair value of these forward contracts being recorded as accrued liabilities or other current assets 

our policy governing hedges of foreign currency risk does not allow us to use forward contracts for trading purposes our forward contracts generally have maturities of 90 days or less the effectiveness of our hedging program depends on our ability to estimate future asset and liability exposures we enter into currency forward exchange contracts based on estimated future asset and liability exposures recognized gains and losses with respect to our current hedging activities will ultimately depend on how accurately we are able to match the amount of currency forward exchange contracts with actual underlying asset and liability exposures 

  

the following table provides information as of december 31 2011 about our forward foreign currency contracts the information is provided in united states dollar equivalent amounts the table presents the notional amounts at contract exchange rates and the weightedaverage contractual foreign currency exchange rates expressed as units of the foreign currency per united states dollar which in some cases may not be the market convention for quoting a particular currency all of these forward contracts mature before or during february 2012 

 

 while we actively monitor our foreign currency risks there can be no assurance that our foreign currency hedging activities will substantially offset the impact of fluctuations in currency exchange rates on our results of operations cash flows and financial position 

interest rate risk 

our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our portfolio of cash and cash equivalents while we are exposed to interest rate fluctuations in many of the world’s leading industrialized countries our interest income and expense is most sensitive to fluctuations in the general level of united states interest rates in this regard changes in united states interest rates affect the interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents and the costs associated with foreign currency hedges 

we invest in high quality credit issuers and by policy limit the amount of our credit exposure to any one issuer other than the united states of america or the us as part of our policy our first priority is to reduce the risk of principal loss consequently we seek to preserve our invested funds by limiting default risk market risk reinvestment risk and sovereign debt risk of issuers other than the us we mitigate default risk by investing in only high quality credit securities that we believe to have low credit risk and by positioning our portfolio to respond appropriately to a significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor including any sovereign debt issuer other than the us the shortterm interestbearing portfolio of cash and cash equivalents includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity 

  

all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase are considered to be cash equivalents investments with maturities greater than three months are classified as availableforsale and are considered to be shortterm investments the carrying value of our interestbearing instruments approximated fair value as of december 31 2011 the following table presents the carrying value and related weightedaverage interest rates for our interestbearing instruments which are all classified as cash and cash equivalents on our consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2011 

 

 equity price risk 

convertible notes 

our 2015 notes and 2013 notes include conversion and settlement provisions that are based on the price of our common stock at conversion or at maturity of the notes in addition the hedges and warrants associated with these convertible notes also include settlement provisions that are based on the price of our common stock the amount of cash we may be required to pay or the number of shares we may be required to provide to note holders at conversion or maturity of these notes is determined by the price of our common stock the amount of cash or number of shares that we may receive from hedge counterparties in connection with the related hedges and the number of shares that we may be required to provide warrant counterparties in connection with the related warrants are also determined by the price of our common stock 

for an additional description of our 2015 notes and 2013 notes see note 3 in our notes to consolidated financial statements and “liquidity and capital resources — other factors affecting liquidity and capital resources” under item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” 

investments 

we have a portfolio of equity investments that includes marketable equity securities and nonmarketable equity securities our equity investments are made primarily in connection with our strategic investment program under this program from time to time we make cash investments in companies with technologies that are aligned with our strategic objectives for an additional description of these investments see note 10 in our notes to consolidated financial statements our investments in nonmarketable equity securities had a carrying value of 105 million as of december 31 2011 and 93 million as of january 1 2011 

  




 item 9 changes in and disagreements with accountants on accounting and financial disclosure 

none 




 item 9a controls and procedures 

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

we carried out an evaluation required by rule 13a15 of the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended or the exchange act under the supervision and with the participation of our management including our chief executive officer or ceo and our chief financial officer or cfo of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rules 13a15e and 15d15e under the exchange act as of december 31 2011 

the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures included a review of our processes and the effect on the information generated for use in this annual report on form 10k in the course of this evaluation we 

  

sought to identify any material weaknesses in our disclosure controls and procedures to determine whether we had identified any acts of fraud involving personnel who have a significant role in our disclosure controls and procedures and to confirm that any necessary corrective action including process improvements was taken this type of evaluation is done every fiscal quarter so that our conclusions concerning the effectiveness of these controls can be reported in our periodic reports filed with the sec the overall goals of these evaluation activities are to monitor our disclosure controls and procedures and to make modifications as necessary we intend to maintain these disclosure controls and procedures modifying them as circumstances warrant 

based on their evaluation as of december 31 2011 our ceo and cfo have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by us in our reports filed or submitted under the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the sec’s rules and forms and is accumulated and communicated to our management including the ceo and cfo as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure 

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended december 31 2011 that materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting 

inherent limitations on effectiveness of controls 

our management including our ceo and cfo does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all error and all fraud internal control over financial reporting no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of internal control are met further the design of internal control must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of the control must be considered relative to their costs while our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance of their effectiveness because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within cadence have been detected 

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rule 13a15f under the exchange act our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2011 in making this assessment our management used the criteria established in internal control – integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission our management has concluded that as of december 31 2011 our internal control over financial reporting is effective based on these criteria our independent registered public accounting firm kpmg llp has issued an attestation report on our internal control over financial reporting which is included in item 15 “exhibits and financial statement schedules”

overview 

 

we develop electronic design automation or eda software hardware and silicon intellectual property or ip we license software and ip sell or lease hardware technology and provide engineering and education services throughout the world to help manage and accelerate electronics product development processes our customers use our products and services to design and develop complex integrated circuits or ics and electronics systems 

 

we were organized as a delaware corporation in june 1988 our headquarters is located at 2655 seely avenue san jose california 95134 our telephone number is 408 9431234 we use our website at wwwcadencecom as a channel for distribution of important information about our company including news releases and financial information our website permits investors to subscribe to email notification alerts when we post new material information on our website we also make available on our investor relations webpage free of charge copies of our sec filings and submissions including our proxy statement as soon as reasonably practicable after electronically filing or furnishing such documents with the sec our corporate governance guidelines code of business conduct and the charters of the audit committee compensation committee and corporate governance and nominating committee of our board of directors are also posted on the investor relations webpage on our website stockholders may also request copies of these documents by writing to our corporate secretary at the address above information on our website is not incorporated by reference in this annual report on form 10k unless expressly noted 

 

factors driving the electronic design automation industry 

 

in 2009 the semiconductor industry’s sales declined as the global macroeconomic environment was negatively affected by decreased consumer spending high unemployment and restrained corporate spending during this period electronics companies faced increased financial pressures in addition to the traditional challenges of cost quality innovation and timetomarket associated with development of highly complex electronics systems and integrated circuit or ic products in 2010 the semiconductor industry grew significantly as consumer demand for electronic products improved as global economic conditions improved while the eda industry benefited from this improved environment eda customers remained cautious about making substantial new eda expenditures the 

semiconductor industry is forecasted to grow modestly in 2011 and we believe that spending on eda offerings may also grow modestly as customers invest in new projects 

 

electronics companies demand ever higher levels of productivity from their design teams better predictability in their development schedules and higher quality products in order to be competitive and profitable in the priceconscious markets they serve electronics companies are responding to demand for increased functionality and miniaturization by combining subsystems — such as radio frequency or rf wireless communication video signal processing and microprocessors — onto a single silicon chip creating a systemonchip or soc or multiple chips into a single chip package in a format referred to as systeminpackage or sip these trends toward subsystem integration have required chip makers to find solutions to challenges previously addressed by system companies such as verifying systemlevel functionality and hardwaresoftware interoperability 

 

our offerings address many of the challenges associated with developing unique silicon circuitry integrating original circuitry with ip developed by third parties to create socs and combining ics and socs with software to create electronic systems our strategy is to provide our customers with the ability to address the broad range of issues that arise at the silicon soc and system levels in 2010 we published our vision for the industry called eda360 which describes in detail the challenges and opportunities in eda the acquisition of denali software inc or denali supports multiple aspects of our strategy to address customer challenges the most significant issues that our customers face in creating their products include optimizing energy consumption manufacturing microscopic circuitry verifying device functionality and achieving technical performance targets all while meeting aggressive cost requirements 

 

these issues are becoming more complex as requirements for performance size cost and features evolve across the full spectrum of electronics products such as smart phones tablets televisions communications and internet infrastructure and computing platforms providers of eda solutions must deliver products that address these technical challenges while improving the productivity predictability reliability and profitability of the design processes and products of their customers 

 

products and product strategy 

 

our products are engineered to improve our customers’ design productivity and design quality by providing a comprehensive set of eda tools and a differentiated portfolio of ip product revenues include all fees earned from granting licenses to use our software and ip and from sales and leases of our hardware products and exclude revenues derived from maintenance and services see “product licensing arrangements” for a discussion of our license types 

 

we combine our products and technologies into “platforms” for four major design activities 

 

  

the four cadence ® design platforms are branded as incisive ® functional verification encounter ® digital ic design virtuoso ® custom design and allegro ® system interconnect design in addition we augment these platform product offerings with a set of design for manufacturing or dfm products that service both the digital and custom ic design flows 

 

the products and technologies that comprise our platforms are combined with services readytouse packages of technologies assembled from our broad portfolio and other associated components that provide comprehensive solutions for low power mixed signal enterprise verification and advanced node designs these solutions and their constituent elements are marketed to users who specialize in areas such as system design and verification functional verification logic design digital implementation custom ic design and printed circuit board or pcb and ic package  sip design 

 

our product revenue was 4716 million or 50 of our total revenue during fiscal 2010 4008 million or 47 of our total revenue during fiscal 2009 and 5166 million or 50 of our total revenue during fiscal 2008 for 

an additional description of our product revenue see the discussion under the heading “results of operations” under item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” 

 

functional verification 

 

functional verification products are used by our customers to efficiently and effectively verify that the circuitry they have designed will perform as intended this is accomplished in advance of actually manufacturing the circuitry which reduces the risk of discovering an error in the completed product our offerings are comprised of two major categories logic verification and system design and verification 

 

our logic verification offering consists of planning property checking testbench simulation verification ip and environment capabilities within the incisive functional verification platform this offering enables our customers to employ methodologydriven enterpriselevel verification process automation including metricdriven verification planning process tracking and management that allow the coordination of verification activities across multiple teams and various specialists for rapid verification planning and closure 

 

our system design and verification offerings consist of hardwareassisted verification with emulation and acceleration including the verification computing platform palladium ® xp palladium ® and xtreme ® platforms systemlevel design capabilities verification ip estimation of soc cost and performance consulting services and methodologies that provide customers with automation for hardwaresoftware verification and effective system design in addition this offering provides system power exploration analysis and optimization the quickcycles ® program allows customers access to our simulation acceleration and emulation products either on their secure internet site or remotely over a highspeed secure network connection 

 

the products obtained through the acquisition of denali including verification ip memory models and design ip are included in this category of our offerings 

 

digital ic design and implementation 

 

digital ic offerings are used by our customers to create logical representations of a digital circuit or ic that can be verified for correctness prior to manufacturing once verified the logical representation is implemented or converted to a format ready for silicon manufacturing using additional software tools within this category our digital ic offerings include two major categories logic design and physical implementation 

 

our logic design offering is comprised of formal verification equivalency checking synthesis and test capabilities within the encounter digital ic design platform and property checking simulation and environment capabilities within the incisive functional verification platform this offering provides chip planning design verification and test technologies and services to customers across all digital design end markets logic design capabilities are aggregated into solutions that address our customers’ needs in areas such as power efficiency and advanced process nodes

design for manufacturing 

 

with the advent of silicon manufacturing technologies at geometries of 65 nanometer and below our customers are increasingly concerned about the manufacturability and yield of their designs the physical layout of each ic requires detailed analysis and optimization to ensure that the design can be manufactured in volume while performing as expected our strategy is to integrate dfm awareness into our core design platforms of encounter digital ic and virtuoso custom ic some of our dfm capabilities include electrical and physical lithography checking chemicalmechanical polishing analysis and optimization pattern matching and optical proximity checking 

 

our primary focus in dfm is to address manufacturing effects as early in the product development process as possible as a result we are enhancing the dfm awareness of our core encounter digital ic and virtuoso custom ic product offerings in addition to upstream integration of dfm technologies we also offer standalone dfm products 

 

third party programs and initiatives 

 

in addition to our products many customers use internallydeveloped design tools or design tools provided by other eda companies as well as ip available from multiple suppliers we support the use of thirdparty design products and ip through vehicles such as our connections ® program and through our participation in the openaccess coalition the power forward initiative and other programs and initiatives we also contribute to the development and deployment of eda industry standards 

 

maintenance 

 

customer service and support is critical to the adoption and successful use of our products we provide our customers with technical support to facilitate their use of our software ip and hardware solutions 

 

we offer maintenance to our customers as an integral noncancelable component of our subscription and most term license agreements as a component of certain other term license agreements subject to annual renewal or as a separate agreement subject to annual renewal for our perpetual license customers 

 

our maintenance revenue was 3635 million or 39 of our total revenue during fiscal 2010 3453 million or 40 of our total revenue during fiscal 2009 and 3885 million or 37 of our total revenue during fiscal 2008 for an additional description of our maintenance revenue see the discussion under the heading “results of operations” under item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” 

 

services 

 

we offer a number of feebased services including engineering and education services these services may be sold separately or sold and performed in conjunction with the sale lease or license of our products

marketing and sales 

 

we generally market our products and provide maintenance and services to existing and prospective customers through a direct sales force consisting of sales people and applications engineers applications engineers provide technical presales and postsales support for software products due to the complexity of many of our eda products and the electronic design process the sales cycle is generally long requiring three to six months or more during the sales cycle our direct sales force generally provides technical presentations product demonstrations and support for onsite customer evaluation of our solutions we also promote our products and services through advertising direct mail trade shows public relations and the internet we selectively utilize value added resellers to broaden our reach and reduce cost of sales all orcad and selected incisive products are primarily marketed through these channels with respect to international sales we generally market and support our products and services through our subsidiaries we also use a thirdparty distributor to sell our products and services to certain customers in japan 

 

product licensing arrangements 

 

we sell software using three license types subscription term and perpetual customers who prefer to license technology for a specified limited period of time will choose either a subscription or term license and customers who prefer to have the right to use the technology continuously without time restriction will choose a perpetual license customers who desire to use new technology during the life of the contract will select a subscription license which allows them limited access to unspecified new technology on a whenandifavailable basis as 

opposed to a term or perpetual license which does not include rights to use new technology payment terms for subscription and term licenses generally provide for payments to be made in installments over the license period and payment terms for perpetual licenses generally are net 30 days 

 

we offer a delivery mechanism for term and subscription licenses called eda cards eda cards have an overall value amount that customers draw down against as they select specific products that are priced based on the particular duration of use the customer desires the selection and licensing of the specific products is accomplished through an automated online system the card expires when its total value is consumed by the customer or on the predetermined expiration date whichever comes first there are two types of eda cards an eda gold card is a term license that enables a customer to access a predetermined list of existing products an eda platinum card is a subscription license that enables a customer limited access to existing and new technology 

 

we generally license our ip under nonexclusive license agreements that provide usage rights for specific applications fees under these licenses are typically charged on a per design basis we also sell and lease our hardware products 

 

for a further description of our license agreements revenue recognition policies and results of operations please refer to the discussion under the heading “critical accounting estimates” under item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” 

 

backlog 

 

our backlog as of january 1 2011 was approximately 17 billion as compared to approximately 16 billion as of january 2 2010 and consists of revenue to be recognized in fiscal periods after january 1 2011 for fully executed arrangements with effective dates no later than april 2 2011 which is the last day of our first quarter of fiscal 2011 and from a variety of license types which generally include but are not limited to 

 

  

the substantial majority of our backlog is generated by our product and maintenance businesses because customer licenses generally include both product and maintenance components historically we have not experienced significant cancellations of our contracts with customers however we occasionally reschedule the required completion dates of engineering services contracts deferring revenue recognition under those contracts beyond the original anticipated completion date changes in customer license types or payment terms also can affect the timing of revenue recognition during fiscal 2010 approximately 75 of our revenue came from orders in backlog as of january 2 2010 we expect approximately 80 of our fiscal 2011 revenue to come from our backlog as of january 1 2011 

 

revenue seasonality 

 

in the third quarter of fiscal 2008 we began transitioning to a license mix that includes a higher proportion of arrangements requiring ratable revenue recognition prior to this transition revenue was generally lowest in our first quarter and highest in our fourth quarter with a material decline between the fourth quarter of one year and the first quarter of the following year however the transition to a more ratable license mix means that revenue may no longer follow our historical quarterly pattern 

 

research and development 

 

our investment in research and development was 3764 million during fiscal 2010 3547 million during fiscal 2009 and 4579 million during fiscal 2008 

the primary areas of our research and development include soc design the design of silicon devices highperformance ic packaging sip and pcb design systemlevel modeling and verification highperformance logic verification technology ip and hardwaresoftware coverification the electronics industry combines rapid innovation with rapidly increasing design and manufacturing complexity so we make significant investments in enhancing our current products as well as creating new products and technologies and integrating those products and technologies together into segmented solutions 

 

our future performance depends largely on our ability to maintain and enhance our current product development and commercialization to develop acquire or operate with new products from third parties and to develop solutions that meet increasingly demanding productivity quality predictability and cost requirements on a schedule that keeps pace with our customers’ technical developments and industry standards 

 

manufacturing and software distribution 

 

we perform final assembly and testing of our verification acceleration and emulation hardware products at our headquarters in san jose california subcontractors manufacture all major subassemblies including all individual pcbs and custom ics and supply them for qualification and testing before their incorporation into the assembled product 

 

software and documentation are primarily distributed to customers by secure electronic delivery or on dvd 

 

proprietary technology 

 

our success depends in part upon our proprietary technology we generally rely on patents copyrights trademarks and trade secret laws licenses and restrictive agreements to establish and protect our proprietary rights in technology and products many of our products include software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties we may have to seek new licenses or renew existing licenses for third party software and other intellectual property in the future as part of performing engineering services for customers our engineering services business uses certain software and other intellectual property licensed from third parties including that of our competitors 

 

competition 

 

we compete in eda software products and maintenance primarily with three companies synopsys inc mentor graphics corporation and magma design automation inc we also compete with numerous smaller eda companies with manufacturers of electronic devices that have developed or have the capability to develop their own eda products and with numerous electronics design and consulting companies in the area of ip we compete with synopsys inc and numerous smaller ip companies we generally compete on the basis of quality product features level of integration or compatibility with other tools price payment terms and maintenance offerings 

 

it is our strategy to use engineering services as a differentiator to further promote our products and maintenance businesses certain competitive factors in the engineering services business as described herein differ from those of the products and maintenance businesses while we do compete with other eda companies in the engineering services business our principal competitors include independent engineering service businesses these companies vary greatly in focus geographic location capability cost structure and pricing we compete with these companies by focusing on the design of complex analog digital and mixedsignal ics and socs 

 

international operations 

 

we have 48 sales offices design centers and research and development facilities approximately twothirds of which are located outside of the united states we consider customer sales and support requirements the availability of a skilled workforce and costs and efficiencies among other relative benefits when determining what operations to locate internationally for an additional description of our international operations see the discussion under the heading “the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations and other risks to our international operations may seriously harm our financial condition” under item 1a “risk factors” and note 21 to our consolidated financial statements 

employees 

 

as of january 1 2011 we employed approximately 4600 individuals including approximately 95 employees whose positions were eliminated in restructuring activities announced in the first quarter of fiscal 2011

 item 1a risk factors tableend  

our business faces many risks described below are what we believe to be the material risks that we face if any of the events or circumstances described in the following risks actually occurs our business financial condition or results of operations could suffer 

 

risks related to our business 

 

we are subject to the cyclical nature of the integrated circuit and electronics systems industries and any downturn in these industries may reduce our orders and revenue 

 

purchases of our products and services are dependent upon the commencement of new design projects by ic manufacturers and electronics systems companies the ic and electronics systems industries are cyclical and are characterized by constant and rapid technological change rapid product obsolescence and price erosion evolving standards short product life cycles and wide fluctuations in product supply and demand 

 

the ic and electronics systems industries experienced significant challenges in 2008 and 2009 the ic and electronic systems industries have also experienced significant downturns in connection with or in anticipation of maturing product cycles of both these industries’ and their customers’ products the economic downturn in 2008 and 2009 was characterized by diminished product demand production overcapacity high inventory levels and significant decreases in average selling prices this economic downturn in the industries we serve contributed to the reduction in our revenue in 2008 and 2009 as compared to our revenue in 2007 although the semiconductor industry experienced growth in 2010 and is expected to grow modestly in 2011 we believe that spending on eda products and services may grow more slowly than the semiconductor industry as a whole in 2011 

 

we have experienced varied operating results and our operating results for any particular fiscal period are affected by the timing of significant orders for our software products fluctuations in customer preferences for license types and the timing of revenue recognition under those license types 

 

we have experienced and may continue to experience varied operating results in particular we incurred net losses during fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2009 we recorded net income in 2010 and we may incur a net loss in the future various factors affect our operating results and some of them are not within our control our operating results for any period are affected by the timing of certain orders for our software products 

 

our operating results are also affected by the mix of license types executed in any given period we license software using three different license types subscription term and perpetual product revenue associated with term and perpetual licenses that include a stated annual maintenance renewal rate is recognized upon the later of the effective date of the arrangement or delivery of the software product product revenue associated with term licenses that do not include a stated annual maintenance renewal rate and product revenue associated with subscription licenses is recognized over multiple periods during the term of the license revenue may also be deferred until payments become due and payable from customers with nonlinear payment terms or as cash is collected from customers with lower credit ratings in addition revenue is affected by the timing of license renewals changes in existing contractual arrangements with customers and the mix of license types ie perpetual term or subscription for existing customers these changes could have the effect of accelerating or delaying the recognition of revenue from the timing of recognition under the original contract our license mix has changed such that a substantial proportion of licenses require ratable revenue recognition and we expect the license mix combined with the modest growth in spending by our customers in the semiconductor sector may make it difficult for us to significantly increase our revenue in future fiscal periods 

 

we plan operating expense levels primarily based on forecasted revenue levels these expenses and the effect of longterm commitments are relatively fixed in the short term in addition revenue levels are harder to forecast in a difficult economic environment if the macroeconomic environment weakens and we experience a shortfall in revenue our operating results could differ from our expectations because we may not be able to quickly reduce our expenses in response to shortterm business changes 

the methods estimates and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies have a significant impact on our results of operations see “critical accounting estimates” under item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” such methods estimates and judgments are by their nature subject to substantial risks uncertainties and assumptions and factors may arise over time that may lead us to change our methods estimates and judgments changes in those methods estimates and judgments could significantly affect our results of operations 

 

you should not view our historical results of operations as reliable indicators of our future performance if our revenue operating results or business outlook for future periods fall short of the levels expected by securities analysts or investors the trading price of our common stock could decline 

 

our failure to respond quickly to technological developments could make our products uncompetitive and obsolete 

 

the industries in which we compete experience rapid technology developments changes in industry standards and customer requirements and frequent new product introductions and improvements currently the industries we serve are experiencing the following trends 

 

  

if we are unable to respond quickly and successfully to these trends we may lose our competitive position and our products or technologies may become uncompetitive or obsolete to compete successfully we must develop or acquire new products and improve our existing products and processes on a schedule that keeps pace with technological developments and the requirements for products addressing a broad spectrum of designers and designer expertise in our industries we must also be able to support a range of changing computer software hardware platforms and customer preferences we cannot guarantee that we will be successful in this effort 

our stock price has been subject to significant fluctuations and may continue to be subject to fluctuations 

 

the market price of our common stock has experienced significant fluctuations and may fluctuate or decline in the future and as a result you could lose the value of your investment the market price of our common stock may be affected by a number of factors including but not limited to 

 

  

in addition equity markets in general and the equities of technology companies in particular have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations such price and volume fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock for reasons unrelated to our business or operating results 

 

litigation could adversely affect our financial condition or operations 

 

we are currently and in the future may be involved in various disputes and litigation that arise in the ordinary course of business these include disputes and lawsuits related to intellectual property mergers and acquisitions licensing contracts distribution arrangements and employee relations matters we are also currently engaged in a consolidated securities class action lawsuit and shareholder derivative lawsuits for information regarding the litigation matters in which we are currently engaged please refer to the discussion under item 3 “legal proceedings” and note 15 to our consolidated financial statements we cannot provide any assurances that the final outcome of these lawsuits or any other proceedings that may arise in the future will not have a material adverse effect on our business operating results financial condition or cash flows litigation can be timeconsuming and expensive and could divert management’s time and attention from our business which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and operating results 

 

our future revenue is dependent in part upon our installed customer base continuing to license or buy additional products renew maintenance agreements and purchase additional services 

 

our installed customer base has traditionally generated additional new license service and maintenance revenues in future periods customers may not necessarily license or buy additional products or contract for additional services or maintenance in some cases maintenance is renewable annually at a customer’s option and there are no mandatory payment obligations or obligations to license additional software if our customers decide not to renew their maintenance agreements or license additional products or contract for additional services or if they reduce the scope of the maintenance agreements our revenue could decrease which could have an adverse effect on our operating results our customers many of which are large semiconductor companies often have significant bargaining power in negotiations with us mergers or acquisitions of our customers can reduce the total level of purchases of our software and services and in some cases increase customers’ bargaining power in negotiations with their suppliers including us 

 

we depend upon our management team and key employees and our failure to attract train motivate and retain management and key employees may make us less competitive in our industries and therefore harm our results of operations 

 

our business depends upon the efforts and abilities of our executive officers and other key employees including key development personnel from time to time there may be changes in our management team resulting from the hiring and departure of executive officers and as a result we may experience disruption to our business 

that may harm our operating results and our relationships with our employees customers and suppliers may be adversely affected competition for highly skilled executive officers and employees can be intense particularly in geographic areas recognized as high technology centers such as the silicon valley area where our principal offices are located and the other locations where we maintain facilities to attract retain and motivate individuals with the requisite expertise we may be required to grant large numbers of stock options or other stockbased incentive awards which may be dilutive to existing stockholders and increase compensation expense and pay significant base salaries and cash bonuses which could harm our operating results the high cost of training new employees not fully utilizing these employees or losing trained employees to competing employers could also reduce our operating margins and harm our business or operating results 

 

in addition the nasdaq marketplace rules require stockholder approval for new equity compensation plans and significant amendments to existing equity compensation plans including increases in shares available for issuance under such plans and prohibit nasdaq member organizations from giving a proxy to vote on equity compensation plans unless the beneficial owner of the shares has given voting instructions these regulations could make it more difficult for us to grant equity compensation to employees in the future to the extent that these regulations make it more difficult or expensive to grant equity compensation to employees we may incur increased compensation costs or find it difficult to attract retain and motivate employees which could materially and adversely affect our business 

 

we may not receive significant revenue from our current research and development efforts for several years if at all 

 

developing eda technology and integrating acquired technology into existing platforms is expensive and these investments often require a long time to generate returns our strategy involves significant investments in research and development and related product opportunities we believe that we must continue to dedicate a significant amount of resources to our research and development efforts to maintain and improve our competitive position however we cannot ensure that we will receive significant if any revenue from these investments 

 

the competition in our industries is substantial and we may not be able to continue to successfully compete in our industries 

 

the eda industry and the commercial electronics engineering services industry are highly competitive if we fail to compete successfully in these industries it could seriously harm our business operating results or financial condition to compete in these industries we must identify and develop or acquire innovative and costcompetitive eda products integrate them into platforms and market them in a timely manner we must also gain industry acceptance for our engineering services and offer better strategic concepts technical solutions prices and response time or a combination of these factors than those of our competitors and the internal design departments of electronics manufacturers we may not be able to compete successfully in these industries factors that could affect our ability to succeed include 

 

 13 

 

we compete in the eda products market with synopsys inc magma design automation inc and mentor graphics corporation we also compete with numerous smaller eda companies with manufacturers of electronic devices that have developed or have the capability to develop their own eda products and with numerous electronics design and consulting companies 

 

we may need to change our pricing models to compete successfully 

 

the highly competitive markets in which we compete can put pressure on us to reduce the prices of our products if our competitors offer deep discounts on certain products in an effort to recapture or gain market segment share or to sell other software or hardware products we may then need to lower our prices or offer other favorable terms to compete successfully any such changes would be likely to reduce our profit margins and could adversely affect our operating results any substantial changes to our prices and pricing policies could cause sales and software license revenues to decline or be delayed as our sales force implements and our customers adjust to the new pricing policies some of our competitors may bundle products for promotional purposes or as a longterm pricing strategy or provide guarantees of prices and product implementations these practices could over time significantly constrain the prices that we can charge for our products if we cannot offset price reductions with a corresponding increase in the number of sales or with lower spending then the reduced license revenues resulting from lower prices could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

 

we have acquired and expect to acquire other companies and businesses and may not realize the expected benefits of these acquisitions 

 

we have acquired and expect to acquire other companies and businesses in the future while we expect to carefully analyze each potential acquisition before committing to the transaction we may not consummate any particular transaction but may nonetheless incur significant costs or if a transaction is consummated we may not be able to integrate and manage acquired products and businesses effectively in addition acquisitions involve a number of risks if any of the following events occurs when we acquire another business it could seriously harm our business operating results or financial condition 

 

  

in a number of our previously completed acquisitions we have agreed to make future payments either in the form of employee bonuses or contingent purchase price payments based on the performance of the acquired businesses or the employees who joined us with the acquired businesses we may continue to use contingent purchase price payments in connection with acquisitions in the future the performance goals pursuant to which these future payments may be made generally relate to achievement by the acquired business or the employees who joined us with the acquired business of certain specified orders revenue run rate product proliferation product development or employee retention goals during a specified period following completion of the applicable acquisition future acquisitions may involve issuances of stock as full or partial payment of the purchase price for the acquired business grants of incentive stock or options to employees of the acquired businesses which may be dilutive to existing stockholders expenditure of substantial cash resources or the incurrence of material amounts of debt 

the specific performance goal levels and amounts and timing of employee bonuses or contingent purchase price payments vary with each acquisition while we expect to derive value from an acquisition in excess of such contingent payment obligations our strategy may change and we may be required to make certain contingent payments without deriving the anticipated value 

 

we rely on our proprietary technology as well as software and other intellectual property rights licensed to us by third parties and we cannot assure you that the precautions taken to protect our rights will be adequate or that we will continue to be able to adequately secure such intellectual property rights from third parties 

 

our success depends in part upon our proprietary technology we generally rely on patents copyrights trademarks trade secret laws licenses and restrictive agreements to establish and protect our proprietary rights in technology and products despite the precautions we may take to protect our intellectual property third parties have tried in the past and may try in the future to challenge invalidate or circumvent these safeguards the rights granted under our patents or attendant to our other intellectual property may not provide us with any competitive advantages patents may not be issued on any of our pending applications and our issued patents may not be sufficiently broad to protect our technology furthermore the laws of foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights in those countries to the same extent as applicable law protects these rights in the united states the protection of our intellectual property may require the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources moreover the steps we take to protect our intellectual property may not adequately protect our rights or prevent third parties from infringing or misappropriating our proprietary rights 

 

many of our products include software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties we may have to seek new or renew existing licenses for such software and other intellectual property in the future our engineering services business holds licenses to certain software and other intellectual property owned by third parties including that of our competitors our failure to obtain software or other intellectual property licenses or other intellectual property rights that is necessary or helpful for our business on favorable terms or the need to engage in litigation over these licenses or rights could seriously harm our business operating results or financial condition 

 

we could lose key technology or suffer serious harm to our business because of the infringement of our intellectual property rights by third parties or because of our infringement of the intellectual property rights of third parties 

 

there are numerous eda productrelated patents new patents are being issued at a rapid rate and are owned by eda companies as well as entities and individuals outside the eda industry it is not always practicable to determine in advance whether a product or any of its components infringes the patent rights of others as a result from time to time we may be compelled to respond to or prosecute intellectual property infringement claims to protect our rights or defend a customer’s rights 

 

intellectual property infringement claims including defense reimbursement obligations related to third party claims regardless of merit could consume valuable management time result in costly litigation or cause product shipment delays all of which could seriously harm our business operating results or financial condition in settling these claims we may be required to enter into royalty or licensing agreements with the third parties claiming infringement these royalty or licensing agreements if available may not have terms favorable to us being compelled to enter into a license agreement with unfavorable terms could seriously harm our business operating results or financial condition any potential intellectual property litigation could compel us to do one or more of the following 

 

 15 

  

if we were compelled to take any of these actions our business or operating results may suffer 

 

if our security measures are breached and an unauthorized party obtains access to customer data our information systems may be perceived as being unsecure and customers may curtail or stop their use of our products and services 

 

our products and services involve the storage and transmission of customers’ proprietary information and breaches of our security measures could expose us to a risk of loss or misuse of this information litigation and potential liability because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage information systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventive measures if an actual or perceived breach of our security occurs the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed and we could lose existing customers and our ability to obtain new customers 

 

the long sales cycle of our products and services makes the timing of our revenue difficult to predict and may cause our operating results to fluctuate unexpectedly 

 

generally we have a long sales cycle that can extend up to six months or longer the complexity and expense associated with our products and services generally require a lengthy customer education evaluation and approval process consequently we may incur substantial expenses and devote significant management effort and expense to develop potential relationships that do not result in agreements or revenue and may prevent us from pursuing other opportunities 

 

in addition sales of our products and services have been and may in the future be delayed if customers delay approval or commencement of projects because of 

 

  

long sales cycles for acceleration and emulation hardware products subject us to a number of significant risks over which we have limited control including insufficient excess or obsolete inventory variations in inventory valuation and fluctuations in quarterly operating results 

 

our reported financial results may be adversely affected by changes in united states generally accepted accounting principles 

 

united states generally accepted accounting principles are subject to interpretation by the financial accounting standards board or fasb the american institute of certified public accountants the sec and various bodies formed to promulgate and interpret appropriate accounting principles during fiscal 2010 the fasb issued exposure drafts of proposed accounting principles related to revenue recognition and leases which could change the way we account for certain of our transactions a change in these or other principles or interpretations could have a significant effect on our reported financial results and could affect the reporting of transactions completed before the announcement of a change in addition the sec announced a multiyear plan that could ultimately lead to the use of international financial reporting standards by united states issuers in their sec filings any such change could have a significant effect on our reported financial results 

 

the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations and other risks to our international operations may seriously harm our financial condition 

 

we have significant operations outside the united states our revenue from international operations as a percentage of total revenue was approximately 59 during fiscal 2010 57 during fiscal 2009 and 58 during fiscal 2008 a substantial portion of which is denominated in united states dollars we expect that revenue from our international operations will continue to account for a significant portion of our total revenue we also transact business in various foreign currencies primarily the japanese yen the volatility of foreign currencies in certain 

regions most notably the japanese yen european union euro british pound and indian rupee have had and may in the future have an effect on our revenue or operating results 

 

fluctuations in the rate of exchange between the united states dollar and the currencies of other countries where we conduct business could seriously affect our business operating results or financial condition for example when a foreign currency declines in value relative to the united states dollar it takes more of the foreign currency to purchase the same amount of united states dollars than before the change if we price our products and services in the foreign currency we receive fewer united states dollars than we did before the change if we price our products and services in united states dollars the decrease in value of the local currency results in an increase in the price for our products and services compared to those products of our competitors that are priced in local currency this could result in our prices being uncompetitive in markets where business is transacted in the local currency on the other hand when a foreign currency increases in value relative to the united states dollar it takes more united states dollars to purchase the same amount of the foreign currency as we use the foreign currency to pay for payroll costs and other operating expenses in our international operations this results in an increase in operating expenses 

 

exposure to foreign currency transaction risk can arise when transactions are conducted in a currency different from the functional currency of one of our subsidiaries a subsidiary’s functional currency is generally the currency in which it primarily conducts its operations including product pricing expenses and borrowings although we attempt to reduce the effect of foreign currency fluctuations significant exchange rate movements may hurt our results of operations as expressed in united states dollars 

 

our international operations may also be subject to other risks including 

 

  

we have offices throughout the world including key research and development facilities outside of the united states our operations are dependent upon the connectivity of our operations throughout the world activities that interfere with our international connectivity such as computer hacking or the introduction of a virus into our computer systems could significantly interfere with our business operations 

 

we have substantial cash requirements in the united states but a significant portion of our cash is held and generated outside of the united states and if our cash available in the united states is insufficient to meet our operating expenses and debt repayment obligations in the united states then we may be required to raise cash in ways that could negatively affect our financial condition results of operations and the market price of our common stock 

 

we have significant operations outside the united states as of january 1 2011 approximately one third of our cash and cash equivalents balance was held in accounts in the united states with the remainder of the balance held in accounts outside of the united states we believe that the combination of our existing united states cash balances and future united states operating cash flows are sufficient to meet our ongoing united states operating expenses and debt repayment obligations however if these sources of cash are insufficient to meet our future funding obligations in the united states we could be required to seek other available funding sources which could negatively impact our results of operations financial position and the market price of our common stock 

our operating results could be adversely affected as a result of changes in our effective tax rates 

 

our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by the following 

 

  

any significant change in our future effective tax rates could adversely impact our results of operations for future periods 

 

we have received examination reports from the irs proposing deficiencies in certain of our tax returns and the outcome of current and future tax examinations may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows 

 

the irs and other tax authorities regularly examine our income tax returns and the irs is currently examining our federal income tax returns for the tax years 2006 through 2008 

 

in july 2006 the irs completed its field examination of our federal income tax returns for the tax years 2000 through 2002 and issued a revenue agent’s report or rar in which the irs proposed to assess an aggregate tax deficiency for the threeyear period of approximately 3240 million in november 2006 the irs revised the proposed aggregate tax deficiency for the threeyear period to be approximately 3180 million in october 2010 the appeals office of the irs or the appeals office provided us with copies of the settlement agreements executed by the appeals office in august 2010 that resolved the previously disputed 2000 through 2002 tax positions while we did not receive the final irs determination of the amount of tax and interest that we owe prior to january 1 2011 we consider the tax positions to be effectively settled because the irs has completed its examination procedures and we believe that there is a remote possibility that the irs will reexamine the settled tax positions 

 

in may 2009 the irs completed its field examination of our federal income tax returns for the tax years 2003 through 2005 and issued a rar in which the irs proposed to assess an aggregate deficiency for the threeyear period of approximately 941 million in august 2009 the irs reduced the proposed aggregate tax deficiency for the threeyear period to approximately 607 million the irs is contesting our transfer pricing arrangements with our foreign subsidiaries and deductions for foreign trade income the irs made similar claims against our transfer pricing arrangements and deductions for foreign trade income in prior examinations and may make similar claims in its examinations of other tax years we have filed a timely protest with the irs and are seeking resolution of the issues through the appeals office we believe that the proposed irs adjustments for the tax years 2003 through 2005 are inconsistent with applicable tax laws and we are vigorously challenging these proposed adjustments although there can be no assurance that we will prevail 

 

the rars are not final statutory notices of deficiency but the irs imposes interest on the proposed deficiencies until the matters are resolved interest is compounded daily at rates published and adjusted quarterly by the irs and have been between 4 and 10 since 2001 

 

the calculation of our provision benefit for income taxes requires us to use significant judgment and involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in determining the adequacy of our provision benefit for income taxes we regularly assess the potential settlement outcomes resulting from income tax examinations however the final outcome of tax examinations including the total amount payable or 

the timing of any such payments upon resolution of these issues cannot be estimated with certainty in addition we cannot be certain that such amount will not be materially different from the amount that is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals should the irs or other tax authorities assess additional taxes as a result of a current or a future examination including the examination of the tax years 2000 through 2002 that we consider to be effectively settled we may be required to record charges to operations in future periods that could have a material impact on the results of operations financial position or cash flows in the applicable period or periods 

 

forecasting our estimated annual effective tax rate is complex and subject to uncertainty and material differences between forecasted and actual tax rates could have a material impact on our results of operations 

 

forecasts of our income tax position and resultant effective tax rate are complex and subject to uncertainty because our income tax position for each year combines the effects of estimating our annual income or loss the mix of profits and losses earned by us and our subsidiaries in tax jurisdictions with a broad range of income tax rates as well as benefits from available deferred tax assets the impact of various accounting rules and changes to these rules and results of tax audits to forecast our global tax rate pretax profits and losses by jurisdiction are estimated and tax expense by jurisdiction is calculated based on such estimates forecasts of annual income or loss that are near breakeven as we expect for fiscal 2011 will cause our estimated annual effective tax rate to be particularly sensitive to any changes to our estimates of tax expense if our estimate of the pretax profit and losses the mix of our profits and losses our ability to use deferred tax assets the results of tax audits or effective tax rates by jurisdiction is different than those estimates our actual tax rate could be materially different than forecasted which could have a material impact on our results of operations 

 

we depend on a sole supplier for certain hardware components making us vulnerable to supply shortages and price fluctuation 

 

we are dependent on a sole supplier for certain hardware components our reliance on a sole supplier could result in product delivery problems reduced control over product pricing and quality and limit our ability to identify and qualify another supplier in a timely manner while it is our goal to have multiple sources to procure certain key components in some cases it is not practical or feasible to do so we may suffer a disruption in the supply of certain hardware components if we are unable to purchase sufficient components on a timely basis or at all for any reason 

 

our operating results and revenue could be adversely affected by customer payment delays customer bankruptcies and defaults or modifications of licenses or supplier modifications 

 

as a result of the challenging economic environment in fiscal 2008 and 2009 our customers who are primarily concentrated in the semiconductor sector experienced adverse changes in their business and certain customers delayed or defaulted on their payment obligations to us if our customers experience difficulties in the future they may delay or default on their payment obligations to us file for bankruptcy or modify or cancel plans to license our products and our suppliers may significantly and quickly increase their prices or reduce their output if our customers are not successful in generating sufficient cash or are precluded from securing financing they may not be able to pay or may delay payment of accounts receivable that are owed to us although these obligations are generally not cancelable our customers’ inability to fulfill payment obligations may adversely affect our revenue and cash flow additionally our customers may seek to renegotiate preexisting contractual commitments payment defaults by our customers or significant reductions in existing contractual commitments could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results because of the relatively high levels of volatility that continue to drive significant fluctuations in asset prices as well as escalating concern regarding high levels of leverage in sovereign and corporate debt the capital and credit markets are volatile and increasingly unpredictable in this environment if we were to seek funding from the capital or credit markets in response to any material level of customer defaults we may not be able to secure funding on terms acceptable to us or at all which may have a material negative effect on our business 

we may not be able to effectively implement our restructuring plans and our restructuring plans may not result in the benefits we have anticipated possibly having a negative effect on our future operating results 

 

during fiscal 2008 fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2010 we initiated restructuring plans in an effort to decrease costs by reducing our workforce and by consolidating facilities we may not be able to successfully complete and realize the expected benefits of our restructuring plans such as improvements in operating margins and cash flows in the restructuring periods contemplated the restructuring plans have involved and may continue to involve higher costs or a longer timetable than we currently anticipate or may fail to improve our operating results as we anticipate our inability to realize these benefits may result in an inefficient business structure that could negatively affect our results of operations our restructuring plans have caused us and will cause us to incur substantial costs related to severance and other employeerelated costs our restructuring plans may also subject us to litigation risks and expenses in addition our restructuring plans may have other consequences such as attrition beyond our planned reduction in workforce a negative effect on employee morale or our ability to attract highly skilled employees and our competitors may seek to gain a competitive advantage over us the restructuring plans could also cause our remaining employees to leave or result in reduced productivity by our employees and in turn this may affect our revenue and other operating results in the future 

 

failure to obtain export licenses could harm our business by rendering us unable to ship products and transfer our technology outside of the united states 

 

we must comply with regulations of the united states and of certain other countries in shipping our software products and transferring our technology outside the united states and to foreign nationals any significant future difficulty in complying could harm our business operating results or financial condition 

 

errors or defects in our products and services could expose us to liability and harm our reputation 

 

our customers use our products and services in designing and developing products that involve a high degree of technological complexity each of which has its own specifications because of the complexity of the systems and products with which we work some of our products and designs can be adequately tested only when put to full use in the marketplace as a result our customers or their end users may discover errors or defects in our software or the systems we design or the products or systems incorporating our design and intellectual property may not operate as expected errors or defects could result in 

 

  

if we become subject to unfair hiring claims we could be prevented from hiring needed employees incur liability for damages and incur substantial costs in defending ourselves 

 

companies in our industry that lose employees to competitors frequently claim that these competitors have engaged in unfair hiring practices or that the employment of these persons would involve the disclosure or use of trade secrets these claims could prevent us from hiring employees or cause us to incur liability for damages we could also incur substantial costs in defending ourselves or our employees against these claims regardless of their merits defending ourselves from these claims could also divert the attention of our management away from our operations 

antitakeover defenses in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and certain provisions under delaware law could prevent an acquisition of our company or limit the price that investors might be willing to pay for our common stock 

 

our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and certain provisions of the delaware general corporation law that apply to us could make it difficult for another company to acquire control of our company for example 

 

  

all or any one of these factors could limit the price that certain investors would be willing to pay for shares of our common stock and could allow our board of directors to resist delay or prevent an acquisition of our company even if a proposed transaction were favored by a majority of our independent stockholders 

 

our business is subject to the risk of earthquakes 

 

our corporate headquarters including certain of our research and development operations and certain of our distribution facilities is located in the silicon valley area of northern california a region known to experience seismic activity if significant seismic activity were to occur our operations may be interrupted which could adversely impact our business and results of operations 

 

we maintain research and development and other facilities in parts of the world that are not as politically stable as the united states and as a result we may face a higher risk of business interruption from acts of war political unrest or terrorism than businesses located only or primarily in the united states 

 

we maintain international research and development and other facilities some of which are in parts of the world that are not as politically stable as the united states consequently we may face a greater risk of business interruption as a result of terrorist acts or military conflicts than businesses located domestically furthermore this potential harm is exacerbated given that damage to or disruptions at our international research and development facilities could have an adverse effect on our ability to develop new or improve existing products as compared to other businesses which may only have sales offices or other less critical operations abroad we are not insured for losses or interruptions caused by acts of war 

 

risks related to our securities and indebtedness 

 

our debt obligations expose us to risks that could adversely affect our business operating results or financial condition and could prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under such indebtedness 

 

we have a substantial level of debt as of january 1 2011 we had outstanding indebtedness with a principal balance of 6447 million as follows 

 

 21 

 

the level of our current or future indebtedness among other things could 

 

  

if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow or otherwise obtain funds necessary to make required payments or if we fail to comply with the various requirements of our indebtedness we would be in default which would permit the holders of our indebtedness to accelerate the maturity of the indebtedness and could cause defaults under any other indebtedness as well 

 

any default under our indebtedness could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition in addition a material default on our indebtedness could suspend our eligibility to register securities using certain registration statement forms under sec guidelines that permit incorporation by reference of substantial information regarding us and potentially hindering our ability to raise capital through the issuance of our securities and will increase the costs of such registration to us 

 

on the first day of fiscal 2009 we retrospectively adopted new accounting principles as required by the “debt with conversion and other options” subtopic of the fasb accounting standards codification and adjusted all periods for which the convertible senior notes were outstanding before the date of adoption this adoption had an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition particularly with respect to interest expense ratios commonly referred to by lenders and could potentially hinder our ability to raise capital through the issuance of debt or equity securities 

 

conversion of our convertible senior notes and 2015 notes into cash prior to the scheduled maturities of the notes may adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition 

 

holders of our convertible senior notes and 2015 notes may convert their notes into cash prior to the scheduled maturities of the notes upon the occurrence of certain events if one or more note holders elect to convert their notes upon the occurrence of any of these certain events we would be required to settle the converted principal through payment of cash which could adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition in addition even if note holders do not elect to convert their notes upon the occurrence of any of these certain events we would report any of our convertible senior notes or 2015 notes that are convertible at a balance sheet date as a current liability which could have a material adverse impact on our net working capital for an additional description of our convertible senior notes and 2015 notes see note 3 to our consolidated financial statements 

 

conversion of the convertible senior notes and the exercise of warrants issued concurrently with the convertible senior notes and 2015 notes will in certain circumstances dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders 

 

the terms of the convertible senior notes permit the holders to convert the convertible senior notes into shares of our common stock the terms of the convertible senior notes stipulate a net share settlement which upon conversion of the convertible senior notes requires us to pay the principal amount in cash and the conversion premium if any in shares of our common stock based on a daily settlement amount calculated on a proportionate basis for each day of the relevant 20 tradingday observation period the initial conversion rate for the convertible senior notes is 472813 shares of our common stock per 1000 principal amount of convertible senior notes equivalent to a conversion price of approximately 2115 per share of our common stock the conversion price is subject to adjustment in some events but will not be adjusted for accrued interest except in limited circumstances the conversion of some or all of the convertible senior notes will dilute the ownership interest of our existing 

stockholders any sales in the public market of the common stock issuable upon conversion could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock 

 

each 1000 of principal of the convertible senior notes is initially convertible into 472813 shares of our common stock subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events holders of the convertible senior notes may convert their notes at their option on any day before the close of business on the scheduled trading day immediately preceding december 15 2011 in the case of the 2011 notes and december 15 2013 in the case of the 2013 notes in each case only if 

 

  

from november 2 2011 in the case of the 2011 notes and november 1 2013 in the case of the 2013 notes and until the close of business on the scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date of such convertible senior notes holders may convert their convertible senior notes at any time regardless of the foregoing circumstances as of january 1 2011 none of the conditions allowing holders of the convertible senior notes to convert had been met 

 

although the conversion price of the convertible senior notes is 2115 per share we entered into separate hedge and warrant transactions concurrent with the issuance of the convertible senior notes to reduce the potential dilution from the conversion of the convertible senior notes 

 

additionally although the 2015 notes are only convertible into cash we entered into separate hedge and warrant transactions concurrent with the issuance of the 2015 notes to reduce the potential cash outlay from the conversion of the 2015 notes however we cannot guarantee that the hedge and warrant instruments issued concurrently with the convertible senior notes will fully mitigate the potential dilution from the convertible senior notes or that the warrants issued concurrently with the 2015 notes will not result in dilution the warrants could have a dilutive effect to the extent that the market price per share of our common stock as measured under the terms of the warrants exceeds the strike price of the warrants in addition the existence of the convertible senior notes and the 2015 notes may encourage short selling by market participants because the conversion of the convertible senior notes could depress the price of our common stock 

 

at the option of the holders of the convertible senior notes and the 2015 notes under certain circumstances we may be required to repurchase the convertible senior notes or the 2015 notes in cash 

 

under the terms of the convertible senior notes and the 2015 notes we may be required to repurchase the convertible senior notes and the 2015 notes following a “fundamental change” in our corporate ownership or structure such as a change of control in which substantially all of the consideration does not consist of publicly traded securities prior to maturity of the convertible senior notes and the 2015 notes the repurchase price for the convertible senior notes and the 2015 notes in the event of a fundamental change must be paid solely in cash this repayment obligation may have the effect of discouraging delaying or preventing a takeover of our company that may otherwise be beneficial to investors 

 

hedge and warrant transactions entered into in connection with the issuance of the convertible senior notes and the 2015 notes may affect the value of our common stock 

 

we entered into hedge transactions with various financial institutions at the time of issuance of the convertible senior notes and the 2015 notes with the objective of reducing the potential dilutive effect of issuing our common stock upon conversion of the convertible senior notes and the potential cash outlay from the cash conversion of the 2015 notes we also entered into separate warrant transactions with the same financial institutions in connection with our hedge and warrant transactions associated with the convertible senior notes and the 2015 notes these financial institutions purchased our common stock in secondary market transactions and entered into various 

overthecounter derivative transactions with respect to our common stock these entities or their affiliates are likely to modify their hedge positions from time to time prior to conversion or maturity of the convertible senior notes and the 2015 notes by purchasing and selling shares of our common stock other of our securities or other instruments they may wish to use in connection with such hedging any of these transactions and activities could adversely affect the value of our common stock and as a result the number of shares and the value of the common stock that convertible senior notes holders will receive upon conversion of the convertible senior notes and the amount of cash that 2015 notes holders will receive upon conversion of the 2015 notes in addition subject to movement in the price of our common stock if the hedge transactions settle in our favor we could be exposed to credit risk related to the other party with respect to the payment we are owed from such other party if the financial institutions with which we entered into these hedge transactions were to fail or default our ability to settle on these transactions could be harmed or delayed 

 

we are subject to the risk that the hedge participants cannot or do not fulfill their obligations under the convertible senior notes hedge transactions and the 2015 notes hedge transactions 

 

global economic conditions have resulted in the actual or perceived failure or financial difficulties of many financial institutions if any of the participants in the hedge transactions is unwilling or unable to perform its obligations for any reason we would not be able to receive the benefit of such transaction we cannot provide any assurances as to the financial stability or viability of any of the participants in the hedge transactions 

 

rating agencies may provide unsolicited ratings on the convertible senior notes and the 2015 notes that could reduce the market value or liquidity of our convertible senior notes 2015 notes or our common stock 

 

we have not requested a rating of the convertible senior notes or the 2015 notes from any rating agency and we do not anticipate that the convertible senior notes or the 2015 notes will be rated however if one or more rating agencies independently elects to rate the convertible senior notes or the 2015 notes and assigns the convertible senior notes or the 2015 notes a rating lower than the rating expected by investors or reduces such rating in the future the market price or liquidity of the convertible senior notes or the 2015 notes as the case may be and our common stock could be harmed should a decline in the market price of the convertible senior notes or the 2015 notes result as compared to the price of our common stock this may trigger the right of the holders of the convertible senior notes or the 2015 notes to convert such notes into cash and shares of our common stock as applicable

any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount or the range of loss can be estimated we accrue a liability for the estimated loss legal proceedings are subject to uncertainties and the outcomes are difficult to predict because of such uncertainties accruals are based on our judgments using the best information available at the time as additional information becomes available we reassess the potential liability related to pending claims and litigation matters and may revise our estimates 

 

on february 8 2011 and february 11 2011 we agreed to settle our pending derivative and securities litigation respectively subject to completion of final settlement documentation by the parties and court approval accordingly we recorded litigation charges of 158 million in fiscal 2010 see note 15 to our consolidated financial statements for an additional description of our legal proceedings and this settlement

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

 

the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k and with item 1a “risk factors” please refer to the cautionary language at the beginning of part i of this annual report on form 10k regarding forwardlooking statements 

 

business overview 

 

we develop eda software hardware and silicon ip we license software and ip sell or lease hardware technology provide maintenance for our software ip and hardware and provide engineering and education services throughout the world to help manage and accelerate product development processes for electronics our customers use our products and services to design and develop complex ics and electronics systems during fiscal 2010 we had orders of 956 million 

 

we primarily generate revenue from licensing our eda software and ip selling or leasing our hardware technology providing maintenance for our products and providing engineering services substantially all of our revenue is generated from ic and electronics systems manufacturers and designers and is dependent upon their commencement of new design projects as a result our revenue is significantly influenced by our customers’ business outlook and investment in the introduction of new products and the improvement of existing products 

 

critical accounting estimates 

 

in preparing our consolidated financial statements we make assumptions judgments and estimates that can have a significant impact on our revenue operating income loss and net income loss as well as on the value of certain assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets we base our assumptions judgments and estimates on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions at least quarterly we evaluate our assumptions judgments and estimates and make changes accordingly historically our assumptions judgments and estimates relative to our critical accounting estimates have not differed materially from actual results we believe that the assumptions judgments and estimates involved in the accounting for revenue recognition accounting for income taxes allowance for doubtful accounts valuation of intangible assets valuation of goodwill and fair value have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements therefore we consider these to be our critical accounting estimates for information on our significant accounting policies see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements 

 

revenue recognition 

 

we begin to recognize revenue from licensing and supporting our software ip and hardware products when all of the following criteria are met 

 

  

significant judgment is involved in the determination of whether the facts and circumstances of an arrangement support that the fee for the arrangement is considered to be fixed or determinable and that collectibility of the fee is probable and these judgments can affect the amount of revenue that we recognize in a particular reporting period we must also make these judgments when assessing whether a contract amendment to a term arrangement primarily in the context of a license extension or renewal constitutes a concession our experience has been that we are able to determine whether a fee is fixed or determinable for term licenses and we have established a history of collecting under the original contract without providing concessions on payments products or services 

for installment contracts that do not include a substantial upfront payment we consider that a fee is fixed or determinable only if the arrangement has payment periods that are equal to or less than the term of the licenses and the payments are collected in equal or nearly equal installments when evaluated over the entire term of the arrangement while we do not expect that experience to change if we no longer were to have a history of collecting under the original contract without providing concessions on term licenses revenue from term licenses would be required to be recognized when payments under the installment contract become due and payable such a change could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

 

our experience has been that we are generally able to estimate whether collection is probable significant judgment is applied as we assess the creditworthiness of our customers to make this determination if our experience were to change such a change could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations if in our judgment collection of a fee is not probable we defer the revenue until the uncertainty is removed which generally means revenue is recognized upon receipt of cash payment from the customer 

 

a multiple element arrangement or mea is any arrangement that includes or contemplates rights to a combination of software or hardware products software license types services training or maintenance in a single arrangement from time to time we may include individual deliverables in separately priced and separately signed contracts with the same customer we obtain and evaluate all known relevant facts and circumstances in determining whether the separate contracts should be accounted for individually as distinct arrangements or whether the separate contracts are in substance a mea significant judgment can be involved in determining whether a group of contracts might be so closely related that they are in effect part of a single arrangement 

 

for our subscription licenses including “eda platinum cards” the software license agreements typically combine the right to use specified software products the right to maintenance and the right to receive and use unspecified future software products for no additional fee when and if available during the term of the license agreement under these license agreements when all four of the revenue recognition criteria outlined above are met we recognize revenue ratably over the term of the license agreement beginning with delivery of the products subscription license revenue is allocated to product and maintenance revenue the allocation to maintenance revenue is based on the average substantive renewal rates included in the sale of similar term license arrangements in the event that the license fee for this type of arrangement is not considered to be fixed or determinable at the outset of the arrangement we recognize revenue at the lesser of i the prorata portion of the license fee for the applicable period or ii as payments from the customer become due if all other conditions for revenue recognition have been satisfied 

 

for term and perpetual licenses including “eda gold cards” that include a stated annual maintenance renewal rate software license fees are recognized as revenue “upfront” when all four of the revenue recognition criteria outlined above are met generally upon delivery and the maintenance fees are recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance period under our current business model a relatively small percentage of our revenue from software licenses is recognized on an upfront basis 

 

license agreements under which license fees are recognized upfront do not include the right to receive unspecified future products however when such license agreements are executed within close proximity or in contemplation of other license agreements that require ratable revenue recognition with the same customer the licenses together may be deemed a mea in which event all such revenue is recognized over multiple periods 

 

revenue from service contracts is recognized either on the time and materials method as work is performed or on the percentageofcompletion method for contracts with fixed or nottoexceed fees we estimate on a monthly basis the percentage of completion based on the completion of milestones relating to the arrangement we have a history of accurately estimating project status and the costs necessary to complete projects a number of internal and external factors can affect our estimates including labor rates utilization and efficiency variances and specification and testing requirement changes if different conditions were to prevail such that accurate estimates could not be made then the use of the completed contract method would be required and the recognition of all revenue and costs would be deferred until the project was completed such a change could have a material impact on our results of operations 

accounting for income taxes 

 

we provide for the effect of income taxes in our consolidated financial statements using the asset and liability method we also apply a twostep approach to determining the financial statement recognition and measurement of uncertain tax positions 

 

income tax expense or benefit is recognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and for deferred tax assets and liabilities for the tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity’s financial statements or tax returns we must make significant assumptions judgments and estimates to determine our current provision benefit for income taxes our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance to be recorded against our deferred tax assets our judgments assumptions and estimates relating to the current provision benefit for income taxes include the geographic mix and amount of income loss our interpretation of current tax laws and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax authorities our judgments also include anticipating the tax positions we will take on tax returns before actually preparing and filing the tax returns changes in our business tax laws or our interpretation of tax laws and developments in current and future tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our results of operations financial position or cash flows 

 

deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to tax benefit carryforwards and to differences between the financial statement amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis we regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized to make this assessment we take into account predictions of the amount and category of taxable income from various sources and all available positive and negative evidence about these possible sources of taxable income the weight given to the potential effect of negative and positive evidence is commensurate with the extent to which the strength of the evidence can be objectively verified for example a company’s current year or previous year losses are given more weight than its future outlook for the years ended january 1 2011 and january 2 2010 we concluded that a significant valuation allowance was required based on our evaluation and weighting of the positive and negative evidence if in the future we determine that these deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized a release of all or part of the related valuation allowance could result in a material income tax benefit in the period such determination is made for an additional description of the valuation allowance see note 6 to our consolidated financial statements 

 

we only recognize an income tax position in our financial statements that we judge is more likely than not to be sustained solely on its technical merits in a tax audit including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes to make this judgment we must interpret complex and sometimes ambiguous tax laws regulations and administrative practices if an income tax position meets the more likely than not recognition threshold then we must measure the amount of the tax benefit to be recognized by determining the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than a 50 likelihood of being realized upon effective settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all of the relevant facts it is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts as this requires us to determine the probability of various possible settlement outcomes to determine if a tax position is effectively settled we must also estimate the likelihood that a taxing authority would review a tax position after a tax examination has otherwise been completed we must also determine when it is reasonably possible that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits will significantly increase or decrease in the 12 months after each fiscal yearend these judgments are difficult because a taxing authority may change its behavior as a result of our disclosures in our financial statements or for other reasons we must reevaluate our income tax positions on a quarterly basis to consider factors such as changes in facts or circumstances changes in tax law effectively settled issues under audit and new audit activity such a change in recognition or measurement would result in recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision in addition we are required by the irs to disclose uncertain tax positions taken on our federal tax return for fiscal 2010 

 

we are also required to assess whether the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries will be indefinitely reinvested outside the united states as of january 1 2011 we had recognized a deferred tax liability of 52 million related to 86 million of earnings from certain foreign subsidiaries that are not considered indefinitely invested outside the united states changes in our actual or projected operating results tax laws or our interpretation of tax laws foreign 

exchange rates and developments in current and future tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our results of operations financial position or cash flows 

 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

 

we make judgments as to our ability to collect outstanding receivables and provide allowances for a portion of receivables when collection becomes doubtful this allowance is based on our assessment of the creditworthiness of our customers historical experience and the overall economic climate of the industries that we serve while we believe that our allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate we continue to monitor customer liquidity and other economic conditions which may result in changes to our estimates regarding our ability to collect from our customers changes in circumstances such as an unexpected change in a customer’s ability to meet its financial obligation to us or a customer’s payment trends are hard to predict and may require us to adjust our estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to us these changes could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

 

during fiscal 2009 we increased the allowance for doubtful accounts by 216 million as a result of our assessment of the increased risk of customer delays or defaults on payment obligations as a result of receiving payments related to a portion of the outstanding receivables against which we had previously recorded allowances we have decreased our allowance for doubtful accounts to 76 million as of january 1 2011 as compared to 237 million as of january 2 2010 of the 76 million allowance for doubtful accounts as of january 1 2011 69 million relates to one customer whose outstanding gross accounts receivable balance is due in the first half of 2011 if we recover any portion of that 69 million it will result in a reduction of our operating expenses 

 

valuation of intangible assets 

 

when we acquire businesses we allocate the purchase price to acquired tangible assets and liabilities and acquired identifiable intangible assets any residual purchase price is recorded as goodwill the allocation of the purchase price requires us to make significant estimates in determining the fair values of these acquired assets and assumed liabilities especially with respect to intangible assets these estimates are based on information obtained from management of the acquired companies our assessment of this information and historical experience these estimates can include but are not limited to the cash flows that an asset is expected to generate in the future the appropriate weightedaverage cost of capital and the cost savings expected to be derived from acquiring an asset these estimates are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and if different estimates were used the purchase price for the acquisition could be allocated to the acquired assets and liabilities differently from the allocation that we have made in addition unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that may affect the accuracy or validity of such estimates and if such events occur we may be required to adjust the value allocated to acquired assets or assumed liabilities 

 

we assess the impairment of longlived assets including certain identifiable intangibles whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that we will not be able to recover an asset’s carrying amount in addition we assess our longlived assets for impairment if they are abandoned 

 

for longlived assets to be held and used including acquired intangibles we initiate our review whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a longlived asset may not be recoverable recoverability of an asset is measured by comparing its carrying amount to the expected future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of that asset excluding future interest costs that would be recognized as an expense when incurred any impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair market value significant management judgment is required in 

 

  

in future periods material impairment charges could be necessary should different conditions prevail or different judgments be made 

valuation of goodwill 

 

costs in excess of the fair value of tangible and other intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination are recorded as goodwill goodwill is not amortized but instead is tested for impairment at least annually we evaluate goodwill on an annual basis and whenever events and changes in circumstances suggest that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 

 

impairment of goodwill is tested at the reporting unit level by comparing the reporting unit’s carrying amount including goodwill to the fair value of the reporting unit the fair values of the reporting units are estimated using a combination of the income or discounted cash flows approach and the market approach which utilizes comparable companies’ data if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value goodwill is considered to be impaired and a second step is performed to measure the amount of the impairment loss 

 

the preparation of the goodwill impairment analysis requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions with respect to the determination of fair values of the reporting unit and tangible and intangible assets these estimates and assumptions which include future values are complex and often subjective and may differ significantly from period to period based on changes in the overall economic environment changes in our industry and changes in our strategy or our internal forecasts estimates and assumptions with respect to the fair value determination include 

 

  

these estimates and assumptions along with others are used to estimate the fair value of our reporting unit as well as tangible and intangible assets while we believe the estimates and assumptions we use are reasonable different assumptions may materially impact the resulting fair value of the reporting unit tangible assets and intangible assets the amount of impairment we record in any given period and our results of operations 

 

we completed our annual goodwill impairment test during the third quarter of fiscal 2010 and determined that the fair value of our single reporting unit substantially exceeded the carrying amount of our net assets and that no impairment existed 

 

financial instruments and fair value 

 

inputs to valuation techniques are observable or unobservable observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources while unobservable inputs reflect our market assumptions these two types of inputs have created the following fairvalue hierarchy 

 

  

this hierarchy requires us to minimize the use of unobservable inputs and to use observable market data if available when determining fair value we recognize transfers between levels of this hierarchy based on the fair values of the respective financial instruments at the end of the reporting period in which the transfer occurred changes in fair value are recognized in earnings each period for financial instruments that are carried at fair value 

 

the types of instruments that trade in markets that are not considered to be active but are valued based on quoted market prices broker or dealer quotations or alternative pricing sources with reasonable levels of price transparency are generally classified within level 2 of the fair value hierarchy 

in june 2010 we entered into hedge transactions or the 2015 notes hedges and recorded an embedded conversion derivative or the 2015 notes embedded conversion derivative concurrent with the issuance of the 2015 notes the fair values of these derivatives are determined using an option pricing model based on observable inputs such as implied volatility of our common stock riskfree interest rate and other factors and as such are classified within level 2 of the fair value hierarchy for an additional description of these transactions see note 3 to our consolidated financial statements 

 

certain instruments are classified within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy because they trade infrequently and therefore have little or no price transparency for those instruments that are not traded in active markets or are subject to transfer restrictions valuations are adjusted to reflect illiquidity andor nontransferability and such adjustments are generally based on available market evidence in the absence of such evidence our best estimate is used 

 

results of operations 

 

overview of fiscal 2010 

 

financial results for fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008 reflect the following 

 

  

acquisition of denali 

 

in june 2010 we acquired denali a privatelyheld provider of electronic design automation software and intellectual property used in systemonchip design and verification for 2968 million in cash an additional 126 million of payments were deferred on the acquisition date and conditioned upon certain denali shareholders remaining employees of cadence during the periods specified in the respective agreements as of january 1 2011 105 million of the 126 million has been paid during fiscal 2010 102 million of the 126 million was expensed in our consolidated statements of operations the remaining 24 million will be expensed in our consolidated statements of operations over the stated retention periods the denali ® product portfolio includes memory models design ip and verification ip the impact of the denali acquisition on our statement of operations in fiscal 2010 resulted in a greater increase in our operating expenses than the increase in revenue generated from the acquisition 

revenue 

 

we primarily generate revenue from licensing our eda software and ip selling or leasing our hardware technology providing maintenance for our software ip and hardware and providing engineering services we principally use three license types subscription term and perpetual the different license types provide a customer with different conditions of use for our products such as 

 

  

the timing of our product revenue is significantly affected by the mix of orders executed in any given period for some orders such as subscription orders product and maintenance revenue is recognized ratably over multiple periods in addition depending on the individual facts and circumstances of a particular order we have some orders for which product and maintenance revenue is recognized as payments become due and some for which revenue is only recognized when payment is received for other orders all product revenue is recognized upfront in the same quarter in which the order is executed 

 

we seek to achieve a mix of orders with approximately 90 of the total value of all executed orders consisting of orders for which the revenue is recurring or ratable in nature with the balance of the orders made up of orders for which the product revenue is recognized upfront our ability to achieve this ratable orders mix may be impacted by an increase in hardware sales beyond our current expectations for an additional description of the impact of hardware sales on the anticipated mix of orders see “new accounting standards” below 

 

during fiscal 2010 approximately 90 of the total value of our executed orders was comprised of ratable revenue orders approximately 90 of our fiscal 2010 revenue came from ratable orders 

 

customer decisions regarding these aspects of license transactions determine the license type timing of revenue recognition and potential future business activity for example if a customer chooses a fixed duration of use this will result in either a subscription or term license a business implication of this decision is that at the expiration of the license period the customer must decide whether to continue using the technology and therefore renew the license agreement historically larger customers generally have used products from two or more of our five product groups and rarely completely terminated their relationship with us upon expiration of the license see the discussion under the heading “critical accounting estimates – revenue recognition” and note 2 of our consolidated financial statements for additional descriptions of license types and timing of revenue recognition 

 

although we believe that pricing volatility has not generally been a material component of the change in our revenue from period to period we believe that the amount of revenue recognized in future periods will depend on among other things the 

 

   

the value and renewal of contracts and consequently product revenue recognized is affected by the competitiveness of our products product revenue recognized in any period is also affected by the extent to which customers purchase subscription term or perpetual licenses and the extent to which contracts contain flexible payment terms 

 

revenue mix 

we analyze our software ip and hardware businesses by product group combining revenues for both product and maintenance because of their interrelationship we have formulated a design solution strategy that combines our design technologies in “platforms” as described in the various product groups below 

 

functional verification  products in this group including the incisive functional verification platform are used to verify that the high level logical representation of an ic design is functionally correct and for verification at the system and soc levels our emulation hardware products verification ip products memory subsystem models and silicon ip products are included in this product group as are the products acquired through the denali acquisition 

 

digital ic design  products in this group including the encounter digital ic design platform are used to create and convert the highlevel logical representation of a digital ic into a detailed physical blueprint and then detailed design information showing how the ic will be physically implemented this data is used for creation of the photomasks used to manufacture semiconductors 

 

custom ic design  our custom design products including the virtuoso custom design platform are used for ics that must be designed at the transistor level including analog rf memory high performance digital blocks and standard cell libraries included in this group are specialized verification products that simulate the operation of the design prior to manufacturing detailed design information showing how an ic will be physically implemented is used for creation of the photomasks used to manufacture semiconductors 

 

system interconnect design  this product group consists of our pcb and ic package design products including the allegro and orcad ® products the allegro system interconnect design platform enables consistent codesign of interconnects across ics ic packages and pcbs while the orcad line focuses on costeffective entrylevel pcb solutions 

 

design for manufacturing  included in this product group are our physical verification and analysis products these products are used to analyze and verify that the physical blueprint of the ic has been constructed correctly and can be manufactured successfully our strategy includes focusing on integrating dfm awareness into our core design platforms of encounter digital ic design and virtuoso custom ic design 

 

for an additional description of our current product strategy see the discussion under the heading “products and product strategy” under item 1 “business” 

 

revenue by year 

 

the following table shows our revenue for fiscal 2010 fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008 and the dollar change in revenue between years 

 

 

 

product revenue increased during fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 primarily because of higher business levels due to the timing of contract renewals with existing customers and from contracts executed in prior quarters due to our continued transition to a ratable license mix we expect to recognize increased revenue during fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 due to higher business levels and our continued transition to our more ratable license mix 

 

product revenue decreased during fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 primarily because of lower business levels due to the challenges in the macroeconomic environment the timing of our contract renewals with existing customers our transition to a ratable license mix and a longer sales cycle 

services revenue decreased during fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 primarily because of lower business levels in the services business services revenue decreased during fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 because of lower business levels due to the challenges in the macroeconomic environment and an increase in the proportion of arrangements for which revenue is deferred until payments become due and payable or cash is received from customers primarily as a result of our assessment of the increased risk of customer delays or defaults on payment obligations 

 

maintenance revenue increased during fiscal 2010 as compared to 2009 primarily because of higher business levels due to the timing of contract renewals with existing customers 

 

maintenance revenue decreased during fiscal 2009 as compared to 2008 due to lower business levels as a result of challenges in the macroeconomic environment an increase in the proportion of arrangements for which revenue is deferred until payments become due and payable or cash is received from customers primarily as a result of our assessment of the increased risk of customer delays or defaults on payment obligations and a decline in maintenance fees resulting from a reduction in the average duration of software license arrangements because the annual fee for maintenance is lower for arrangements with shorter durations 

 

the following table shows the percentage of product and related maintenance revenue contributed by each of our five product groups and services and other during fiscal 2010 fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008 

 

 

 

as described in note 2 of our consolidated financial statements certain of our licensing arrangements allow customers the ability to remix among software products additionally we have arrangements with customers that include a combination of our products with the actual product selection and number of licensed users to be determined at a later date for these arrangements we estimate the allocation of the revenue to product groups based upon the expected usage of our products the actual usage of our products by these customers may differ and if that proves to be the case the revenue allocation in the table above would differ 

 

although we believe the methodology of allocating revenue to product groups is reasonable there can be no assurance that such allocated amounts reflect the amounts that would result had the customer individually licensed each specific software solution at the onset of the arrangement 

 

revenue by geography 

 

 

revenue by geography as a percentage of total revenue 

 

 

 

no single customer accounted for 10 or more of total revenue during fiscal 2010 fiscal 2009 or fiscal 2008 

 

most of our revenue is transacted in the united states dollar however certain revenue transactions are in foreign currencies primarily the japanese yen and we recognize additional revenue in periods when the united states dollar weakens in value against the japanese yen and reduced revenue in periods when the united states dollar strengthens against the japanese yen for an additional description of how changes in foreign exchange rates affect our consolidated financial statements see the discussion under the heading “item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk – disclosures about market risk – foreign currency risk” 

 

stockbased compensation expense summary 

 

stockbased compensation expense is reflected in our costs and expenses during fiscal 2010 fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008 as follows 

 

 

 

stockbased compensation expense decreased by 112 million during fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 and decreased by 266 million during fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 due to the following 

 

  

effects of restructuring plans 

 

during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 we initiated a restructuring plan or the 2010 restructuring plan which we announced in february 2011 the 2010 restructuring plan is intended to decrease costs by reducing our workforce throughout the company by approximately 95 positions we expect ongoing annual savings of 145 million related to the 2010 restructuring plan we expect that substantially all of the estimated restructuring planrelated annual operating expense savings related to the 2010 restructuring activities will be offset by increased costs in connection with developing and enhancing our product technologies 

 

during fiscal 2009 we initiated a restructuring plan or the 2009 restructuring plan to improve our operating results and to align our cost structure with expected revenue the 2009 restructuring plan reduced our workforce throughout the company by approximately 345 positions 

during fiscal 2008 we initiated a restructuring plan to improve our operating results and to align our cost structure with expected revenue this restructuring plan reduced our workforce throughout the company by approximately 625 positions see note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for additional details of the 2010 2009 and 2008 restructuring plans 

 

cost of revenue 

 

 

 

the following table shows cost of revenue as a percentage of related revenue for fiscal 2010 fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008 

 

 

 

cost of services as a percentage of services revenue increased during fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 primarily due to decreased services revenue during fiscal 2009 as noted above 

 

cost of product 

 

cost of product includes costs associated with the sale or lease of our hardware and licensing of our software and ip products cost of product primarily includes the cost of employee salary benefits and other employeerelated costs including stockbased compensation expense amortization of acquired intangibles directly related to our products the cost of technical documentation and royalties payable to thirdparty vendors cost of product associated with our hardware products also includes materials assembly and overhead these additional manufacturing costs make our cost of hardware product higher as a percentage of revenue than our cost of software and ip products 

 

a summary of cost of product during fiscal 2010 fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008 is as follows 

 

 

cost of product decreased by 07 million during fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 and decreased by 182 million during fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 due to the following 

 

 

 

hardware costs decreased during fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 primarily due to a decrease in hardware sales and a writeoff of obsolete inventory that did not recur during fiscal 2009 

 

amortization of acquired intangibles included in cost of product increased during fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 due to amortization of intangible assets associated with the denali acquisition amortization of acquired intangibles included in cost of product decreased during fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 due to the impairment of certain acquired intangibles during fiscal 2008 

 

cost of product depends primarily upon the extent to which we acquire intangible assets acquire licenses and incorporate thirdparty technology in our products that are licensed or sold in any given period and the actual mix of hardware and software product sales in any given period 

 

we expect cost of product to increase in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 due to expected increases in hardware revenue in 2011 and due to a full year of amortization of intangible assets associated with the denali acquisition 

 

cost of services 

 

cost of services primarily includes employee salary benefits and other employeerelated costs costs to maintain the infrastructure necessary to manage a services organization and provisions for contract losses if any cost of services decreased by 75 million during fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 and decreased by 128 million during fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 due to the following 

 

 

 

cost of maintenance 

 

cost of maintenance includes the cost of customer services such as telephonic and onsite support employee salary benefits and other employeerelated costs and documentation of maintenance updates as well as amortization of intangible assets directly related to our maintenance contracts cost of maintenance decreased 

by 45 million during fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 and decreased by 92 million during fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 due to the following 

 

 

 

amortization of acquired intangibles decreased by 31 million during fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 because certain acquired intangible assets became fully amortized 

 

operating expenses 

 

 

 

the increase in our operating expenses during fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 is primarily due to higher employeerelated costs including the additional costs related to our acquisition of denali which primarily affected our research and development expenses these costs include ongoing denali operating expenses and expenses related to deferred denali acquisition payments see note 4 to our consolidated financial statements for an additional description of the deferred denali acquisition payments 

 

our operating expenses also increased during fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 due to higher salary commissions benefits and other employeerelated costs because of improved business levels that resulted in increased sales commissions and other employee incentive compensation 

 

the increases in operating expenses related to our acquisition of denali and increased employeerelated costs were partially offset by the decrease in bad debt expense during fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 that we recorded in our general and administrative expenses and by decreased employeerelated costs due to our restructuring activities bad debt expense decreased by 381 million during fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 due to recording allowances for doubtful accounts of 216 million during fiscal 2009 and releasing 165 million of the reserve during fiscal 2010 as a result of collections on certain receivables that were previously included in our allowance for doubtful accounts 

 

operating expenses decreased during fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 primarily due to reduced headcount and related costs as a result of our 2008 and 2009 restructuring plans and our cost savings initiatives to reduce discretionary spending in addition fiscal 2008 was a 53week fiscal year while fiscal 2009 was a 52week fiscal year 

 

we expect operating expenses to increase in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 due to the significant release of our allowances for doubtful accounts in fiscal 2010 which we do not expect to recur in fiscal 2011 we also expect increases in salary commissions benefits and other employeerelated costs in fiscal 2011 as compared 

to fiscal 2010 because we expect to include a full year of expenses associated with the employment of former denali employees and also expect the anticipated improvements in our business to result in higher incentive compensation 

 

the following table shows operating expenses as a percentage of total revenue for fiscal 2010 fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008 

 

 

 

marketing and sales 

 

marketing and sales expense increased by 188 million during fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 and decreased by 716 million during fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 due to the following 

 

 

 

research and development 

 

research and development expense increased by 217 million during fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 and decreased by 1032 million during fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 due to the following 

 

 

 

salary benefits and other employeerelated costs included in research and development expense include operating expenses associated with deferred denali acquisition payments we recorded research and development 

expense of 102 million related to these deferred denali acquisition payments during fiscal 2010 see note 4 to our consolidated financial statements for an additional description of the deferred denali acquisition payments 

 

general and administrative 

 

general and administrative expense decreased by 363 million during fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 and decreased by 293 million during fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 due to the following 

 

 

 

bad debt expense decreased by 381 million during fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 due to recording allowances for doubtful accounts of 216 million during fiscal 2009 and releasing 165 million of the reserve during fiscal 2010 as a result of collections on certain receivables that were previously included in our allowance for doubtful accounts see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for an additional description of our allowance for doubtful accounts 

 

legal and other professional services costs decreased during fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 primarily due to a decrease in professional services fees related to our proposed acquisition of mentor graphics corporation and the restatement of our previously issued financial statements for the periods ended march 29 2008 and june 28 2008 that did not recur during fiscal 2009 for an additional description of our current litigation see note 15 to our consolidated financial statements 

 

losses on the sale of installment contract receivables decreased during fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 due to a reduction in sales of receivables the change in our license mix has resulted in an increased number of subscription licenses and a decrease in the sale of receivables to financial institutions because we generally do not sell the receivables associated with subscription licenses 

 

executive severance costs during fiscal 2008 relate to the cash payable to three of the five executives who resigned in october 2008 the expense related to the other two resignations of executives is included in our sales and marketing and research and development expenses 

 

we expect general and administrative expenses to increase in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 due to the significant release of our allowances for doubtful accounts in fiscal 2010 which we do not expect to recur in fiscal 2011 

amortization of acquired intangibles 

 

 

 

amortization of acquired intangibles increased 28 million during fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 and decreased 113 million during fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 due to the following 

 

 

 

we expect amortization of acquired intangibles to increase in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 due to a full year of amortization of intangible assets associated with the denali acquisition 

 

restructuring and other charges 

 

we have initiated multiple restructuring plans since 2001 including a 2010 restructuring plan see note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for an additional description of these restructuring plans 

 

because the restructuring charges and related benefits are derived from management’s estimates made during the formulation of the restructuring plans based on thencurrently available information our restructuring plans may not achieve the benefits anticipated on the timetable or at the level contemplated demand for our products and services and ultimately our future financial performance is difficult to predict with any degree of certainty accordingly additional actions including further restructuring of our operations may be required in the future 

 

2010 restructuring plan 

 

during fiscal 2010 we recorded restructuring and other charges associated with the 2010 restructuring plan of 132 million of the 132 million 91 million is comprised of estimated severance payments severancerelated benefits and costs for outplacement services that we determined were both probable and estimable as of january 1 2011 the costs relate to approximately 95 employees who were notified after january 1 2011 all of the 91 million of accrued severance and associated benefits is included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet as of january 1 2011 because of varying regulations in the jurisdictions and countries in which we operate these workforce reductions will be realized during fiscal 2011 and are expected to be completed by the end of fiscal 2011 

 

as part of the 2010 restructuring plan we determined we would change our research and development plans related to certain purchased software technology and related assets we evaluated the net realizable value of these assets and recorded an impairment charge of 35 million 

 

during fiscal 2010 and as part of the 2010 restructuring plan we recorded a lease loss accrual of 04 million related to a facility we consolidated and had vacated prior to january 1 2011 we expect to record an additional 10 million to 20 million in restructuring expenses related to consolidating facilities included in the 2010 restructuring plan as we vacate those facilities in future periods 

we expect ongoing annual savings of 145 million related to the restructuring activities we initiated during the fourth quarter of 2010 and announced in february 2011 we expect that substantially all of the estimated restructuring planrelated annual operating expense savings related to the 2010 restructuring activities will be offset by increased costs in connection with developing and enhancing our product technologies 

 

the following table presents restructuring and other charges for the 2010 restructuring plan 

 

 

 

2009 restructuring plan 

 

the following table presents restructuring and other charges for the 2009 restructuring plan 

 

 

 

we have recorded total costs associated with the 2009 restructuring plan of 317 million primarily related to severance payments severancerelated benefits and costs for outplacement services as of january 1 2011 we had paid substantially all of the severance payments related to the 2009 restructuring plan 

 

during fiscal 2010 we recorded a net credit of 34 million consisting of a credit of 39 million in termination and related benefits costs that were less than initially estimated and a 04 million charge related to facilities included in the 2009 restructuring plan that we vacated during the first quarter of fiscal 2010 and 01 million for assets related to these vacated facilities 

 

2008 restructuring plan 

 

the following table presents restructuring and other charges for the 2008 restructuring plan 

 

 

 

we have recorded total costs associated with the 2008 restructuring plan of 443 million primarily related to severance payments severancerelated benefits and costs for outplacement services as of january 1 2011 we had paid substantially all of the severance payments related to the 2008 restructuring plan 

other restructuring plans 

 

the following table presents restructuring and other charges for the other restructuring plans 

 

 

 

the activity in the other restructuring plans in each of fiscal 2010 fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008 relates solely to changes in estimates related to lease loss accruals 

 

litigation charges 

 

on february 8 2011 and february 11 2011 we agreed to settle our pending derivative and securities litigation respectively subject to completion of final settlement documentation by the parties and court approval accordingly we recorded litigation charges of 158 million in fiscal 2010 which is total settlement costs of 400 million net of 242 million we expect will be paid by our insurance carriers see note 15 to our consolidated financial statements for an additional description of our legal proceedings and this settlement 

 

impairment of goodwill 

 

we conduct a goodwill impairment analysis annually and as necessary if changes in facts and circumstances indicate that the fair value of our reporting unit may be less than the carrying amount we completed an interim goodwill impairment test during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 and recorded an impairment of goodwill of 13172 million representing all of our goodwill at that time for an additional description of our impairment of goodwill see note 5 to our consolidated financial statements 

 

impairment of intangible and tangible assets 

 

in connection with our cost savings initiatives that were implemented during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 we made certain changes to our dfm product strategy as a result we recognized an impairment charge of 425 million arising from the abandonment of certain identifiable intangible assets and reducing to net realizable value certain other identifiable intangible assets we also abandoned and impaired 46 million of other longlived assets during fiscal 2008 

 

interest expense 

 

 

the increase in interest expense during fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 is due to interest expense related to the 2015 notes that were issued in june 2010 for an additional description of our 2015 notes and convertible senior notes see note 3 to our consolidated financial statements 

 

we expect to incur a full year of interest expense related to the 2015 notes during fiscal 2011 as a result we expect interest expense to increase in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 

 

other income expense net 

 

other income expense net for fiscal 2010 fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008 was as follows 

 

 

 

during fiscal 2010 we recorded gains totaling 49 million for five cost method investments that were liquidated we also repurchased a portion of our convertible senior notes and recorded a loss for the early extinguishment of debt see note 3 to our consolidated financial statements for an additional description of this loss 

 

the decrease in interest income during fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 was due to lower average cash balances and lower interest rates 

 

we determined that certain of our nonmarketable securities were otherthantemporarily impaired and we wrote down the investments by 15 million during fiscal 2010 52 million during fiscal 2009 and 86 million during fiscal 2008 during fiscal 2008 we determined that two of our availableforsale securities were otherthantemporarily impaired based on the severity and the duration of the impairments and we wrote down the investments by 81 million all of these impairments are included in the writedown of investments line in the table above 

 

during fiscal 2008 we purchased approximately 43 million shares of mentor graphics common stock in connection with our proposed acquisition of mentor graphics after the announcement of our withdrawal of the proposed acquisition of mentor graphics during fiscal 2008 we sold our entire equity interest in mentor graphics at a loss of 94 million which is included in the gains losses on availableforsale securities line in the table above 

 

the 93 million loss on liquidation of subsidiary is primarily attributable to currency translation adjustment losses net of gains previously recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income on our consolidated balance sheet for a subsidiary that was completely liquidated during fiscal 2008 

provision benefit for income taxes 

 

the provision benefit for income taxes and the effective tax rates during fiscal 2010 fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008 were as follows 

 

 

 

our fiscal 2010 benefit for income taxes is primarily because of the decrease in net unrecognized tax benefits and accrued interest of 1479 million as a result of our effective settlement of certain tax matters with the irs in august 2010 and the release of 667 million of valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets primarily due to the recognition of deferred tax liabilities related to the acquisition of intangibles with denali in june 2010 our fiscal 2010 benefit for income taxes included 46 million of tax expense for uncertain tax positions that should have been recognized during fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2009 the effect of this tax expense on our consolidated financial statements for fiscal 2010 and on our consolidated financial statements for fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2009 is not considered material 

 

during fiscal 2009 a change in united states federal tax law allowed companies to elect to carry back the fiscal 2009 net operating loss for a period of three four or five years instead of the general twoyear carryback period our benefit for income taxes during fiscal 2009 is primarily due to 273 million of tax benefit from the fiscal 2009 united states federal net operating losses that can be utilized to offset taxable income in prior years that is partially offset by current year interest expense related to unrecognized tax benefits of 133 million and an increase in unrecognized tax benefits penalties and interest related to prior year tax positions of 145 million with the exception of the fiscal 2009 united states federal net operating loss that can be utilized in prior years we recorded a valuation allowance that offset the tax benefit from other fiscal 2009 united states losses and tax credits the 145 million increase in unrecognized tax benefits penalties and interest during fiscal 2009 included 73 million of unrecognized tax benefits penalties and interest that should have been recognized during multiple periods between fiscal 2004 through fiscal 2008 the effects on our fiscal 2009 results and our consolidated financial statements for prior periods are not considered material 

 

we had a fiscal 2008 provision for income taxes primarily due to the significant fiscal 2008 tax expenses related to the impairment of nondeductible goodwill the increase in our valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets and our decision to repatriate previously untaxed foreign earnings during fiscal 2008 we recognized the impairment of 10597 million of united states goodwill that was nondeductible we also increased the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets by 3260 million because of the uncertainty regarding their ultimate realization in making this judgment we considered the fiscal 2008 loss that resulted in a cumulative threeyear loss and other factors finally given the challenges in the global capital markets during fiscal 2008 we decided that 3172 million of previously untaxed earnings from foreign subsidiaries would not be indefinitely reinvested outside of the united states as a result we accrued a tax expense of 1011 million during fiscal 2008 to provide for the federal state and foreign income taxes on these repatriations our effective tax rate was negative for fiscal 2008 primarily due to the fiscal 2008 loss before provision for income taxes and the fiscal 2008 tax expenses related to the impairment of nondeductible goodwill the increase in our valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets and our decision to repatriate previously untaxed foreign earnings 

 

we expect to have a provision for income taxes for fiscal 2011 primarily due to tax expense of certain foreign subsidiaries and interest expense on our unrecognized tax benefits in addition we currently anticipate recording a valuation allowance that will offset the potential tax benefit of certain united states tax credit carryforwards generated during fiscal 2011 our expectation excludes the impact of possible effective settlements of tax examinations that may occur during fiscal 2011 we also expect that our estimated annual effective tax rate to be particularly sensitive to any changes to our estimates of tax expense because we expect fiscal 2011 income to be near breakeven 

we intend to indefinitely reinvest approximately 1330 million of undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries as of january 1 2011 to meet the working capital and longterm capital needs of our foreign subsidiaries the unrecognized deferred tax liability for these indefinitely reinvested foreign earnings was approximately 610 million as of january 1 2011 

 

we regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized we concluded that a valuation allowance of 3747 million was required as of january 1 2011 this represents a decrease in valuation allowance of 84 million in comparison with the year ended january 2 2010 if in the future we determine that these deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized a release of all or part of the related valuation allowance could result in a material income tax benefit in the period such determination is made 

 

the irs and other tax authorities regularly examine our income tax returns and we have received rars indicating that the irs has proposed to assess certain tax deficiencies for further discussion regarding our income taxes including the calculation of our valuation allowance our deferred tax assets and the status of the irs examinations see note 6 to our consolidated financial statements 

 

liquidity and capital resources 

 

 

 

 

 

cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments 

 

as of january 1 2011 our principal sources of liquidity consisted of 5701 million of cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments as compared to 5713 million as of january 2 2010 and 5721 million as of january 3 2009 approximately onethird of our cash and cash equivalents is held in accounts in the united states 

 

our primary sources of cash during fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009 were 

 

 50 

 

our primary uses of cash during fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009 were 

 

  

we expect that current cash and shortterm investment balances and cash flows that are generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital other capital and liquidity requirements for at least the next 12 months 

 

net working capital 

 

net working capital decreased 2709 million as of january 1 2011 as compared to january 2 2010 and increased 630 million as of january 2 2010 as compared to january 3 2009 due to the following 

 

 

 

because our 2011 notes mature on december 15 2011 our consolidated balance sheet as of january 1 2011 includes a current liability of 1433 million representing the 1500 million principal amount of the 2011 notes net of the applicable discount discount amortization will continue during fiscal 2011 and the carrying value of the 2011 notes will equal the 1500 million principal amount at maturity 

 

prior to the maturity of the 2015 notes holders of the 2015 notes have the right to surrender their notes for conversion into cash during any fiscal quarter and only during such fiscal quarter if the last reported sale price of our common stock exceeds 981 for 20 or more trading days in a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding fiscal quarter if the notes were to become convertible even if holders do not convert their notes the principal balance of the 2015 notes net of the associated discount would be reported as a current liability on our consolidated balance sheet reporting our 2015 notes as a current liability could have a material adverse impact on our net working capital 

 

in connection with the 2015 notes we entered into convertible note hedge transactions with various financial institutions these convertible note hedge transactions are expected generally to reduce our exposure under the 2015 notes in the event of cash conversion of the 2015 notes 

 

for an additional description of our 2011 notes and 2015 notes see “other factors affecting liquidity and capital resources” and note 3 to our consolidated financial statements 

cash flows from operating activities 

 

net cash provided by operating activities increased 1735 million during fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 and decreased 447 million during fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 due to the following 

 

 

 

cash flows from operating activities include net income loss adjusted for certain noncash charges as well as changes in the balances of certain assets and liabilities our cash flows from operating activities are significantly influenced by business levels and the payment terms set forth in our license agreements during fiscal 2009 our customers who are primarily concentrated in the semiconductor sector experienced adverse changes in their business due to the challenging economic environment while the semiconductor industry grew and overall economic conditions stabilized during fiscal 2010 our customers may experience adverse changes in the future that may cause them to delay purchasing our products and services or delay or default on their payment obligations 

 

as of january 1 2011 one customer accounted for 19 of our total receivables net and installment contract receivables net as of january 2 2010 one customer accounted for 15 of our receivables net and installment contract receivables net as of january 1 2011 and january 2 2010 approximately half of our total receivables net and installment contract receivables net were attributable to ten of our customers if our customers are not successful in generating sufficient cash or are precluded from securing financing they may not be able to pay or may delay payment of accounts receivable that are owed to us although these obligations are generally not cancelable our customers’ inability to fulfill payment obligations may adversely affect our cash flow additionally our customers may seek to renegotiate preexisting contractual commitments though we have not yet experienced a material level of defaults any material payment default by our customers or significant reductions in existing contractual commitments would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and cash flows from operations 

 

we have entered into agreements whereby we may transfer accounts receivable to certain financial institutions on a nonrecourse or limitedrecourse basis during fiscal 2009 we transferred accounts receivable to financial institutions on a nonrecourse basis totaling 58 million net of the losses on the sale of the receivables as compared to 522 million during fiscal 2008 during fiscal 2010 we did not transfer any of our accounts receivable to financial institutions the change in our license mix has resulted in an increased number of subscription licenses and therefore a decrease in the sale of receivables to financial institutions for an additional description of our sales of receivables see note 17 to our consolidated financial statements 

 

we expect to pay 158 million in cash related to the settlement of our shareholder and derivative litigation which is total settlement costs of 400 million net of 242 million we expect will be paid by our insurance carriers see note 15 to our consolidated financial statements for an additional description of our legal proceedings and this settlement 

 

during fiscal 2008 and 2009 we initiated restructuring plans to decrease costs by reducing our workforce and by consolidating facilities in february 2011 we announced additional restructuring activities that we initiated during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 to decrease costs by reducing our workforce and by consolidating facilities we expect that substantially all of the estimated restructuring planrelated annual operating expense savings related to the 2010 restructuring activities will be offset by increased spending in connection with developing and enhancing our product technologies 

as of january 1 2011 we have paid of 745 million in connection with the restructuring plans initiated in 2008 and 2009 we expect to pay an additional 111 million related to the 2008 2009 and 2010 restructuring activities of which 91 million is for termination benefits related to the 2010 restructuring activities we expect substantially all termination benefits related to the 2010 restructuring plan to be paid by the end of fiscal 2011 

 

we expect that cash flows from operating activities will fluctuate in future periods due to a number of factors including the timing of our billings and collections the timing and amount of tax payments and our operating results 

 

cash flows from investing activities 

 

our primary investing activities during fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009 consisted of 

 

  

net cash used for investing activities decreased 2346 million during fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 and decreased 764 million during fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 due to the following 

 

 

 

during fiscal 2010 we acquired denali for an aggregate initial purchase price of 2968 million which was paid in cash for an additional description of our acquisition of denali see note 4 to our consolidated financial statements 

 

in connection with our acquisitions completed before january 1 2011 we may be obligated to pay up to an aggregate of 179 million during the next 27 months if certain defined performance goals are achieved in full of which 102 million would be expensed in our consolidated statements of operations 

 

during fiscal 2008 we purchased approximately 43 million shares of mentor graphics common stock for 624 million in connection with our proposed acquisition of mentor graphics after the announcement of our withdrawal of the proposed acquisition of mentor graphics we sold our entire equity interest in mentor graphics for 530 million 

 

in january 2007 we completed the sale of certain land and buildings in san jose california for a sales price of 465 million in cash concurrently with the sale we leased back from the purchaser all available space in the buildings during the lease term we constructed an additional building on our san jose california campus to replace the buildings we sold in this transaction the decrease in cash payments for property plant and equipment during fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 is primarily due to the completion of this new building in january 2009 

 

we expect to continue our investing activities including purchasing property plant and equipment purchasing intangible assets purchasing software licenses business combinations and making longterm equity investments 

cash flows from financing activities 

 

during fiscal 2010 we issued 3500 million principal amount of the 2015 notes concurrently with the issuance of the 2015 notes we entered into the 2015 notes hedges with various parties to reduce the potential cash outlay from the conversion of the 2015 notes and to mitigate the negative effect such conversion may have on the price of our common stock in separate transactions we sold warrants or the 2015 warrants to purchase our common stock at a price of 1078 per share to various parties we used an aggregate of 1872 million of the net proceeds from the issuance of the 2015 notes to purchase in the open market 1000 million principal amount of our 2011 notes and 1000 million principal amount of our 2013 notes and we repurchased approximately 65 million shares of our common stock at a cost of 400 million 

 

during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 in a separate transaction we repurchased in the open market 55 million principal amount of our 2013 notes 

 

net cash provided by financing activities increased by 389 million during fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 net cash provided by financing activities during fiscal 2009 was 210 million as compared to net cash used for financing activities of 4434 million during fiscal 2008 the changes in our financing cash flows are due to the following 

 

 

 

during fiscal 2010 we paid 97 million of taxes related to employee stock transactions see note 6 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of this payment 

 

the decrease in proceeds from the issuance of common stock during fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 and during fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 is primarily due to decreased purchase limits under our espp which became effective during fiscal 2009 

 

when treasury stock is reissued at a price higher than its cost the difference is recorded as a component of capital in excess of par in the consolidated balance sheets when treasury stock is reissued at a price lower than its cost the difference is recorded as a component of capital in excess of par to the extent that there are treasury stock gains to offset the losses if there are no treasury stock gains in capital in excess of par the losses upon reissuance of treasury stock are recorded as a component of accumulated deficit in the consolidated balance sheets we recorded losses on the reissuance of treasury stock of 874 million during fiscal 2010 2134 million during fiscal 2009 and 1106 million during fiscal 2008 

 

as of january 1 2011 we have 8144 million remaining under the stock repurchase programs authorized by our board of directors see note 12 to our consolidated financial statements 

 

the 1500 million principal amount of our 2011 notes is due on december 15 2011 

other factors affecting liquidity and capital resources 

 

income taxes 

 

we provide for united states income taxes on earnings of our foreign subsidiaries unless the earnings are considered indefinitely invested outside the united states during fiscal 2010 we repatriated 634 million of previously taxed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries resulting in cash tax payments of approximately 19 million as of january 1 2011 we had a deferred tax liability of 52 million related to 86 million of earnings from certain foreign subsidiaries that are not considered indefinitely reinvested outside the united states and for which we have previously made a provision for income tax 

 

we intend to indefinitely reinvest approximately 1330 million of undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries as of january 1 2011 to meet the working capital and longterm capital needs of our foreign subsidiaries the unrecognized deferred tax liability for these indefinitely reinvested foreign earnings was approximately 610 million as of january 1 2011 

 

the irs and other tax authorities regularly examine our income tax returns and we have received rars pursuant to which the irs has proposed to assess certain tax deficiencies for an additional description of our irs examinations see note 6 to our consolidated financial statements 

 

during fiscal 2010 we determined that uncertain tax positions that were subject to the irs examination of our federal income tax returns for the tax years 2000 through 2002 were effectively settled in prior fiscal periods we made cash deposits of approximately 89 million to the irs related to this settlement during fiscal 2010 net of tax refunds we expect to receive we made additional cash payments of approximately 09 million to the irs and to various state and local tax authorities to cover our remaining tax liabilities related to this settlement 

 

during fiscal 2010 we released 667 million of valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets due to the acquisition accounting for denali this release of the valuation allowance is primarily related to deferred income tax liabilities for acquired intangible assets and does not impact our current or future cash position 

 

as of january 1 2011 we had current income tax liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits of 58 million as of january 1 2011 we had longterm income tax liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits of 766 million for an additional description of the income tax liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits see the discussion under the heading “contractual obligations” 

 

2625 cash convertible senior notes due 2015 

 

in june 2010 we issued 3500 million principal amount of our 2015 notes to four initial purchasers in a private placement pursuant to section 42 of the securities act of 1933 as amended or the securities act for resale to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to rule 144a of the securities act concurrently with the issuance of the 2015 notes we entered into the 2015 notes hedges with various parties to reduce the potential cash outlay from the cash conversion of the 2015 notes and to mitigate the negative effect such cash conversion may have on the price of our common stock in separate transactions we sold the 2015 warrants to various parties the 2015 notes mature on june 1 2015 and will be paid in cash at maturity as of january 1 2011 none of the conditions allowing the holders of the 2015 notes to convert had been met however the price of our common stock has recently been near or greater than the stock price necessary to allow holders of the 2015 notes to convert if this stock price condition is met in accordance with the terms of the 2015 notes then upon any conversion of the 2015 notes by holders we would be required to pay a settlement amount determined in accordance with the terms of the 2015 notes in that event the 2015 notes hedges counterparties would generally be required to pay to us an amount equal to the cash conversion value of the 2015 notes that have been converted to the extent that the cash conversion value exceeds the par amount of the converted 2015 notes for an additional description of the 2015 notes including the hedge and warrants transactions see note 3 to our consolidated financial statements 

 

1375 convertible senior notes due december 15 2011 and 1500 convertible senior notes due december 15 2013 

 

in december 2006 we issued 2500 million principal amount of our 2011 notes and 2500 million of our 2013 notes to three initial purchasers in a private placement pursuant to section 42 of the securities act for resale 

to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to rule 144a of the securities act concurrently with the issuance of the convertible senior notes we entered into the convertible senior notes hedges with various parties to reduce the potential dilution from the conversion of the convertible senior notes and to mitigate the negative effect such conversion may have on the price of our common stock in separate transactions we sold the convertible senior notes warrants to various parties the 2011 notes mature on december 15 2011 and the 2013 notes mature on december 15 2013 and the principal amounts will be paid in cash at maturity as of january 1 2011 none of the conditions allowing the holders of the convertible senior notes to convert had been met because the 2011 notes mature on december 15 2011 our consolidated balance sheet as of january 1 2011 includes a current liability of 1433 million representing the 1500 million principal amount of the 2011 notes net of the applicable discount discount amortization will continue during fiscal 2011 and the carrying value of the 2011 notes will equal the 1500 million principal amount at maturity 

 

in connection with the issuance of the 2015 notes we used an aggregate of 1872 million of the net proceeds to purchase in the open market 1000 million principal amount of our 2011 notes and 1000 million principal amount of our 2013 notes resulting in a remaining principal balance of 1500 million for the 2011 notes and 1500 million for the 2013 notes during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 in a separate transaction we repurchased in the open market 55 million principal amount of our 2013 notes which resulted in a remaining principal balance for the 2013 notes of 1445 million we also sold a portion of the convertible senior notes hedges and purchased a portion of the convertible senior notes warrants at the time of these repurchases for an additional description of the convertible senior notes including the hedge and warrants transactions see note 3 to our consolidated financial statements 

 

contractual obligations 

 

a summary of our contractual obligations as of january 1 2011 is as follows 

 

 

 

 

 

 56 

  

  

with respect to purchase obligations that are cancelable by us the table includes the amount that would have been payable if we had canceled the obligation as of january 1 2011 or the earliest cancellation date 

 

in connection with our acquisitions completed before january 1 2011 we may be obligated to pay up to an aggregate of 179 million in cash during the next 27 months if certain defined performance goals are achieved in full 

 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

 

as of january 1 2011 we did not have any significant offbalance sheet arrangements as defined in item 303a4ii of sec regulation sk 

 

new accounting standards 

 

in october 2009 the fasb issued new accounting standards for multipledeliverable arrangements and for revenue arrangements that include both tangible products and software elements 

 

the new standards for multipledeliverable arrangements enable vendors to account for products or services deliverables separately rather than as a combined unit these standards establish a selling price hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable based on a vendorspecific objective evidence b thirdparty evidence or c estimates these standards also eliminate the residual method of allocation and require that arrangement consideration be allocated at the inception of the arrangement to all deliverables using the relative selling price method in addition these standards significantly expand required disclosures related to a vendor’s multipledeliverable revenue arrangements 

 

under the new standards for revenue arrangements that include both tangible products and software elements tangible products containing software components and nonsoftware components that function together to deliver the tangible product’s essential functionality are excluded from the preexisting software revenue standards in addition hardware components of a tangible product containing software components are always excluded from the preexisting software revenue standards 

 

we have adopted these standards prospectively as of january 2 2011 the first day of fiscal 2011 for multiple element arrangements involving our emulation hardware systems and for other nonsoftware related deliverables the impact of these new standards will result in revenue being recognized for certain sales of hardware and nonsoftware deliverables that are separate from the software deliverables within a multiple element arrangement which may result in the value of upfront revenue orders exceeding 10 of the total value of all orders in a single fiscal quarter the nature and magnitude of the specific effects will depend on the arrangements we enter into with multiple deliverables after the adoption date but we do not expect the application of these new standards will impact our intended mix of orders for fiscal 2011 as outlined under the heading “results of operations — revenue” 

 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

 

foreign currency risk 

 

most of our revenue expenses and material business activity are transacted in the united states dollar however certain of our operations include transactions in foreign currencies and therefore we benefit from a weaker dollar and in certain countries in particular japan where we invoice customers in the local currency we are adversely affected by a stronger dollar the primary effect of foreign currency transactions on our results of operations from a weakening united states dollar is an increase in revenue offset by a smaller increase in expenses conversely the primary effect of foreign currency transactions on our results of operations from a strengthening united states dollar is a reduction in revenue offset by a smaller reduction in expenses 

 

we enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts with financial institutions to protect against currency exchange risks associated with existing assets and liabilities a foreign currency forward exchange contract acts as a hedge by increasing in value when underlying assets decrease in value or underlying liabilities increase in value due to changes in foreign exchange rates conversely a foreign currency forward exchange contract decreases in value when underlying assets increase in value or underlying liabilities decrease in value due to changes in foreign exchange rates these forward contracts are not designated as accounting hedges and therefore the unrealized gains and losses are recognized in other income expense net in advance of the actual foreign currency cash flows with the fair value of these forward contracts being recorded as accrued liabilities or other current assets 

 

our policy governing hedges of foreign currency risk does not allow us to use forward contracts for trading purposes our forward contracts generally have maturities of 90 days or less the effectiveness of our hedging program depends on our ability to estimate future asset and liability exposures we enter into currency forward exchange contracts based on estimated future asset and liability exposures recognized gains and losses with respect to our current hedging activities will ultimately depend on how accurately we are able to match the amount of currency forward exchange contracts with actual underlying asset and liability exposures 

 

the following table provides information as of january 1 2011 about our forward foreign currency contracts the information is provided in united states dollar equivalent amounts the table presents the notional amounts at contract exchange rates and the weighted average contractual foreign currency exchange rates expressed as units of the foreign currency per united states dollar which in some cases may not be the market convention for quoting a particular currency all of these forward contracts mature before or during march 2011 

 

 

while we actively monitor our foreign currency risks there can be no assurance that our foreign currency hedging activities will substantially offset the impact of fluctuations in currency exchange rates on our results of operations cash flows and financial position 

 

interest rate risk 

 

our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our portfolio of cash and cash equivalents while we are exposed to interest rate fluctuations in many of the world’s leading industrialized countries our interest income and expense is most sensitive to fluctuations in the general level of united states interest rates in this regard changes in united states interest rates affect the interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents and the costs associated with foreign currency hedges 

 

we invest in high quality credit issuers and by policy limit the amount of our credit exposure to any one issuer as part of our policy our first priority is to reduce the risk of principal loss consequently we seek to preserve our invested funds by limiting default risk market risk and reinvestment risk we mitigate default risk by investing in only high quality credit securities that we believe to have low credit risk and by positioning our portfolio to respond appropriately to a significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor the shortterm interestbearing portfolio of cash and cash equivalents includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity 

 

all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase are considered to be cash equivalents investments with maturities greater than three months are classified as availableforsale and are considered to be shortterm investments the carrying value of our interestbearing instruments approximated fair value as of january 1 2011 the following table presents the carrying value and related weighted average interest rates for our interestbearing instruments which are all classified as cash and cash equivalents on our consolidated balance sheet as of january 1 2011 

 

 

 

equity price risk 

 

2625 cash convertible senior notes due 2015 

 

in june 2010 we issued 3500 million principal amount of our 2015 notes in a separate private placement transaction we also sold warrants to various parties for the purchase of up to approximately 464 million shares of cadence’s common stock at a price of 1078 per share these warrants expire on various dates from september 2015 through december 2015 and must be settled in net shares for an additional description of our 2015 notes see “liquidity and capital resources other factors affecting liquidity and capital resources” and note 3 to our consolidated financial statements 

 

1375 convertible senior notes due december 15 2011 and 1500 convertible senior notes due december 15 2013 

 

in december 2006 we issued 2500 million principal amount of our 2011 notes and 2500 million of our 2013 notes for an additional description of our 2011 notes and 2013 notes see “liquidity and capital resources other factors affecting liquidity and capital resources” and note 3 to our consolidated financial statements 

 

investments 

we have a portfolio of equity investments that includes marketable equity securities and nonmarketable equity securities our equity investments are made primarily in connection with our strategic investment program under our strategic investment program from time to time we make cash investments in companies with technologies that are potentially strategically important to us see note 8 to our consolidated financial statements for an additional description of these investments 

 




 item 9 changes in and disagreements with accountants on accounting and financial disclosure

 item 9a controls and procedures 

 

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

 

we carried out an evaluation required by rule 13a15 of the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended or the exchange act under the supervision and with the participation of our management including our chief executive officer or ceo and our chief financial officer or cfo of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rules 1315e and 15d15e under the exchange act as of january 1 2011 

 

the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures included a review of our processes and the effect on the information generated for use in this annual report on form 10k in the course of this evaluation we sought to identify any material weaknesses in our disclosure controls and procedures to determine whether we had identified any acts of fraud involving personnel who have a significant role in our disclosure controls and procedures and to confirm that any necessary corrective action including process improvements was taken this type of evaluation is done every fiscal quarter so that our conclusions concerning the effectiveness of these controls can be reported in our periodic reports filed with the sec the overall goals of these evaluation activities are to monitor our disclosure controls and procedures and to make modifications as necessary we intend to maintain these disclosure controls and procedures modifying them as circumstances warrant 

based on their evaluation as of january 1 2011 our ceo and cfo have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by us in our reports filed or submitted under the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the sec’s rules and forms and is accumulated and communicated to our management including the ceo and cfo as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure 

 

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

 

there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended january 1 2011 that materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting 

 

inherent limitations on effectiveness of controls 

 

our management including our ceo and cfo does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all error and all fraud internal control over financial reporting no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of internal control are met further the design of internal control must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of the control must be considered relative to their costs while our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance of their effectiveness because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within cadence have been detected 

 

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rule 13a15f under the exchange act our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of january 1 2011 in making this assessment our management used the criteria established in internal controlintegrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission our management has concluded that as of january 1 2011 our internal control over financial reporting is effective based on these criteria our independent registered public accounting firm kpmg llp has issued an attestation report on our internal control over financial reporting which is included in item 15 “exhibits and financial statement schedules”

we develop electronic design automation or eda software and hardware we license software sell or lease hardware technology and provide engineering and education services throughout the world to help manage and accelerate electronics product development processes our customers use our products and services to design and develop complex integrated circuits or ics and electronics systems 

 

we were organized as a delaware corporation in june 1988 our headquarters is located at 2655 seely avenue san jose california 95134 our telephone number is 408 9431234 we use our website at wwwcadencecom as a channel for distribution of important information about our company news releases and financial information regarding our company are posted on and accessible at our investor relations webpage on our website at wwwcadencecom  our website permits investors to subscribe to email notification alerts when we post new material information on our website we also make available on our investor relations webpage free of charge copies of our sec filings and submissions as soon as reasonably practicable after electronically filing or furnishing such documents with the sec our corporate governance guidelines code of business conduct and the charters of the audit committee compensation committee and corporate governance and nominating committee of our board of directors are also posted on the investor relations webpage on our website at wwwcadencecom  stockholders may also request copies of these documents by writing to our corporate secretary at the address above information on our website is not incorporated by reference in this annual report on form 10k unless expressly noted 

 

factors driving the electronic design automation industry 

 

during 2008 and 2009 the semiconductor industry’s growth declined as the overall macroeconomic environment deteriorated electronics companies faced financial challenges in 2008 and 2009 because consumer spending on electronics was adversely affected by increased unemployment and corporate spending was restrained by the tightened credit market and the economic downturn during 2009 semiconductor unit volumes decreased and average selling prices declined these factors combined with the macroeconomic environment affect how electronics companies address traditional challenges of cost quality innovation and timetomarket associated with highly complex electronics systems and ic product development 

although estimates project moderate growth for the semiconductor industry in 2010 we believe that increased spending on eda and other tools may grow more slowly than the semiconductor industry as a whole in 2010 

 

electronics companies demand ever higher levels of productivity from their design teams better predictability in their development schedules and higher quality products in order to be competitive and profitable in the priceconscious markets they serve electronics companies are responding to demand for increased functionality and miniaturization by combining subsystems — such as radio frequency or rf wireless communication video signal processing and microprocessors — onto a single silicon chip creating a systemonchip or soc or multiple chips into a single chip package in a format referred to as systeminpackage or sip these trends toward subsystem integration have required chip makers to find solutions to challenges previously addressed by system companies such as verifying systemlevel functionality and hardwaresoftware interoperability 

 

soc designs put many more transistors on each chip increasing the need for tight control over power consumption this is done not only to increase battery life in portable devices but also to minimize energy cost for computing and networking equipment higher power devices generate more heat which further increases both system cost as well as operating expenses for cooling evolving semiconductor manufacturing processes with smaller features transistors and wires and lower supply voltages address both of these issues to some degree but introduce new challenges of their own contemporary portable electronic devices contain chips in which individual features can be as small as 45 nanometers or 451000000ths of a millimeter because of the electrical characteristics of the materials used to construct the transistors which are essentially microscopic switches chips continue to consume power even when transistors in the device are switched off to overcome these and other powerrelated issues specific “low power” design techniques must be developed and are most effective if they are integrated throughout the design flow from logic design and verification through physical implementation 

 

variability in the processes and materials used to manufacture silicon chips have become so pervasive at 65 nanometers and below that traditional connections between design and manufacturing teams are insufficient to ensure chip performance and yield integrating detailed models of the manufacturing process into the chip design environment is desirable so engineers can craft a design to avoid or overcome these manufacturing process variations similarly manufacturing teams can optimize their processes if along with the design they are provided with information about the most critical parts of the chip however sharing information between design and manufacturing processes is complicated because current data formats used to describe the chip design differ from data formats used to describe the manufacturing process and control the manufacturing equipment moreover design and manufacturing most often involve two or more separate companies because multiple companies may participate in the design of the chip and in the manufacturing and assembly of the final device 

 

these trends represent significant new challenges for electronics design processes specifically product performance and size requirements of the mobile consumer electronics market require microelectronic systems to be smaller consume less power and provide multiple functions all in one soc or sip this requires designers to pay close attention to many electrical physical and manufacturing effects that were inconsequential in previous generations of chip designs the design challenge becomes more complex with each new generation of electronics and providers of eda solutions must deliver products that address these technical challenges while improving the productivity predictability reliability and profitability of the design process

marketing and sales 

 

we generally market our products and provide maintenance and services to existing and prospective customers through a direct sales force consisting of sales people and applications engineers applications engineers provide technical presales and postsales support for software products due to the complexity of many of our eda products and the electronic design process the sales cycle is generally long requiring three to six months or more during the sales cycle our direct sales force generally provides technical presentations product demonstrations and support for onsite customer evaluation of our solutions we also use traditional marketing approaches to promote our products and services including advertising direct mail trade shows public relations and the internet we selectively utilize value added resellers to broaden our reach and reduce cost of sales all orcad and selected incisive products are primarily marketed through these channels with respect to international sales we generally market and support our products and services through our subsidiaries we also use a thirdparty distributor to sell our products and services to certain customers in japan 

 

software licensing arrangements 

 

we sell software using three license types subscription term and perpetual customers who prefer to license technology for a specified limited period of time will choose either a subscription or term license and customers who prefer to have the right to use the technology continuously without time restriction will choose a perpetual license customers who desire to use new technology during the life of the contract will select a subscription license which allows them limited access to unspecified new technology on a whenandifavailable basis as opposed to a term or perpetual license which does not include rights to use new technology payment terms for subscription and term licenses generally provide for payments to be made in installments over the license period and payment terms for perpetual licenses generally are net 30 days 

 

we offer a delivery mechanism for term and subscription licenses called eda cards eda cards have an overall “face” value amount that customers draw down against as they select specific products that are priced based on the particular duration of use the customer desires the selection and licensing of the specific products is accomplished through an automated online system the card expires when all of the face value is consumed or on the predetermined expiration date whichever comes first there are two types of eda cards an eda gold card is a term license that enables a customer to access a predetermined list of existing products an eda platinum card is a subscription license that enables a customer to access existing and new technology 

 

for a further description of our license agreements revenue recognition policies and results of operations please refer to the discussion under the heading “critical accounting estimates” under item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” 

 

backlog 

 

our backlog as of january 2 2010 was approximately 16 billion as compared to approximately 18 billion as of january 3 2009 backlog consists of revenue to be recognized in fiscal periods after january 2 2010 from a variety of license types which generally include but are not limited to 

 

  

the substantial majority of our backlog is generated by our product and maintenance businesses because customer licenses generally include both product and maintenance components historically we have not experienced significant cancellations of our contracts with customers however we occasionally reschedule the required completion dates of engineering services contracts deferring revenue recognition under those contracts beyond the original anticipated completion date changes in customer license types or payment terms also can 

impact the timing of revenue recognition we currently expect approximately 80 of our fiscal 2010 revenue to come from our backlog as of january 2 2010 

 

revenue seasonality 

 

historically revenue has been lowest in our first quarter and highest in our fourth quarter with a material decline between the fourth quarter of one year and the first quarter of the following year however our license mix has changed such that a substantial proportion of licenses require ratable revenue recognition although we still expect the first quarter to remain our lowest quarter for revenue within a fiscal year we do not expect the decrease in revenue from the fourth quarter of one year to the first quarter of the following year to be as significant as it has been historically 

 

research and development 

 

our investment in research and development was 3547 million during fiscal 2009 4579 million during fiscal 2008 and 4940 million during fiscal 2007 

 

the primary areas of our research and development include soc design the design of silicon devices in the nanometer range highperformance ic packaging sip and pcb design systemlevel modeling and verification highperformance logic verification technology and hardwaresoftware coverification the electronics industry combines rapid innovation with rapidly increasing design and manufacturing complexity so we make significant investments in enhancing our current products as well as creating new products and technologies and integrating those products and technologies together into segmented solutions 

 

our future performance depends largely on our ability to maintain and enhance our current product development and commercialization to develop acquire or operate with new products from third parties and to develop solutions that meet increasingly demanding productivity quality predictability and cost requirements on a schedule that keeps pace with our customers’ technical developments and industry standards 

 

manufacturing and software distribution 

 

we perform final assembly and testing of our hardware verification acceleration and emulation products at our headquarters in san jose california subcontractors manufacture all major subassemblies including all individual pcbs and custom ics and supply them for qualification and testing before their incorporation into the assembled product 

 

software and documentation are primarily distributed to customers by secure electronic delivery or on dvd 

 

proprietary technology 

 

our success depends in part upon our proprietary technology we generally rely on patents copyrights trademarks and trade secret laws licenses and restrictive agreements to establish and protect our proprietary rights in technology and products many of our products include software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties we may have to seek new licenses or renew existing licenses for third party software and other intellectual property in the future as part of performing engineering services for customers our engineering services business uses certain software and other intellectual property licensed from third parties including that of our competitors 

 

competition 

 

we compete in the eda industry for products and maintenance primarily with three companies synopsys inc mentor graphics corporation and magma design automation inc we also compete with numerous smaller eda companies with manufacturers of electronic devices that have developed or have the capability to develop their own eda products and with numerous electronics design and consulting companies we generally compete on the basis of product quality product features level of integration or compatibility with other tools price payment terms and maintenance offerings 

our maintenance business flows directly from our product business the competitive issues associated with our maintenance business are substantially similar to those for our product business in that every maintenance contract is the direct result of a product contract and once we have entered into a product contract maintenance is generally purchased by the customer to ensure access to bug fixes and service releases as and when they are made available and other continued support 

 

certain competitive factors in the engineering services business as described herein differ from those of the products and maintenance businesses while we do compete with other eda companies in the engineering services business our principal competitors are independent engineering service businesses these companies vary greatly in focus geographic location capability cost structure and pricing in addition manufacturers of electronic devices may be reluctant to purchase services from independent vendors including us because they wish to promote their own internal design departments we compete with these companies by focusing on the design of complex analog digital and mixedsignal ics and socs it is our strategy to use engineering services as a differentiator to further promote our products and maintenance businesses 

 

international operations 

 

we have 56 sales offices design centers and research and development facilities approximately half of which are located outside of the united states we consider customer sales and support requirements the availability of a skilled workforce and costs and efficiencies among other relative benefits when determining what operations to locate internationally for additional information regarding our international operations see the discussion under the heading “the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations and other risks to our international operations may seriously harm our financial condition” under item 1a “risk factors” and note 21 to our consolidated financial statements 

 

employees 

 

as of january 2 2010 we employed approximately 4400 individuals with approximately 1800 in sales services marketing support and manufacturing activities approximately 2000 in product research and development and approximately 600 in management administration and finance none of our employees is represented by a labor union and we have experienced no work stoppages we believe that our employee relations are good

 item 1a risk factors 

 

our business faces many risks described below are what we believe to be the material risks that we face if any of the events or circumstances described in the following risks actually occurs our business financial condition or results of operations could suffer 

 

risks related to our business 

 

we are subject to the cyclical nature of the integrated circuit and electronics systems industries and any downturn in these industries may reduce our orders and revenue 

 

purchases of our products and services are dependent upon the commencement of new design projects by ic manufacturers and electronics systems companies the ic and electronics systems industries are cyclical and are characterized by constant and rapid technological change rapid product obsolescence and price erosion evolving standards short product life cycles and wide fluctuations in product supply and demand 

 

the ic and electronics systems industries experienced significant challenges in 2008 and 2009 the ic and electronic systems industries have also experienced significant downturns in connection with or in anticipation of maturing product cycles of both these industries’ and their customers’ products as in the past the economic downturn in 2008 and 2009 was characterized by diminished product demand production overcapacity high inventory levels and accelerated erosion of average selling prices although estimates project moderate growth for the semiconductor industry in 2010 we believe that increased spending on eda and other tools may grow more slowly than the semiconductor industry as a whole in 2010 the economic downturn in the industries we serve has contributed to the reduction in our revenue in the past and could continue to adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition 

 

we have experienced varied operating results and our operating results for any particular fiscal period are affected by the timing of significant orders for our software products fluctuations in customer preferences for license types and the timing of revenue recognition under those license types 

 

we have experienced and may continue to experience varied operating results in particular we incurred net losses during fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008 and we expect to incur a net loss during fiscal 2010 various factors affect our operating results and some of them are not within our control our operating results for any period are affected by the timing of certain orders for our software products 

 

our operating results are also affected by the mix of license types executed in any given period we license software using three different license types subscription term and perpetual product revenue associated with term and perpetual licenses is generally recognized at the beginning of the license period whereas product revenue associated with subscription licenses is recognized over multiple periods during the term of the license revenue may also be deferred under term and perpetual licenses until payments become due and payable from customers with nonlinear payment terms or as cash is collected from customers with lower credit ratings in addition revenue is impacted by the timing of license renewals the extent to which contracts contain flexible payment terms changes in existing contractual arrangements with customers and the mix of license types ie perpetual term or subscription for existing customers these changes could have the effect of accelerating or delaying the recognition of revenue from the timing of recognition under the original contract our license mix has changed such that a substantial proportion of licenses require ratable revenue recognition and we expect the change in license mix combined with the slow growth in spending by our customers in the semiconductor sector may make it difficult for us to increase our revenue 

 

we plan operating expense levels primarily based on forecasted revenue levels these expenses and the impact of longterm commitments are relatively fixed in the short term in addition revenue levels are harder to forecast in a difficult economic environment a shortfall in revenue could lead to operating results below expectations because we may not be able to quickly reduce these expenses in response to shortterm business changes 

 

generally the majority of our contracts are executed in the final few weeks of a fiscal quarter this makes it difficult to estimate with accuracy how much business will be executed before the end of each fiscal quarter due to 

the volume or complexity of transactions that we review at the very end of the quarter or due to operational matters regarding particular agreements we may not finish processing or ship products under some contracts that have been signed during that fiscal quarter which means that the associated revenue cannot be recognized in that particular period 

 

the methods estimates and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies have a significant impact on our results of operations see “critical accounting estimates” under item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” such methods estimates and judgments are by their nature subject to substantial risks uncertainties and assumptions and factors may arise over time that lead us to change our methods estimates and judgments changes in those methods estimates and judgments could significantly affect our results of operations 

 

you should not view our historical results of operations as reliable indicators of our future performance if our revenue operating results or business outlook for future periods fall short of the levels expected by securities analysts or investors the trading price of our common stock could decline 

 

our operating results and revenue could be adversely affected by customer payment delays customer bankruptcies and defaults or modifications of licenses or supplier modifications 

 

as a result of the challenging economic environment our customers who are primarily concentrated in the semiconductor sector have experienced and may continue to experience adverse changes in their business and as a result may delay or default on their payment obligations file for bankruptcy or modify or cancel plans to license our products and our suppliers may significantly and quickly increase their prices or reduce their output if our customers are not successful in generating sufficient cash or are precluded from securing financing they may not be able to pay or may delay payment of accounts receivable that are owed to us although these obligations are generally not cancelable our customers’ inability to fulfill payment obligations may adversely affect our revenue and cash flow additionally our customers may seek to renegotiate preexisting contractual commitments payment defaults by our customers or significant reductions in existing contractual commitments could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results because of the high volatility driving material fluctuations in asset prices the capital and credit markets have contracted and if we were to seek funding from the capital or credit markets in response to any material level of customer defaults we may not be able to secure funding on terms acceptable to us or at all which may have a material negative impact on our business 

 

our failure to respond quickly to technological developments could make our products uncompetitive and obsolete 

 

the industries in which we compete experience rapid technology developments changes in industry standards and customer requirements and frequent new product introductions and improvements currently the industries we serve are experiencing the following trends 

 

 13 

   

if we are unable to respond quickly and successfully to these trends we may lose our competitive position and our products or technologies may become uncompetitive or obsolete to compete successfully we must develop or acquire new products and improve our existing products and processes on a schedule that keeps pace with technological developments and the requirements for products addressing a broad spectrum of designers and designer expertise in our industries we must also be able to support a range of changing computer software hardware platforms and customer preferences we cannot guarantee that we will be successful in this effort 

 

our stock price has been subject to significant fluctuations and may continue to be subject to fluctuations 

 

the market price of our common stock has experienced significant fluctuations and may fluctuate or decline in the future and as a result you could lose the value of your investment the market price of our common stock may be affected by a number of factors including but not limited to 

 

  

in addition equity markets in general and technology companies’ equities in particular have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations such price and volume fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock for reasons unrelated to our business or operating results 

 

litigation could adversely affect our financial condition or operations 

 

we are currently and in the future may be involved in various disputes and litigation that arise in the ordinary course of business these include disputes and lawsuits related to intellectual property mergers and acquisitions licensing contracts distribution arrangements and employee relations matters we are also currently engaged in a consolidated securities class action lawsuit and shareholder derivative lawsuits for information regarding the litigation matters in which we are currently engaged please refer to the discussion under item 1 “legal proceedings” we cannot provide any assurances that the final outcome of these lawsuits or any other proceedings that may arise in the future will not have a material adverse effect on our business operating results financial condition or cash flows litigation can be timeconsuming and expensive and could divert management’s time and attention from our business which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and operating results 

our future revenue is dependent in part upon our installed customer base continuing to license or buy additional products renew maintenance agreements and purchase additional services 

 

our installed customer base has traditionally generated additional new license service and maintenance revenues in future periods customers may not necessarily license or buy additional products or contract for additional services or maintenance in some cases maintenance is renewable annually at a customer’s option and there are no mandatory payment obligations or obligations to license additional software if our customers decide not to renew their maintenance agreements or license additional products or contract for additional services or if they reduce the scope of the maintenance agreements our revenue could decrease which could have an adverse effect on our operating results our customers many of which are large semiconductor companies often have significant bargaining power in negotiations with us mergers or acquisitions of our customers can reduce the total level of purchases of our software and services and in some cases increase customers’ bargaining power in negotiations with their suppliers including us 

 

we depend upon our management team and key employees and our failure to attract train motivate and retain management and key employees may make us less competitive in our industries and therefore harm our results of operations 

 

our business depends upon the efforts and abilities of our executive officers and other key employees including key development personnel from time to time there may be changes in our management team resulting from the hiring and departure of executive officers and as a result we may experience disruption to our business that may harm our operating results and our relationships with our employees customers and suppliers may be adversely affected competition for highly skilled executive officers and employees can be intense particularly in geographic areas recognized as high technology centers such as the silicon valley area where our principal offices are located and the other locations where we maintain facilities to attract retain and motivate individuals with the requisite expertise we may be required to grant large numbers of stock options or other stockbased incentive awards which may be dilutive to existing stockholders and increase compensation expense and pay significant base salaries and cash bonuses which could harm our operating results the high cost of training new employees not fully utilizing these employees or losing trained employees to competing employers could also reduce our operating margins and harm our business or operating results 

 

in addition the nasdaq marketplace rules require stockholder approval for new equity compensation plans and significant amendments to existing equity compensation plans including increases in shares available for issuance under such plans and prohibit nasdaq member organizations from giving a proxy to vote on equity compensation plans unless the beneficial owner of the shares has given voting instructions these regulations could make it more difficult for us to grant equity compensation to employees in the future to the extent that these regulations make it more difficult or expensive to grant equity compensation to employees we may incur increased compensation costs or find it difficult to attract retain and motivate employees which could materially and adversely affect our business 

 

we may not be able to effectively implement our restructuring plans and our restructuring plans may not result in the expected benefits we have anticipated possibly having a negative affect on our future operating results 

 

during fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2009 we initiated restructuring plans in an effort to decrease costs by reducing our workforce and by consolidating facilities we may not be able to successfully complete and realize the expected benefits of our restructuring plans such as improvements in operating margins and cash flows in the restructuring periods contemplated the restructuring plans have involved and may continue to involve higher costs or a longer timetable than we currently anticipate or may fail to improve our operating results as we anticipate our inability to realize these benefits may result in an inefficient business structure that could negatively impact our results of operations our restructuring plans have caused us and will cause us to incur substantial costs related to severance and other employeerelated costs our restructuring plans may also subject us to litigation risks and expenses in addition our restructuring plans may have other consequences such as attrition beyond our planned reduction in workforce a negative impact on employee morale or our ability to attract highly skilled employees and our competitors may seek to gain a competitive advantage over us the restructuring plans could also cause our 

remaining employees to leave or result in reduced productivity by our employees and in turn this may affect our revenue and other operating results in the future 

 

we may not receive significant revenue from our current research and development efforts for several years if at all 

 

developing eda technology and integrating acquired technology into existing platforms is expensive and these investments often require a long time to generate returns our strategy involves significant investments in research and development and related product opportunities we believe that we must continue to dedicate a significant amount of resources to our research and development efforts to maintain and improve our competitive position however we cannot predict that we will receive significant if any revenue from these investments 

 

the competition in our industries is substantial and we may not be able to continue to successfully compete in our industries 

 

the eda industry and the commercial electronics engineering services industry are highly competitive if we fail to compete successfully in these industries it could seriously harm our business operating results or financial condition to compete in these industries we must identify and develop or acquire innovative and costcompetitive eda products integrate them into platforms and market them in a timely manner we must also gain industry acceptance for our engineering services and offer better strategic concepts technical solutions prices and response time or a combination of these factors than those of our competitors and the internal design departments of electronics manufacturers we may not be able to compete successfully in these industries factors that could affect our ability to succeed include 

 

  

we compete in the eda products market with synopsys inc magma design automation inc and mentor graphics corporation we also compete with numerous smaller eda companies with manufacturers of electronic devices that have developed or have the capability to develop their own eda products and with numerous electronics design and consulting companies manufacturers of electronic devices may be reluctant to purchase engineering services from independent vendors such as us because they wish to promote their own internal design departments 

 

we may need to change our pricing models to compete successfully 

 

the highly competitive markets in which we compete can put pressure on us to reduce the prices of our products if our competitors offer deep discounts on certain products in an effort to recapture or gain market segment share or to sell other software or hardware products we may then need to lower our prices or offer other favorable terms to compete successfully any such changes would be likely to reduce our profit margins and could adversely affect our operating results any substantial changes to our prices and pricing policies could cause sales and software license revenues to decline or be delayed as our sales force implements and our customers adjust to the new pricing policies some of our competitors may bundle products for promotional purposes or as a longterm pricing strategy or provide guarantees of prices and product implementations these practices could over time 

significantly constrain the prices that we can charge for our products if we cannot offset price reductions with a corresponding increase in the number of sales or with lower spending then the reduced license revenues resulting from lower prices could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

 

we have acquired and expect to acquire other companies and businesses and may not realize the expected benefits of these acquisitions 

 

we have acquired and expect to acquire other companies and businesses in the future while we expect to carefully analyze each potential acquisition before committing to the transaction we may not consummate any particular transaction but may nonetheless incur significant costs or if a transaction is consummated we may not be able to integrate and manage acquired products and businesses effectively in addition acquisitions involve a number of risks if any of the following events occurs when we acquire another business it could seriously harm our business operating results or financial condition 

 

  

in a number of our previously completed acquisitions we have agreed to make future payments either in the form of employee bonuses or contingent purchase price payments or earnouts based on the performance of the acquired businesses or the employees who joined us with the acquired businesses we may use earnouts for acquisitions in the future the performance goals pursuant to which these future payments may be made generally relate to achievement by the acquired business or the employees who joined us with the acquired business of certain specified orders revenue run rate product proliferation product development or employee retention goals during a specified period following completion of the applicable acquisition future acquisitions may involve issuances of stock as full or partial payment of the purchase price for the acquired business grants of incentive stock or options to employees of the acquired businesses which may be dilutive to existing stockholders expenditure of substantial cash resources or the incurrence of material amounts of debt 

 

the specific performance goal levels and amounts and timing of employee bonuses or contingent purchase price payments vary with each acquisition while we expect to derive value from an acquisition in excess of such contingent payment obligations our strategy may change and we may be required to make certain contingent payments without deriving the anticipated value 

 

we rely on our proprietary technology as well as software and other intellectual property rights licensed to us by third parties and we cannot assure you that the precautions taken to protect our rights will be adequate or that we will continue to be able to adequately secure such intellectual property rights from third parties 

 

our success depends in part upon our proprietary technology we generally rely on patents copyrights trademarks trade secret laws licenses and restrictive agreements to establish and protect our proprietary rights in technology and products despite the precautions we may take to protect our intellectual property third parties have tried in the past and may try in the future to challenge invalidate or circumvent these safeguards the rights granted under our patents or attendant to our other intellectual property may not provide us with any competitive advantages patents may not be issued on any of our pending applications and our issued patents may not be 

sufficiently broad to protect our technology furthermore the laws of foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights in those countries to the same extent as applicable law protects these rights in the united states the protection of our intellectual property may require the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources moreover the steps we take to protect our intellectual property may not adequately protect our rights or prevent third parties from infringing or misappropriating our proprietary rights 

 

many of our products include software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties we may have to seek new or renew existing licenses for such software and other intellectual property in the future our engineering services business holds licenses to certain software and other intellectual property owned by third parties including that of our competitors our failure to obtain software or other intellectual property licenses or other intellectual property rights that is necessary or helpful for our business on favorable terms or the need to engage in litigation over these licenses or rights could seriously harm our business operating results or financial condition 

 

we could lose key technology or suffer serious harm to our business because of the infringement of our intellectual property rights by third parties or because of our infringement of the intellectual property rights of third parties 

 

there are numerous patents in the eda industry and new patents are being issued at a rapid rate it is not always practicable to determine in advance whether a product or any of its components infringes the patent rights of others as a result from time to time we may be compelled to respond to or prosecute intellectual property infringement claims to protect our rights or defend a customer’s rights 

 

intellectual property infringement claims regardless of merit could consume valuable management time result in costly litigation or cause product shipment delays all of which could seriously harm our business operating results or financial condition in settling these claims we may be required to enter into royalty or licensing agreements with the third parties claiming infringement these royalty or licensing agreements if available may not have terms favorable to us being compelled to enter into a license agreement with unfavorable terms could seriously harm our business operating results or financial condition any potential intellectual property litigation could compel us to do one or more of the following 

 

  

if we were compelled to take any of these actions our business or operating results may suffer 

 

if our security measures are breached and an unauthorized party obtains access to customer data our information systems may be perceived as being unsecure and customers may curtail or stop their use of our products and services 

 

our products and services involve the storage and transmission of customers’ proprietary information and breaches of our security measures could expose us to a risk of loss or misuse of this information litigation and potential liability because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage information systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventive measures if an actual or perceived breach of our security occurs the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed and we could lose existing customers and our ability to obtain new customers 

the long sales cycle of our products and services makes the timing of our revenue difficult to predict and may cause our operating results to fluctuate unexpectedly 

 

generally we have a long sales cycle that can extend up to six months or longer the complexity and expense associated with our business generally require a lengthy customer education evaluation and approval process consequently we may incur substantial expenses and devote significant management effort and expense to develop potential relationships that do not result in agreements or revenue and may prevent us from pursuing other opportunities 

 

in addition sales of our products and services have been and may in the future be delayed if customers delay approval or commencement of projects because of 

 

  

long sales cycles for acceleration and emulation hardware products subject us to a number of significant risks over which we have limited control including insufficient excess or obsolete inventory variations in inventory valuation and fluctuations in quarterly operating results 

 

the majority of our contracts are executed in the final few weeks of a fiscal quarter this makes it difficult to determine with accuracy how much business will be executed in each fiscal quarter also because of the timing of large orders and our customers’ buying patterns we may not learn of orders shortfalls revenue shortfalls earnings shortfalls or other failures to meet market expectations until late in a fiscal quarter these factors may cause our operating results to fluctuate unexpectedly which can cause significant fluctuations in the trading price of our common stock 

 

our reported financial results may be adversely affected by changes in united states generally accepted accounting principles 

 

united states generally accepted accounting principles are subject to interpretation by the financial accounting standards board or fasb the american institute of certified public accountants the sec and various bodies formed to promulgate and interpret appropriate accounting principles a change in these principles or interpretations could have a significant effect on our reported financial results and could affect the reporting of transactions completed before the announcement of a change in addition the sec has announced a multiyear plan that could ultimately lead to the use of international financial reporting standards by united states issuers in their sec filings any such change could have a significant effect on our reported financial results 

 

the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations and other risks to our international operations may seriously harm our financial condition 

 

we have significant operations outside the united states our revenue from international operations as a percentage of total revenue was approximately 57 during fiscal 2009 58 during fiscal 2008 and 54 during fiscal 2007 we expect that revenue from our international operations will continue to account for a significant portion of our total revenue we also transact business in various foreign currencies primarily the japanese yen the volatility of foreign currencies in certain regions most notably the japanese yen european union euro british pound and indian rupee have had and may in the future have a harmful effect on our revenue or operating results 

 

fluctuations in the rate of exchange between the united states dollar and the currencies of other countries where we conduct business could seriously harm our business operating results or financial condition for example when a foreign currency declines in value relative to the united states dollar it takes more of the foreign currency to purchase the same amount of united states dollars than before the change if we price our products and services in the foreign currency we receive fewer united states dollars than we did before the change if we price our products and services in united states dollars the decrease in value of the local currency results in an increase in the price for our products and services compared to those products of our competitors that are priced in local currency this could result in our prices being uncompetitive in markets where business is transacted in the local currency on the other hand when a foreign currency increases in value relative to the united states dollar it takes more united states 

dollars to purchase the same amount of the foreign currency as we use the foreign currency to pay for payroll costs and other operating expenses in our international operations this results in an increase in operating expenses 

 

exposure to foreign currency transaction risk can arise when transactions are conducted in a currency different from the functional currency of one of our subsidiaries a subsidiary’s functional currency is generally the currency in which it primarily conducts its operations including product pricing expenses and borrowings although we attempt to reduce the impact of foreign currency fluctuations significant exchange rate movements may hurt our results of operations as expressed in united states dollars 

 

our international operations may also be subject to other risks including 

 

  

we have offices throughout the world including key research and development facilities outside of the united states our operations are dependent upon the connectivity of our operations throughout the world activities that interfere with our international connectivity such as computer hacking or the introduction of a virus into our computer systems could significantly interfere with our business operations 

 

our operating results could be adversely affected as a result of changes in our effective tax rates 

 

our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by the following 

 

  

any significant change in our future effective tax rates could adversely impact our results of operations for future periods 

we have received examination reports from the irs proposing deficiencies in certain of our tax returns and the outcome of current and future tax examinations may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows 

 

the irs and other tax authorities regularly examine our income tax returns and the irs is currently examining our federal income tax returns for the tax years 2006 through 2008 in july 2006 the irs completed its field examination of our federal income tax returns for the tax years 2000 through 2002 and issued a revenue agent’s report or rar in which the irs proposed to assess an aggregate tax deficiency for the threeyear period of approximately 3240 million in november 2006 the irs revised the proposed aggregate tax deficiency for the threeyear period to approximately 3180 million the irs is contesting our qualification for deferred recognition of certain proceeds received from restitution and settlement in connection with litigation during the period the proposed tax deficiency for this item is approximately 1520 million the remaining proposed tax deficiency of approximately 1660 million is primarily related to proposed adjustments to our transfer pricing arrangements with foreign subsidiaries and to our deductions for foreign trade income we have filed a timely protest with the irs and are seeking resolution of the issues through the appeals office of the irs or the appeals office 

 

in may 2009 the irs completed its field examination of our federal income tax returns for the tax years 2003 through 2005 and issued a rar in which the irs proposed to assess an aggregate deficiency for the threeyear period of approximately 941 million in august 2009 the irs revised the proposed aggregate tax deficiency for the threeyear period to approximately 607 million the irs is contesting our transfer pricing arrangements with our foreign subsidiaries and deductions for foreign trade income the irs made similar claims against our transfer pricing arrangements and deductions for foreign trade income in prior examinations and may make similar claims in its examinations of other tax years we have filed a timely protest with the irs and will seek resolution of the issues through the appeals office 

 

we believe that the proposed irs adjustments are inconsistent with applicable tax laws and we are vigorously challenging these proposed adjustments the rars are not final statutory notices of deficiency but the irs imposes interest on the proposed deficiencies until the matters are resolved interest is compounded daily at rates published and adjusted quarterly by the irs and have been between 4 and 10 since 2001 

 

the calculation of our provision benefit for income taxes requires us to use significant judgment and involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in determining the adequacy of our provision benefit for income taxes we regularly assess the potential settlement outcomes resulting from income tax examinations however the final outcome of tax examinations including the total amount payable or the timing of any such payments upon resolution of these issues cannot be estimated with certainty in addition we cannot be certain that such amount will not be materially different from the amount that is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals should the irs or other tax authorities assess additional taxes as a result of a current or a future examination we may be required to record charges to operations in future periods that could have a material impact on the results of operations financial position or cash flows in the applicable period or periods 

 

forecasting our estimated annual effective tax rate is complex and subject to uncertainty and material differences between forecasted and actual tax rates could have a material impact on our results of operations 

 

forecasts of our income tax position and resultant effective tax rate are complex and subject to uncertainty because our income tax position for each year combines the effects of estimating our annual income or loss the mix of profits and losses earned by us and our subsidiaries in tax jurisdictions with a broad range of income tax rates as well as benefits from available deferred tax assets the impact of various accounting rules and changes to these rules and results of tax audits to forecast our global tax rate pretax profits and losses by jurisdiction are estimated and tax expense by jurisdiction is calculated based on such estimates forecasts of annual income or loss that are near breakeven will cause our estimated annual effective tax rate to be particularly sensitive to any changes to our estimates of tax expense if our estimate of the pretax profit and losses the mix of our profits and losses our ability to use deferred tax assets the results of tax audits or effective tax rates by jurisdiction is different than those estimates our actual tax rate could be materially different than forecasted which could have a material impact on our results of operations 

failure to obtain export licenses could harm our business by rendering us unable to ship products and transfer our technology outside of the united states 

 

we must comply with regulations of the united states and of certain other countries in shipping our software products and transferring our technology outside the united states and to foreign nationals although we have not had any significant difficulty complying with such regulations so far any significant future difficulty in complying could harm our business operating results or financial condition 

 

errors or defects in our products and services could expose us to liability and harm our reputation 

 

our customers use our products and services in designing and developing products that involve a high degree of technological complexity each of which has its own specifications because of the complexity of the systems and products with which we work some of our products and designs can be adequately tested only when put to full use in the marketplace as a result our customers or their end users may discover errors or defects in our software or the systems we design or the products or systems incorporating our design and intellectual property may not operate as expected errors or defects could result in 

 

  

if we become subject to unfair hiring claims we could be prevented from hiring needed employees incur liability for damages and incur substantial costs in defending ourselves 

 

companies in our industry that lose employees to competitors frequently claim that these competitors have engaged in unfair hiring practices or that the employment of these persons would involve the disclosure or use of trade secrets these claims could prevent us from hiring employees or cause us to incur liability for damages we could also incur substantial costs in defending ourselves or our employees against these claims regardless of their merits defending ourselves from these claims could also divert the attention of our management away from our operations 

 

our business is subject to the risk of earthquakes 

 

our corporate headquarters including certain of our research and development operations and certain of our distribution facilities is located in the silicon valley area of northern california a region known to experience seismic activity if significant seismic activity were to occur our operations may be interrupted which would adversely impact our business and results of operations 

 

we maintain research and development and other facilities in parts of the world that are not as politically stable as the united states and as a result we may face a higher risk of business interruption from acts of war or terrorism than businesses located only or primarily in the united states 

 

we maintain international research and development and other facilities some of which are in parts of the world that are not as politically stable as the united states consequently we may face a greater risk of business interruption as a result of terrorist acts or military conflicts than businesses located domestically furthermore this potential harm is exacerbated given that damage to or disruptions at our international research and development facilities could have an adverse effect on our ability to develop new or improve existing products as compared to other businesses which may only have sales offices or other less critical operations abroad we are not insured for losses or interruptions caused by acts of war or terrorism 

risks related to our securities and indebtedness 

 

our debt obligations expose us to risks that could adversely affect our business operating results or financial condition and could prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under such indebtedness 

 

we have a substantial level of debt as of january 2 2010 we had outstanding indebtedness with a principal balance of 5002 million as follows 

 

  

the level of our current or future indebtedness among other things could 

 

  

while we are not currently a party to any loans that would prohibit us from making payment on our outstanding convertible notes we are not prevented by the terms of the convertible notes from entering into other loans that could prohibit such payments if we are prohibited from paying our outstanding indebtedness we could try to obtain the consent of the lenders under those arrangements to make such payment or we could attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain the restrictions if we do not obtain the necessary consents or refinance the borrowings we may be unable to satisfy our outstanding indebtedness any such failure would constitute an event of default under our indebtedness which could in turn constitute a default under the terms of any other indebtedness then outstanding 

 

if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow or otherwise obtain funds necessary to make required payments or if we fail to comply with the various requirements of our indebtedness we would be in default which would permit the holders of our indebtedness to accelerate the maturity of the indebtedness and could cause defaults under any other indebtedness as well 

 

we have in the past and may in the future attempt to access the capital or credit markets in order to obtain funding to meet particular capital or liquidity needs the capital and credit markets have contracted and when compounded by the difficult economic environment and our lower levels of business we may not be able to secure additional funding on terms acceptable to us or at all which may adversely impact our business and operating results 

 

any default under our indebtedness could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition in addition a material default on our indebtedness could suspend our eligibility to register securities using certain registration statement forms under sec guidelines that permit incorporation by reference of substantial information regarding us and potentially hindering our ability to raise capital through the issuance of our securities and will increase the costs of such registration to us 

 

on the first day of fiscal 2009 we retrospectively adopted new accounting principles as required by the “debt with conversion and other options” subtopic of the fasb accounting standards codification and adjusted all periods for which the convertible senior notes were outstanding before the date of adoption this adoption had an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition particularly with respect to interest expense ratios 

commonly referred to by lenders and could potentially hinder our ability to raise capital through the issuance of debt or equity securities 

 

conversion of the convertible senior notes will dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders 

 

the terms of the convertible senior notes permit the holders to convert the convertible senior notes into shares of our common stock the terms of the convertible senior notes stipulate a net share settlement which upon conversion of the convertible senior notes requires us to pay the principal amount in cash and the conversion premium if any in shares of our common stock based on a daily settlement amount calculated on a proportionate basis for each day of the relevant 20 tradingday observation period the initial conversion rate for the convertible senior notes is 472813 shares of our common stock per 1000 principal amount of convertible senior notes equivalent to a conversion price of approximately 2115 per share of our common stock the conversion price is subject to adjustment in some events but will not be adjusted for accrued interest except in limited circumstances the conversion of some or all of the convertible senior notes will dilute the ownership interest of our existing stockholders any sales in the public market of the common stock issuable upon conversion could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock 

 

each 1000 of principal of the convertible senior notes is initially convertible into 472813 shares of our common stock subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events holders of the convertible senior notes may convert their notes at their option on any day before the close of business on the scheduled trading day immediately preceding december 15 2011 in the case of the 2011 notes and december 15 2013 in the case of the 2013 notes in each case only if 

 

  

from november 2 2011 in the case of the 2011 notes and november 1 2013 in the case of the 2013 notes and until the close of business on the scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date of such convertible senior notes holders may convert their convertible senior notes at any time regardless of the foregoing circumstances as of january 2 2010 none of the conditions allowing holders of the convertible senior notes to convert had been met 

 

although the conversion price of the convertible senior notes is currently 2115 per share we entered into hedge and separate warrant transactions concurrent with the issuance of the convertible senior notes to reduce the potential dilution from the conversion of the convertible senior notes however we cannot guarantee that such hedges and warrant instruments will fully mitigate the dilution in addition the existence of the convertible senior notes may encourage short selling by market participants because the conversion of the convertible senior notes could depress the price of our common stock 

 

at the option of the holders of the convertible senior notes under certain circumstances we may be required to repurchase the convertible senior notes in cash or shares of our common stock 

 

under the terms of the convertible senior notes we may be required to repurchase the convertible senior notes following a “fundamental change” in our corporate ownership or structure such as a change of control in which substantially all of the consideration does not consist of publicly traded securities prior to maturity of the convertible senior notes the repurchase price for the convertible senior notes in the event of a fundamental change must be paid solely in cash this repayment obligation may have the effect of discouraging delaying or preventing a takeover of our company that may otherwise be beneficial to investors 

hedge and warrant transactions entered into in connection with the issuance of the convertible senior notes may affect the value of our common stock 

 

we entered into hedge transactions with various financial institutions at the time of issuance of the convertible senior notes with the objective of reducing the potential dilutive effect of issuing our common stock upon conversion of the convertible senior notes we also entered into separate warrant transactions with the same financial institutions in connection with our hedge and warrant transactions these financial institutions purchased our common stock in secondary market transactions and entered into various overthecounter derivative transactions with respect to our common stock these entities or their affiliates are likely to modify their hedge positions from time to time prior to conversion or maturity of the convertible senior notes by purchasing and selling shares of our common stock other of our securities or other instruments they may wish to use in connection with such hedging any of these transactions and activities could adversely affect the value of our common stock and as a result the number of shares and the value of the common stock holders will receive upon conversion of the convertible senior notes in addition subject to movement in the price of our common stock if the hedge transactions settle in our favor we could be exposed to credit risk related to the other party with respect to the payment we are owed from such other party if the financial institutions with which we entered into these hedge transactions were to fail or default our ability to settle on these transactions could be harmed or delayed 

 

rating agencies may provide unsolicited ratings on the convertible senior notes that could reduce the market value or liquidity of our common stock 

 

we have not requested a rating of the convertible senior notes from any rating agency and we do not anticipate that the convertible senior notes will be rated however if one or more rating agencies independently elects to rate the convertible senior notes and assigns the convertible senior notes a rating lower than the rating expected by investors or reduces such rating in the future the market price or liquidity of the convertible senior notes and our common stock could be harmed should a decline in the market price of the convertible senior notes result as compared to the price of our common stock this may trigger the right of the holders of the convertible senior notes to convert the convertible senior notes into cash and shares of our common stock 

 

antitakeover defenses in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and certain provisions under delaware law could prevent an acquisition of our company or limit the price that investors might be willing to pay for our common stock 

 

our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and certain provisions of the delaware general corporation law that apply to us could make it difficult for another company to acquire control of our company for example 

 

  

all or any one of these factors could limit the price that certain investors would be willing to pay for shares of our common stock and could allow our board of directors to resist delay or prevent an acquisition of our company even if a proposed transaction were favored by a majority of our independent stockholders

 item 2 properties 

 

we own land and buildings at our headquarters located in san jose california we also own buildings in india as of january 2 2010 the total square footage of our owned buildings was approximately 950000 

 

in january 2007 we completed the sale of certain of our land and buildings in san jose california concurrently with the sale we leased back from the purchaser all available space in the buildings for two years the lease term ended in january 2009 and we have vacated the leased buildings 

 

we lease additional facilities in the united states and various other countries we sublease certain of these facilities where space is not fully utilized or has been involved in restructuring plans 

 

we believe that these facilities including our newly constructed building located at our headquarters are adequate for our current needs and that suitable additional or substitute space will be available as needed to accommodate any expansion of our operations 

 




 item 3 legal proceedings 

 

from time to time we are involved in various disputes and litigation that arise in the ordinary course of business these include disputes and lawsuits related to intellectual property mergers and acquisitions licensing contracts distribution arrangements and employee relations matters at least quarterly we review the status of each significant matter and assess its potential financial exposure if the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount or the range of loss can be estimated we accrue a liability for the estimated loss legal proceedings are subject to uncertainties and the outcomes are difficult to predict because of such uncertainties accruals are based on our judgments using the best information available at the time as additional information becomes available we reassess the potential liability related to pending claims and litigation matters and may revise estimates 

 

during fiscal 2008 three complaints were filed in the united states district court for the northern district of california all alleging violations of sections 10b and 20a of the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended and rule 10b5 promulgated thereunder on behalf of a purported class of purchasers of cadence’s common stock we intend to continue to vigorously defend these complaints and any other securities lawsuits that may be filed see note 15 to our consolidated financial statements for additional details and the status of these complaints 

 

also during fiscal 2008 two derivative complaints were filed in santa clara county superior court these complaints purport to bring suit derivatively on behalf of cadence against certain of cadence’s current and former directors for alleged breach of fiduciary duty abuse of control gross mismanagement waste of corporate assets and unjust enrichment we are analyzing these derivative complaints and will respond to them appropriately the parties to these cases have agreed to a temporary stay of the proceedings see note 15 to our consolidated financial statements for additional details and the status of these complaints 

 

in light of the preliminary status of these lawsuits we cannot predict the outcome of these matters while the outcome of these litigation matters cannot be predicted with any certainty we do not believe that the outcome of any current matters will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position liquidity or results of operations

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

 

the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k and with item 1a “risk factors” please refer to the cautionary language at the beginning of part i of this annual report on form 10k regarding forwardlooking statements 

 

business overview 

 

we develop eda software and hardware we license software sell or lease hardware technology provide maintenance for our software and hardware and provide engineering and education services throughout the world to help manage and accelerate product development processes for electronics our customers use our products and services to design and develop complex ics and electronics systems during fiscal 2009 we had orders of 615 million 

 

we primarily generate revenue from licensing our eda software selling or leasing our hardware technology providing maintenance for our software and hardware and providing engineering services substantially all of our revenue is generated from ic manufacturers and designers and electronics systems companies and is dependent upon their commencement of new design projects as a result our revenue is significantly influenced by our customers’ business outlook and investment in the introduction of new products and the improvement of existing products 

 

critical accounting estimates 

 

in preparing our consolidated financial statements we make assumptions judgments and estimates that can have a significant impact on our revenue operating income and net income loss as well as on the value of certain assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets we base our assumptions judgments and estimates on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions at least quarterly we evaluate our assumptions judgments and estimates and make changes accordingly historically our assumptions judgments and estimates relative to our critical accounting estimates have not differed materially from actual results we believe that the assumptions judgments and estimates involved in the accounting for revenue recognition accounting for income taxes and allowance for doubtful accounts have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements therefore we consider these to be our critical accounting estimates for information on our significant accounting policies see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements 

 

revenue recognition 

 

we begin to recognize revenue from licensing and supporting our software and hardware products when all of the following criteria are met 

 

  

significant judgment is involved in the determination of whether the facts and circumstances of an arrangement support that the fee for the arrangement is considered to be fixed or determinable and that collectibility of the fee is probable and that judgment can impact the amount of revenue that we recognize in a reporting period we must also make these judgments when assessing whether a contract amendment to a term arrangement primarily in the context of a license extension or renewal constitutes a concession our experience has been that we are able to determine whether a fee is fixed or determinable for term licenses and we have established a history of collecting under the original contract without providing concessions on payments products 

or services however we have concluded that fees are not fixed or determinable for license arrangements executed with customers in certain countries 

 

for installment contracts that do not include a substantial up front payment we consider that a fee is fixed or determinable only if the arrangement has payment periods that are equal to or less than the term of the licenses and the payments are collected in equal or nearly equal installments when evaluated over the entire term of the arrangement while we do not expect that experience to change if we no longer were to have a history of collecting under the original contract without providing concessions on term licenses revenue from term licenses would be required to be recognized when payments under the installment contract become due and payable and are collectible such a change could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

 

our experience has been that we are generally able to estimate whether collection is probable significant judgment is applied as we assess the creditworthiness of our customers to make this determination if in our judgment collection of a fee is not probable we defer the revenue until the uncertainty is removed which generally means revenue is recognized upon receipt of cash payment if we were unable to determine that collection is probable such a change could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

 

a multiple element arrangement or mea is any arrangement that includes or contemplates rights to a combination of software or hardware products software license types services training or maintenance in a single arrangement from time to time we may include individual deliverables in separately priced and separately signed contracts with the same customer we obtain and evaluate all known relevant facts and circumstances in determining whether the separate contracts should be accounted for individually as distinct arrangements or whether the separate contracts are in substance a mea significant judgment can be involved in determining whether a group of contracts might be so closely related that they are in effect part of a single arrangement 

 

for our subscription licenses including “eda platinum cards” the software license agreements typically combine the right to use specified software products the right to maintenance and the right to receive and use unspecified future software products for no additional fee when and if available during the term of the license agreement under these license agreements when all four of the revenue recognition criteria outlined above are met we recognize revenue ratably over the term of the license agreement beginning with delivery of the first product subscription license revenue is allocated to product and maintenance revenue the allocation to maintenance revenue is based on the average substantive renewal rates included in the sale of similar term license arrangements in the event that the license fee for this type of arrangement is not considered to be fixed or determinable at the outset of the arrangement we recognize revenue at the lesser of i the prorata portion of the license fee for the applicable period or ii as payments from the customer become due if all other conditions for revenue recognition have been satisfied 

 

for term and perpetual licenses including “eda gold cards” when all four of the revenue recognition criteria outlined above are met software license fees are recognized as revenue generally with product fees associated with the specified products recognized “upfront” upon completion of delivery and with the maintenance fees recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance period under our current business model a relatively small percentage of our revenue from software licenses is recognized on an upfront basis 

 

license agreements under which software fees are recognized upfront do not include the right to receive unspecified future software products however in the event such license agreements are executed within close proximity or in contemplation of other license agreements that require ratable revenue recognition with the same customer the licenses together may be deemed a mea in which event all such revenue would be recognized over multiple periods 

 

revenue from service contracts is recognized either on the time and materials method as work is performed or on the percentageofcompletion method for contracts with fixed or nottoexceed fees we estimate on a monthly basis the percentage of completion based on the completion of milestones relating to the arrangement we have a history of accurately estimating project status and the costs necessary to complete projects a number of internal and external factors can affect our estimates including labor rates utilization and efficiency variances and specification and testing requirement changes if different conditions were to prevail such that accurate estimates could not be made then the use of the completed contract method would be required and the recognition of all 

revenue and costs would be deferred until the project was completed such a change could have a material impact on our results of operations 

 

accounting for income taxes 

 

we provide for the effect of income taxes in our consolidated financial statements using the asset and liability method we also apply a twostep approach to determining the financial statement recognition and measurement of uncertain tax positions 

 

income tax expense or benefit is recognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and for deferred tax assets and liabilities for the tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity’s financial statements or tax returns we must make significant assumptions judgments and estimates to determine our current provision benefit for income taxes our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance to be recorded against our deferred tax assets our judgments assumptions and estimates relating to the current provision benefit for income taxes include the geographic mix and amount of income loss our interpretation of current tax laws and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax authorities our judgments also include anticipating the tax positions we will take on tax returns before actually preparing and filing the tax returns changes in our business tax laws or our interpretation of tax laws and developments in current and future tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our results of operations financial position or cash flows 

 

deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to tax benefit carryforwards and to differences between the financial statement amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis we regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized to make this assessment we take into account predictions of the amount and category of taxable income from various sources and all available positive and negative evidence about these possible sources of taxable income the weight given to the potential effect of negative and positive evidence is commensurate with the extent to which the strength of the evidence can be objectively verified for example a company’s current year or previous year losses are given more weight than its future outlook for the years ended january 2 2010 and january 3 2009 we concluded that a significant valuation allowance was required based on our evaluation and weighting of the positive and negative evidence if in the future we determine that these deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized a release of all or part of the related valuation allowance could result in a material income tax benefit in the period such determination is made for additional description of the valuation allowance see note 4 to our consolidated financial statements 

 

we only recognize an income tax position in our financial statements that we judge is more likely than not to be sustained solely on its technical merits in a tax audit including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes to make this judgment we must interpret complex and sometimes ambiguous tax laws regulations and administrative practices if an income tax position meets the more likely than not recognition threshold then we must measure the amount of the tax benefit to be recognized by determining the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than a 50 likelihood of being realized upon effective settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all of the relevant facts it is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts as this requires us to determine the probability of various possible settlement outcomes to determine if a tax position is effectively settled we must also estimate the likelihood that a taxing authority would review a tax position after a tax examination has otherwise been completed we must also determine when it is reasonably possible that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits will significantly increase or decrease in the 12 months after each fiscal yearend these judgments are difficult because a taxing authority may change its behavior as a result of our disclosures in our financial statements we must reevaluate our income tax positions on a quarterly basis to consider factors such as changes in facts or circumstances changes in tax law effectively settled issues under audit and new audit activity such a change in recognition or measurement would result in recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision 

 

we are also required to assess whether the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries will be indefinitely reinvested outside the united states as of january 2 2010 we had recognized a deferred tax liability of 347 million related 

to 679 million of earnings from certain foreign subsidiaries that are not considered indefinitely invested outside the united states to calculate the tax liability for the repatriation of these earnings we are required to estimate the geographic mix of profits and losses earned by us and our subsidiaries in tax jurisdictions with a broad range of income and dividend withholding tax rates the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations and the potential outcomes of current and future tax audits changes in our actual or projected operating results tax laws or our interpretation of tax laws foreign exchange rates and developments in current and future tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our results of operations financial position or cash flows 

 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

 

we make judgments as to our ability to collect outstanding receivables and provide allowances for a portion of receivables when collection becomes doubtful this allowance is based on our assessment of the creditworthiness of our customers historical experience and the overall economic climate of the industries that we serve while we believe that our allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate we continue to monitor customer liquidity and other economic conditions which may result in changes to our estimates regarding our ability to collect from our customers changes in circumstances such as an unexpected change in a customer’s ability to meet its financial obligation to us or a customer’s payment trends are hard to predict and may require us to adjust our estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to us these changes could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results as a result of our assessment of increased risk of customer delays or defaults on payment obligations we have increased our allowance for doubtful accounts to 237 million as of january 2 2010 as compared to 75 million as of january 3 2009 

 

results of operations 

 

overview of fiscal 2009 

 

our fiscal 2009 financial results reflected the following 

 

  

revenue 

 

we primarily generate revenue from licensing our eda software selling or leasing our hardware technology providing maintenance for our software and hardware and providing engineering services we principally utilize three license types subscription term and perpetual the different license types provide a customer with different conditions of use for our products such as 

 

 34 

 

the timing of our product revenue is significantly affected by the mix of orders executed in any given period for some orders such as subscription orders product and maintenance revenue is recognized ratably over multiple periods in addition depending on the individual facts and circumstances of particular orders we have some orders where product and maintenance revenue is recognized as payments become due and some where revenue is only recognized when payment is received for other orders all product revenue is recognized upfront in the same quarter in which the order is executed 

 

we seek to achieve a mix of orders with approximately 90 of the total value of all executed orders consisting of orders for which the revenue is recurring or ratable in nature with the balance of the orders made up of orders for which the product revenue is recognized upfront during fiscal 2009 approximately 90 of the total value of our executed orders was comprised of ratable revenue orders if we achieve this desired mix of executed orders over time and there are no significant changes to our business eventually approximately 90 of our revenue would come from ratable orders 

 

customer decisions regarding these aspects of license transactions determine the license type timing of revenue recognition and potential future business activity for example if a customer chooses a fixed duration of use this will result in either a subscription or term license a business implication of this decision is that at the expiration of the license period the customer must decide whether to continue using the technology and therefore renew the license agreement historically larger customers generally used products from two or more of our five product groups and rarely completely terminated their relationship with us upon expiration of the license see the discussion under the heading “critical accounting estimates – revenue recognition” and note 2 of our consolidated financial statements for additional descriptions of license types and timing of revenue recognition 

 

although we believe that pricing volatility has not generally been a material component of the change in our revenue from period to period we believe that the amount of revenue recognized in future periods will depend on among other things the 

 

   

the value and duration of contracts and consequently product revenue recognized is affected by the competitiveness of our products product revenue recognized in any period is also affected by the extent to which customers purchase subscription term or perpetual licenses and the extent to which contracts contain flexible payment terms the timing of revenue recognition is also affected by changes in the extent to which existing contracts contain flexible payment terms and by changes in contractual arrangements with existing customers eg customers transitioning from subscription license arrangements to term license arrangements 

 

revenue mix 

 

we analyze our software and hardware businesses by product group combining revenues for both product and maintenance because of their interrelationship during fiscal 2009 fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007 our product groups were as follows 

 

functional verification  products in this group including the incisive functional verification platform are used to verify that the high level logical representation of an ic design is functionally correct 

 

digital ic design  products in this group including the encounter digital ic design platform are used to accurately convert the highlevel logical representation of a digital ic into a detailed physical blueprint and then detailed design information showing how the ic will be physically implemented this data is used for creation of the photomasks used to manufacture semiconductors 

 

custom ic design  our custom design products including the virtuoso custom design platform are used for ics that must be designed at the transistor level including analog rf memory high performance digital blocks and 

standard cell libraries detailed design information showing how an ic will be physically implemented is used for creation of the photomasks used to manufacture semiconductors 

 

system interconnect design  this product group consists of our pcb and ic package design products including the allegro and orcad ® products the allegro system interconnect design platform enables consistent codesign of interconnects across ics ic packages and pcbs while the orcad line focuses on costeffective entrylevel pcb solutions 

 

design for manufacturing  included in this product group are our physical verification and analysis products these products are used to analyze and verify that the physical blueprint of the ic has been constructed correctly and can be manufactured successfully our strategy includes focusing on integrating dfm awareness into our core design platforms of encounter digital ic design and virtuoso custom design 

 

for additional description of our current product strategy see the discussion under the heading “products and product strategy” under item 1 “business” 

 

revenue by year 

 

the following table shows our revenue for fiscal 2009 fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007 and the dollar change in revenue between years 

 

 

 

product revenue decreased during each of fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 primarily because of lower business levels due to the challenges in the macroeconomic environment the timing of our contract renewals with existing customers our transition to a ratable license mix and a longer sales cycle as a result product revenue decreased for all product groups and particularly for digital ic design custom ic design and functional verification products during both fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008 we expect to recognize increased revenue during fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 due to higher business levels and our continued transition to our more ratable business model 

 

services revenue decreased during fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 because of lower business levels due to the challenges in the macroeconomic environment and an increase in the proportion of arrangements for which revenue is deferred until payments become due and payable or cash is received from customers primarily as a result of our assessment of the increased risk of customer delays or defaults on payment obligations 

 

maintenance revenue decreased during fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 due to the following 

 

 36 

 

the following table shows the percentage of product and related maintenance revenue contributed by each of our five product groups and services and other during fiscal 2009 fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007 

 

 

 

as described under the heading “critical accounting estimates” certain of our licenses allow customers the ability to remix among software products additionally we have licensed a combination of our products to customers with the actual product selection and number of licensed users to be determined at a later date for these arrangements we estimate the allocation of the revenue to product groups based upon the expected usage of our products by these customers the actual usage of our products by these customers may differ and if that proves to be the case the revenue allocation in the above table would differ 

 

although we believe the methodology of allocating revenue to product groups is reasonable there can be no assurance that such allocated amounts reflect the amounts that would result had the customer individually licensed each specific software solution at the onset of the arrangement 

 

revenue by geography 

 

 

 

revenue by geography as a percentage of total revenue 

 

 

 

no single customer accounted for 10 or more of total revenue during fiscal 2009 fiscal 2008 or fiscal 2007 

 

changes in foreign currency exchange rates caused our revenue to increase by 78 million during fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 primarily due to a decrease in the value of the united states dollar when compared to the japanese yen partially offset by an increase in the value of the united states dollar when compared to the british pound and the european union euro changes in foreign currency exchange rates caused our revenue to increase by 245 million in fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 primarily due to a decrease in the value of the united states 

dollar when compared to the japanese yen and the european union euro partially offset by an increase in the value of the united states dollar when compared to the british pound additional information about revenue and other financial information by geography can be found in note 21 to our consolidated financial statements 

 

stockbased compensation expense summary 

 

stockbased compensation expense is reflected throughout our costs and expenses during fiscal 2009 fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007 as follows 

 

 

 

stockbased compensation expense decreased by 266 million during fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 and 201 million during fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 due to the following 

 

  

stockbased compensation expense during fiscal 2008 also decreased as compared to fiscal 2007 due to the reversal of 65 million of stockbased compensation expense related to the modification of certain performancebased restricted stock awards partially offset by an increase in stock option expense due to the acceleration of vesting of certain executives that resigned during fiscal 2008 

 

we expect stockbased compensation expense to continue to decrease during fiscal 2010 primarily due to lower fair values at grant dates for restricted stock and stock options the cancellation of restricted stock and stock options as a result of our restructuring plans and other attrition and a reduced number of equity grants during fiscal 2010 

 

effects of restructuring plans 

 

we plan operating expense levels primarily based on forecasted revenue levels to offset some of the impact of the decrease in our revenue we have implemented cost savings initiatives including reducing headcount and related costs and reducing other discretionary spending during fiscal 2008 we initiated a restructuring plan to improve our operating results and to align our cost structure with expected revenue this restructuring plan decreased costs during fiscal 2009 by reducing our workforce throughout the company by approximately 625 positions we expect ongoing annual savings of approximately 1500 million related to the restructuring activities and other expense reductions initiated in fiscal 2008 

 

during fiscal 2009 we initiated an additional restructuring plan to improve our operating results and to align our cost structure with expected revenue the 2009 restructuring plan which we initiated during the second quarter of fiscal 2009 and continued during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 is intended to decrease costs by reducing our workforce throughout the company by approximately 345 positions we expect ongoing annual savings of 

approximately 300 million related to the restructuring activities initiated during the second quarter of fiscal 2009 we expect that substantially all of the estimated restructuring planrelated annual operating expense savings related to the 2009 restructuring activities that we initiated during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 and announced in january 2010 will be offset by increased spending in connection with developing and enhancing our product technologies see note 5 to our consolidated financial statements for additional details of these and our prior restructuring plans 

 

cost of revenue 

 

 

 

the following table shows cost of revenue as a percentage of related revenue for fiscal 2009 fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007 

 

 

 

cost of services as a percentage of services revenue increased during fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 primarily due to decreased services revenue during fiscal 2009 as noted above 

 

cost of product 

 

cost of product includes costs associated with the sale or lease of our hardware and licensing of our software products cost of product primarily includes the cost of employee salary benefits and other employeerelated costs including stockbased compensation expense amortization of acquired intangibles directly related to our products the cost of technical documentation and royalties payable to thirdparty vendors cost of product associated with our hardware products also includes materials assembly and overhead these additional manufacturing costs make our cost of hardware product higher as a percentage of revenue than our cost of software product 

 

a summary of cost of product during fiscal 2009 fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007 is as follows 

 

 

cost of product decreased by 182 million during fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 and 98 million during fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 due to the following 

 

 

 

hardware costs decreased during fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 primarily due to a decrease in hardware sales and a writeoff of obsolete inventory that did not recur during fiscal 2009 hardware costs decreased during fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 primarily due to a decrease in hardware sales partially offset by a writeoff of obsolete inventory during fiscal 2008 

 

amortization of acquired intangibles decreased during fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 due to the impairment of certain acquired intangibles during fiscal 2008 amortization of acquired intangibles decreased during fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 because certain acquired intangible assets became fully amortized during the related periods 

 

cost of product depends primarily upon the extent to which we acquire intangible assets acquire licenses and incorporate thirdparty technology in our products that are licensed or sold in any given period and the actual mix of hardware and software product sales in any given period cost of product as a percentage of product revenue increased during fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 primarily due to decreased software product revenue during fiscal 2008 

 

cost of services 

 

cost of services primarily includes employee salary benefits and other employeerelated costs costs to maintain the infrastructure necessary to manage a services organization and provisions for contract losses if any cost of services decreased by 128 million during fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 and increased 99 million during fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 due to the following 

 

 

 

cost of maintenance 

 

cost of maintenance includes the cost of customer services such as hotline and onsite support employee salary benefits and other employeerelated costs and documentation of maintenance updates cost of maintenance 

decreased by 92 million during fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 and 53 million during fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 due to the following 

 

 

 

operating expenses 

 

 

 

operating expenses decreased during fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 primarily due to reduced headcount and related costs as a result of our 2008 and 2009 restructuring plans and our cost savings initiatives to reduce discretionary spending in addition fiscal 2008 was a 53week fiscal year while fiscal 2009 was a 52week fiscal year operating expenses decreased during fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 primarily due to reduced headcount and related costs and our cost savings initiatives to reduce discretionary spending 

 

during fiscal 2007 we recognized a gain on the sale of land and buildings that related to and accordingly reduced operating expense for that period there was no similar reduction during fiscal 2008 

 

the following table shows operating expenses as percentage of total revenue for fiscal 2009 fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007 

 

 

 

our operating expenses as a percentage of total revenue increased during fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 due to our lower product revenue during the period 

marketing and sales 

 

marketing and sales expense decreased by 716 million during fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 and 487 million during fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 due to the following 

 

 

 

research and development 

 

research and development expense decreased by 1032 million during fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 and 361 million during fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 due to the following 

 

 

general and administrative 

 

general and administrative expense decreased by 293 million during fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 and 170 million during fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 due to the following 

 

 

 

legal and other professional services costs decreased during fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 primarily due to a decrease in professional services fees related to our proposed acquisition of mentor graphics corporation and the restatement of our previously issued financial statements for the periods ended march 29 2008 and june 28 2008 that did not recur during fiscal 2009 see additional discussion of our current litigation in note 15 to our consolidated financial statements legal and other professional services costs decreased during fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 due to litigation costs incurred during fiscal 2007 that did not recur during fiscal 2008 partially offset by increased professional services fees related to our proposed acquisition of mentor graphics corporation and the restatement of our previously issued financial statements for the periods ended march 29 2008 and june 28 2008 

 

losses on the sale of installment contract receivables decreased during fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 and during fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 due to a reduction in sales of receivables the change in our license mix has resulted in an increased number of subscription licenses and a decrease in the sale of receivables to financial institutions because we generally do not sell the receivables associated with subscription licenses also as a result of the credit losses recorded by banks during 2008 and 2009 and the financial challenges experienced by banks a number of banks have become less willing to purchase assets because of capital constraints and concerns about overexposure to the technology sector 

 

bad debt expense increased during fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 and during fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 because certain of our customers experienced and may continue to experience adverse changes in their business which has resulted and may continue to result in a delay or default on their payment obligations 

 

executive severance costs during fiscal 2008 relate to the cash payable to three of the five executives who resigned in october 2008 the expense related to the other two resignations of executives is included in our sales and marketing and research and development expenses 

amortization of acquired intangibles 

 

 

 

amortization of acquired intangibles decreased 113 million during fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 and increased 33 million during fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 due to the following 

 

 

 

restructuring and other charges 

 

we have initiated multiple restructuring plans since 2001 including a 2009 restructuring plan which includes restructuring activities initiated during the second quarter of fiscal 2009 as well as restructuring activities initiated during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 and announced in january 2010 these restructuring activities initiated during fiscal 2009 are together referred to as the 2009 restructuring plan see note 5 to our consolidated financial statements for additional details of these restructuring plans 

 

because the restructuring charges and related benefits are derived from management’s estimates made during the formulation of the restructuring plans based on thencurrently available information our restructuring plans may not achieve the benefits anticipated on the timetable or at the level contemplated demand for our products and services and ultimately our future financial performance is difficult to predict with any degree of certainty and is especially difficult to predict in light of the current economic challenges and uncertainty accordingly additional actions including further restructuring of our operations may be required in the future 

 

2009 restructuring plan 

 

we have recorded total costs associated with the 2009 restructuring plan of 351 million the costs recorded as part of the 2009 restructuring plan include severance payments severancerelated benefits and costs for outplacement services that were communicated to the affected employees before january 2 2010 and estimated severance payments and related benefits that were both probable and estimable as of january 2 2010 for employees notified after january 2 2010 

 

total severance and termination benefits of approximately 163 million related to the 2009 restructuring plan were paid to employees before january 2 2010 approximately 186 million of severance and termination benefits related to the 2009 restructuring plan will be paid after january 2 2010 all of which is included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet as of january 2 2010 due to varying regulations in the jurisdictions and countries in which we operate we expect substantially all termination benefits to be paid by january 1 2011 we expect ongoing annual savings of approximately 300 million related to the restructuring activities initiated during the second quarter of 2009 we expect that substantially all of the estimated restructuring planrelated annual operating expense savings related to the 2009 restructuring activities which we initiated during the fourth quarter of 2009 and announced in january 2010 will be offset by increased spending in connection with developing and enhancing our product technologies 

2008 restructuring plan 

 

the following table presents restructuring and other charges for the 2008 restructuring plan 

 

 

 

during fiscal 2008 we recorded 443 million of headcount reduction costs associated with the 2008 restructuring plan including severance payments severancerelated benefits and costs for outplacement services substantially all of which was paid by january 2 2010 

 

during fiscal 2009 we recorded a net reversal of 25 million consisting of reversals of 30 million in termination and related benefits costs that were less than initially estimated and 14 million of excess facilities costs due to a reduction in the estimated lease obligation associated with a facility vacated as part of the 2008 restructuring plan partially offset by restructuring expense of 19 million related to facilities included in the 2008 restructuring plan that we exited during fiscal 2009 

 

other restructuring plans 

 

we recorded credits to restructuring and other charges credits of 12 million during fiscal 2009 03 million during fiscal 2008 and 97 million during fiscal 2007 during fiscal 2009 we recorded a release of 12 million of excess facilities costs due to a reduction in the estimated lease obligation associated with a facility vacated as part of the 2002 restructuring plan and a reduction in other facilities costs that were less than initially estimated 

 

during fiscal 2007 we completed a lease termination agreement for a facility included in the 2001 restructuring plan whereby we paid 82 million and were released from all future obligations related to the facility we recorded a credit to restructuring and other charges of 71 million during fiscal 2007 representing the lease loss accrual related to this facility in excess of the amount paid 

 

impairment of goodwill 

 

we conduct a goodwill impairment analysis annually and as necessary if changes in facts and circumstances indicate that the fair value of our reporting unit may be less than the carrying amount we completed an interim goodwill impairment test during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 and recorded an impairment of goodwill of 13172 million representing all of our goodwill for additional description of our impairment of goodwill see note 13 to our consolidated financial statements 

 

impairment of intangible and tangible assets 

 

in connection with our cost savings initiatives that were implemented during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 we made certain changes to our dfm product strategy as a result we recognized an impairment charge of 425 million arising from the abandonment of certain identifiable intangible assets and reducing to net realizable value certain other identifiable intangible assets we also abandoned and impaired 46 million of other longlived assets during fiscal 2008 

 

interest expense 

 

 

on the first day of fiscal 2009 we adopted new accounting principles as required by the “debt with conversion and other options” subtopic of the fasb accounting standards codification which requires issuers of certain types of convertible notes to separately account for the liability and equity components in a manner that will reflect the entity’s nonconvertible debt borrowing rate when interest cost is recognized in subsequent periods this retroactive adoption required us to adjust our consolidated financial statements for prior years to reflect increased interest expense in each of those years the primary components of interest expense for fiscal 2009 fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007 consisted of the noncash component associated with the amortization of the debt discount as required under these new accounting principles and the contractual interest expense of our convertible senior notes 

 

other income expense net 

 

other income expense net for fiscal 2009 fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007 was as follows 

 

 

 

the decrease in interest income during fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 and during fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 was due to lower average cash balances and lower interest rates 

 

we determined that certain of our nonmarketable securities were otherthantemporarily impaired and we wrote down the investments by 52 million during fiscal 2009 86 million during fiscal 2008 and 26 million during fiscal 2007 during fiscal 2008 we determined that two of our availableforsale securities were otherthantemporarily impaired based on the severity and the duration of the impairments and we wrote down the investments by 81 million all of these impairments are included in the writedown of investments line in the above table 

 

during fiscal 2008 we purchased approximately 43 million shares of mentor graphics common stock in connection with our proposed acquisition of mentor graphics after the announcement of our withdrawal of the proposed acquisition of mentor graphics during fiscal 2008 we sold our entire equity interest in mentor graphics at a loss of 94 million which is included in the gains losses on availableforsale securities line in the above table 

 

the 93 million loss on liquidation of subsidiary is primarily attributable to currency translation adjustment losses net of gains previously recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income on our consolidated balance sheet for a subsidiary that was completely liquidated during fiscal 2008 

provision benefit for income taxes 

 

the provision benefit for income taxes and the effective tax rates during fiscal 2009 fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007 were as follows 

 

 

 

during fiscal 2009 a change in united states federal tax law allowed companies to elect to carry back the fiscal 2009 net operating loss for a period of three four or five years instead of the general twoyear carryback period our benefit for income taxes during fiscal 2009 is primarily due to 273 million of tax benefit from the fiscal 2009 united states federal net operating losses that can be utilized to offset taxable income in prior years that is partially offset by current year interest expense related to unrecognized tax benefits of 133 million and an increase in unrecognized tax benefits penalties and interest related to prior year tax positions of 145 million with the exception of the fiscal 2009 united states federal net operating loss that can be utilized in prior years we recorded a valuation allowance that offset the tax benefit from other fiscal 2009 united states losses and tax credits 

 

the 145 million increase in unrecognized tax benefits penalties and interest during fiscal 2009 included 73 million of unrecognized tax benefits penalties and interest that should have been recognized during multiple periods between fiscal 2004 through fiscal 2008 the effects on our fiscal 2009 results and our consolidated financial statements for prior periods are not considered material 

 

we had a fiscal 2008 provision for income taxes primarily due to the significant fiscal 2008 tax expenses related to the impairment of nondeductible goodwill the increase in our valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets and our decision to repatriate previously untaxed foreign earnings during fiscal 2008 we recognized the impairment of 10597 million of united states goodwill that was nondeductible we also increased the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets by 3260 million because of the uncertainty regarding their ultimate realization in making this judgment we considered the fiscal 2008 loss that resulted in a cumulative threeyear loss and other factors finally given the challenges in the global capital markets during fiscal 2008 we decided that 3172 million of previously untaxed earnings from foreign subsidiaries would not be indefinitely reinvested outside of the united states as a result we accrued a tax expense of 1011 million during fiscal 2008 to provide for the federal state and foreign income taxes on these repatriations 

 

our effective tax rate was negative for fiscal 2008 as compared to the positive effective tax rate for fiscal 2007 primarily due to the fiscal 2008 loss before provision for income taxes and the fiscal 2008 tax expenses related to the impairment of nondeductible goodwill the increase in our valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets and our decision to repatriate previously untaxed foreign earnings the fiscal 2007 effective tax rate reflects the 278 million tax benefit from the fiscal 2007 effective settlement of the irs exam for the 19971999 tax years 

 

we expect our effective tax rate for fiscal 2010 to be negative our expectation excludes the impact of possible effective settlements of tax examinations that may occur during fiscal 2010 the effective tax rate is negative because we expect to record a loss before provision for income taxes during fiscal 2010 and because we expect to have tax expense on the income of certain foreign subsidiaries and interest expense on our unrecognized tax benefits in addition we currently anticipate recording a valuation allowance that will offset the potential tax benefit of certain tax loss and credit carryforwards generated during fiscal 2010 

 

we intend to indefinitely reinvest approximately 790 million of undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries as of january 2 2010 to meet the working capital and longterm capital needs of our foreign subsidiaries the unrecognized deferred tax liability for these indefinitely reinvested foreign earnings was approximately 353 million as of january 2 2010 

 

we regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized we concluded that a valuation 

allowance of 3832 million was required as of january 2 2010 this represents an increase in valuation allowance of 520 million in comparison with the year ended january 3 2009 if in the future we determine that these deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized a release of all or part of the related valuation allowance could result in a material income tax benefit in the period such determination is made 

 

the irs and other tax authorities regularly examine our income tax returns and we have received rars indicating that the irs has proposed to assess certain tax deficiencies for further discussion regarding our income taxes including the calculation of our valuation allowance our deferred tax assets and the status of the irs examinations see note 4 to our consolidated financial statements 

 

liquidity and capital resources 

 

 

 

cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments 

 

as of january 2 2010 our principal sources of liquidity consisted of 5713 million of cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments as compared to 5721 million as of january 3 2009 and 10781 million as of december 29 2007 

 

our primary sources of cash during fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008 were 

 

  

our primary uses of cash during fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008 were 

 

  

we expect that current cash and shortterm investment balances and cash flows that are generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital other capital and liquidity requirements for at least the next 12 months 

net working capital 

 

net working capital increased 630 million as of january 2 2010 as compared to january 3 2009 and decreased 3536 million as of january 3 2009 as compared to december 29 2007 due to the following 

 

 

 

cash flows from operating activities 

 

net cash provided by operating activities decreased 447 million during fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 and 3321 million during fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 due to the following 

 

 

 

cash flows from operating activities include net income loss adjusted for certain noncash charges as well as changes in the balances of certain assets and liabilities our cash flows from operating activities are significantly influenced by business levels the payment terms set forth in our license agreements and by sales of our receivables as a result of the challenging economic environment our customers who are primarily concentrated in the semiconductor sector have experienced and may continue to experience adverse changes in their business and as a result may delay purchasing our products and services or delay or default on their payment obligations approximately half of our total receivables net and installment contract receivables net as of january 2 2010 relate to ten of our customers if our customers are not successful in generating sufficient cash or are precluded from securing financing they may not be able to pay or may delay payment of accounts receivable that are owed to us although these obligations are generally not cancelable our customers’ inability to fulfill payment obligations may adversely affect our cash flow additionally our customers may seek to renegotiate preexisting contractual commitments though we have not yet experienced a material level of defaults any material payment default by our customers or significant reductions in existing contractual commitments would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results 

 

we have entered into agreements whereby we may transfer accounts receivable to certain financial institutions on a nonrecourse or limitedrecourse basis during fiscal 2009 we transferred accounts receivable to financial institutions on a nonrecourse basis totaling 58 million net of the losses on the sale of the receivables as compared to 522 million during fiscal 2008 and 2154 million during fiscal 2007 the change in our license mix 

has resulted in an increased number of subscription licenses and therefore a decrease in the sale of receivables to financial institutions for additional information regarding our sales of receivables see note 17 to our consolidated financial statements 

 

during fiscal 2008 and the second quarter of fiscal 2009 we initiated restructuring plans to decrease costs by reducing our workforce and by consolidating facilities and we expect ongoing annual savings of approximately 1800 million related to these restructuring activities and other expense reductions in january 2010 we announced additional restructuring activities that we initiated during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 we expect that substantially all of the estimated annual operating expense savings associated with the restructuring activities announced in january 2010 will be offset by increased spending in connection with developing and enhancing our product technologies 

 

as of january 2 2010 we had made payments in connection with these restructuring plans in the amount of 591 million and we expect to pay an additional amount of 208 million we expect substantially all termination benefits related to these restructuring plans to be paid by january 1 2011 

 

cash flows from investing activities 

 

our primary investing activities during fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008 consisted of 

 

  

net cash used for investing activities decreased 764 million during fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 and increased 185 million during fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 due to the following 

 

 

 

in january 2007 we completed the sale of certain land and buildings in san jose california for a sales price of 465 million in cash concurrently with the sale we leased back from the purchaser all available space in the buildings during the lease term we constructed an additional building on our san jose california campus to replace the buildings we sold in this transaction the decrease in cash payments for property plant and equipment during fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 is primarily due to the completion of this new building in january 2009 

 

during fiscal 2008 we purchased approximately 43 million shares of mentor graphics common stock for 624 million in connection with our proposed acquisition of mentor graphics after the announcement of our withdrawal of the proposed acquisition of mentor graphics we sold our entire equity interest in mentor graphics for 530 million 

in connection with our acquisitions completed before january 2 2010 we may be obligated to pay up to an aggregate of 159 million in cash during the next 32 months if certain defined performance goals are achieved in full of which 81 million would be included as compensation expense in our consolidated statements of operations 

 

we expect to continue our investing activities including purchasing property plant and equipment purchasing intangible assets purchasing software licenses business combinations and making longterm equity investments 

 

cash flows from financing activities 

 

financing cash flows during fiscal 2009 consisted primarily of the issuance of common stock under certain employee plans 

 

net cash provided by financing activities was 210 million during fiscal 2009 as compared to net cash used in financing activities of 4434 million during fiscal 2008 and 1701 million during fiscal 2007 the changes in our financing cash flows are due to the following 

 

 

 

the decrease in proceeds from the issuance of common stock during fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 is primarily due to decreased purchase limits under our espp which became effective during fiscal 2009 we did not repurchase any of our common stock during fiscal 2009 as of january 2 2010 we had 8544 million remaining under the stock repurchase programs authorized by our board of directors 

 

during fiscal 2008 we repurchased 2302 million principal amount of the 2023 notes upon election of the holders of the 2023 notes pursuant to the terms thereof for total consideration of 2308 million 

 

we record a gain or loss on reissuance of treasury stock based on the total proceeds received in the transaction during fiscal 2009 we recorded losses on the reissuance of treasury stock of 2134 million as a component of retained earnings accumulated deficit 

 

other factors affecting liquidity and capital resources 

 

income taxes 

 

we provide for united states income taxes on earnings of our foreign subsidiaries unless the earnings are considered indefinitely invested outside the united states as of january 2 2010 we had recognized a deferred tax liability of 347 million related to 679 million of earnings from certain foreign subsidiaries that are not considered indefinitely reinvested outside the united states and for which we have previously made a provision for income tax we repatriated 500 million of the 679 million during january 2010 and expect to repatriate 129 million of the remainder during fiscal 2010 we estimate that the fiscal 2010 repatriations will result in fiscal 2010 cash tax payments of approximately 22 million 

 

we intend to indefinitely reinvest approximately 790 million of undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries as of january 2 2010 to meet the working capital and longterm capital needs of our foreign 

subsidiaries the unrecognized deferred tax liability for these indefinitely reinvested foreign earnings was approximately 353 million as of january 2 2010 

 

the irs and other tax authorities regularly examine our income tax returns and we have received rars pursuant to which the irs has proposed to assess certain tax deficiencies for additional description of our irs examinations see note 4 to our consolidated financial statements 

 

as of january 2 2010 we had current income tax liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits of 39 million as of january 2 2010 we had longterm income tax liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits of 3136 million for additional information on the income tax liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits see the discussion under the heading “contractual obligations” 

 

1375 convertible senior notes due december 2011 and 1500 convertible senior notes due december 2013 

 

in december 2006 we issued 2500 million principal amount of our 2011 notes and 2500 million of our 2013 notes concurrently with the issuance of the convertible senior notes we entered into hedge transactions with various parties and in separate transactions sold warrants to purchase our common stock to various parties to reduce the potential dilution from the conversion of the convertible senior notes and to mitigate any negative effect such conversion may have on the price of our common stock the 2011 notes mature on december 15 2011 and the 2013 notes mature on december 15 2013 and the principal amounts will be paid in cash at maturity for additional description of the convertible senior notes including the hedge and warrants transactions see note 3 to our consolidated financial statements 

 

contractual obligations 

 

a summary of our contractual obligations as of january 2 2010 is as follows 

 

 

 

 

 

  

 52 

 

with respect to purchase obligations that are cancelable by us the table includes the amount that would have been payable if we had canceled the obligation as of january 2 2010 or the earliest cancellation date 

 

in connection with our acquisitions completed before january 2 2010 we may be obligated to pay up to an aggregate of 159 million in cash during the next 32 months if certain defined performance goals are achieved in full 

 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

 

as of january 2 2010 we did not have any significant offbalance sheet arrangements as defined in item 303a4ii of sec regulation sk 

 

new accounting standards 

 

in october 2009 the fasb issued new accounting standards for multipledeliverable arrangements and for revenue arrangements that include both tangible products and software elements 

 

the new standards for multipledeliverable arrangements enable vendors to account for products or services deliverables separately rather than as a combined unit this guidance establishes a selling price hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable based on a vendorspecific objective evidence b thirdparty evidence or c estimates this guidance also eliminates the residual method of allocation and requires that arrangement consideration be allocated at the inception of the arrangement to all deliverables using the relative selling price method in addition this guidance significantly expands required disclosures related to a vendor’s multipledeliverable revenue arrangements 

 

under the new standards for revenue arrangements that include both tangible products and software elements tangible products containing software components and nonsoftware components that function together to deliver the tangible product’s essential functionality are excluded from the preexisting software revenue guidance in addition hardware components of a tangible product containing software components are always excluded from the preexisting software revenue guidance 

 

we are currently evaluating the application to our revenue arrangements of the two new accounting standards described above the impact of these new standards may result in revenue being recognized for certain sales of hardware and nonsoftwarerelated deliverables separate from the software deliverables within a multiple element arrangement both of these new standards are effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified during fiscal years beginning on or after june 15 2010 with the option to provide retrospective presentation for prior years with early adoption permitted we plan to adopt these two new accounting standards during our first quarter of fiscal 2011 

 

in june 2009 the fasb issued new accounting standards for determining whether to consolidate a variable interest entity these new standards amend the evaluation criteria to identify the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity and require ongoing reassessment of whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary of the variable interest entity the provisions of the new standards are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after november 15 2009 and interim periods within those fiscal years these standards will be effective for us beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2010 we are currently evaluating the impact that these new standards will have on our consolidated financial statements 

 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

 

foreign currency risk 

 

most of our revenue expenses and material business activity are transacted in the united states dollar however certain of our operations include transactions in foreign currencies and therefore we benefit from a weaker dollar and in certain countries where we invoice customers in the local currency we are adversely affected by a stronger dollar relative to major currencies worldwide the primary effect of foreign currency transactions on our results of operations from a weakening united states dollar is an increase in revenue offset by a smaller increase 

in expenses conversely the primary effect of foreign currency transactions on our results of operations from a strengthening united states dollar is a reduction in revenue offset by a smaller reduction in expenses 

 

we enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts with financial institutions to protect against currency exchange risks associated with existing assets and liabilities a foreign currency forward exchange contract acts as a hedge by increasing in value when underlying assets decrease in value or underlying liabilities increase in value due to changes in foreign exchange rates conversely a foreign currency forward exchange contract decreases in value when underlying assets increase in value or underlying liabilities decrease in value due to changes in foreign exchange rates these forward contracts are not designated as accounting hedges and therefore the unrealized gains and losses are recognized in other income net in advance of the actual foreign currency cash flows with the fair value of these forward contracts being recorded as accrued liabilities or other current assets 

 

our policy governing hedges of foreign currency risk does not allow us to use forward contracts for trading purposes our forward contracts generally have maturities of 90 days or less the effectiveness of our hedging program depends on our ability to estimate future asset and liability exposures we enter into currency forward exchange contracts based on estimated future asset and liability exposures recognized gains and losses with respect to our current hedging activities will ultimately depend on how accurately we are able to match the amount of currency forward exchange contracts with actual underlying asset and liability exposures 

 

the following table provides information as of january 2 2010 about our forward foreign currency contracts the information is provided in united states dollar equivalent amounts the table presents the notional amounts at contract exchange rates and the weighted average contractual foreign currency exchange rates expressed as units of the foreign currency per united states dollar which in some cases may not be the market convention for quoting a particular currency all of these forward contracts matured during january 2010 

 

 

 

while we actively monitor our foreign currency risks there can be no assurance that our foreign currency hedging activities will substantially offset the impact of fluctuations in currency exchange rates on our results of operations cash flows and financial position 

 

interest rate risk 

 

our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our portfolio of cash and cash equivalents while we are exposed to interest rate fluctuations in many of the world’s leading industrialized countries our interest income and expense is most sensitive to fluctuations in the general level of united states interest rates in this regard changes in united states interest rates affect the interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents and the costs associated with foreign currency hedges 

we invest in high quality credit issuers and by policy limit the amount of our credit exposure to any one issuer as part of our policy our first priority is to reduce the risk of principal loss consequently we seek to preserve our invested funds by limiting default risk market risk and reinvestment risk we mitigate default risk by investing in only high quality credit securities that we believe to have low credit risk and by positioning our portfolio to respond appropriately to a significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor the shortterm interestbearing portfolio of cash and cash equivalents includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity 

 

all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase are considered to be cash equivalents investments with maturities greater than three months are classified as availableforsale and are considered to be shortterm investments the carrying value of our interestbearing instruments approximated fair value as of january 2 2010 the following table presents the carrying value and related weighted average interest rates for our interestbearing instruments which are all classified as cash and cash equivalents on our consolidated balance sheet as of january 2 2010 

 

 

 

equity price risk 

 

1375 convertible senior notes due december 2011 and 1500 convertible senior notes due december 2013 

 

in december 2006 we issued 2500 million principal amount of our 2011 notes and 2500 million of our 2013 notes to three initial purchasers in a private placement pursuant to section 42 of the securities act for resale to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to sec rule 144a concurrently with the issuance of the convertible senior notes we entered into hedge transactions with various parties and in separate transactions sold warrants to various parties to reduce the potential dilution from the conversion of the convertible senior notes and to mitigate any negative effect such conversion may have on the price of our common stock for additional description of the convertible senior notes including the hedge and warrants transactions see note 3 to our consolidated financial statements 

 

investments 

 

we have a portfolio of equity investments that includes marketable equity securities and nonmarketable equity securities our equity investments are made primarily in connection with our strategic investment program under our strategic investment program from time to time we make cash investments in companies with technologies that are potentially strategically important to us see note 6 to our consolidated financial statements for additional details of these investments 

 




 item 9 changes in and disagreements with accountants on accounting and financial disclosure 

 

none 

 




 item 9a controls and procedures 

 

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

 

we carried out an evaluation required by rule 13a15 of the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended or the exchange act under the supervision and with the participation of our management including our chief executive officer or ceo and our chief financial officer or cfo of the effectiveness of the design and operation 

of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rules 1315e and 15d15e under the exchange act as of january 2 2010 

 

the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures included a review of our processes and the effect on the information generated for use in this annual report on form 10k in the course of this evaluation we sought to identify any material weaknesses in our disclosure controls and procedures to determine whether we had identified any acts of fraud involving personnel who have a significant role in our disclosure controls and procedures and to confirm that any necessary corrective action including process improvements was taken this type of evaluation is done every fiscal quarter so that our conclusions concerning the effectiveness of these controls can be reported in our periodic reports filed with the sec the overall goals of these evaluation activities are to monitor our disclosure controls and procedures and to make modifications as necessary we intend to maintain these disclosure controls and procedures modifying them as circumstances warrant 

 

based on their evaluation as of january 2 2010 our ceo and cfo have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by us in our reports filed or submitted under the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the sec’s rules and forms and is accumulated and communicated to our management including the ceo and cfo as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure 

 

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

 

there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended january 2 2010 that materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting 

 

inherent limitations on effectiveness of controls 

 

our management including our ceo and cfo does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all error and all fraud internal control over financial reporting no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of internal control are met further the design of internal control must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of the control must be considered relative to their costs while our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance of their effectiveness because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within cadence have been detected 

 

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rule 13a15f under the exchange act our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of january 2 2010 in making this assessment our management used the criteria established in internal controlintegrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission our management has concluded that as of january 2 2010 our internal control over financial reporting is effective based on these criteria our independent registered public accounting firm kpmg llp has issued an attestation report on our internal control over financial reporting which is included in item 15 “exhibits and financial statement schedules”

factors driving the electronic design automation industry 

 

during fiscal 2008 the semiconductor industry’s growth declined as the overall macroeconomic environment deteriorated most industry analysts estimate minimal growth for the semiconductor industry for 2008 and these industry analysts are forecasting a significant decline in semiconductor industry revenue for 2009 since consumer spending on electronics in 2008 was also negatively impacted by higher energy costs and increased unemployment and corporate spending was impacted by the tight credit market electronics companies faced financial challenges in fiscal 2008 and may continue to face such challenges in fiscal 2009 consistent with recent prior years 

semiconductor unit volumes grew during 2008 but average selling prices declined these factors combined with the current macroeconomic environment impact how electronics companies address the traditional challenges of cost quality innovation and timetomarket associated with highly complex electronics systems and ic product development electronics companies are currently requiring higher levels of productivity from their design teams better predictability in their development schedules and higher quality products in order to be competitive in the challenging and priceconscious markets they serve 

 

electronics companies respond to demand for increased functionality and miniaturization in markets that are affected by the current macroeconomic environment by combining subsystems — such as radio frequency or rf wireless communication video signal processing and microprocessors — onto a single silicon chip creating a systemonchip or soc or multiple chips into a single chip package in a format referred to as systeminpackage or sip these trends toward subsystem integration have required chip makers to find solutions to challenges previously addressed by system companies such as verifying systemlevel functionality and hardwaresoftware interoperability 

 

soc designs put many more transistors on each chip increasing the need for tight control over power consumption this is done not only to increase battery life in portable devices but also to minimize energy cost for computing and networking equipment higher power devices generate more heat which further increases both system cost as well as operating expenses for cooling evolving semiconductor manufacturing processes with smaller features transistors and wires and lower supply voltages address both of these issues to some degree but introduce new challenges of their own contemporary portable electronic devices contain chips in which individual features can be as small as 45 nanometers or 451000000ths of a millimeter because of the electrical characteristics of the materials used to construct the transistors which are essentially microscopic switches chips continue to consume power even when transistors in the device are switched off to overcome these and other powerrelated issues specific “low power” design techniques must be developed and are most effective if they are integrated throughout the design flow from logic design and verification through physical implementation 

 

variability in the processes and materials used to manufacture silicon chips have become so pervasive at 65 nanometers and below that traditional connections between design and manufacturing teams are insufficient to ensure chip performance and yield integrating detailed models of the manufacturing process into the chip design environment is desirable so engineers can craft a design to avoid or overcome these manufacturing process variations similarly manufacturing teams can optimize their processes if along with the design they are provided with information about the most critical parts of the chip however sharing information between design and manufacturing processes is complicated because current data formats used to describe the chip design differ from data formats used to describe the manufacturing process and control the manufacturing equipment moreover design and manufacturing most often involve two or more separate companies since multiple companies may participate in the design of the chip and in the manufacturing and assembly of the final device 

 

these trends represent significant new challenges for electronics design processes specifically product performance and size requirements of the mobile consumer electronics market require microelectronic systems to be smaller consume less power and provide multiple functions all in one soc or sip this requires designers to pay close attention to many electrical physical and manufacturing effects that were inconsequential in previous generations of chip designs the design challenge becomes more complex with each new generation of electronics and providers of eda solutions must deliver products that address these technical challenges while improving the productivity predictability and reliability of the design process

design for manufacturing 

 

with the advent of silicon manufacturing technologies at geometries of 65 nanometer and below our customers are increasingly concerned about manufacturability of their designs the physical layout of each ic requires detailed analysis and optimization to ensure that the design can be manufactured in volume while performing as expected our strategy is to integrate dfm awareness into our core design platforms of encounter digital ic and virtuoso custom ic 

 

some of our dfm capabilities include 

 

  

our primary focus in dfm is to address manufacturing effects as early in the product development process as possible as a result we are enhancing the dfm awareness of our core encounter digital ic and virtuoso custom ic product offerings where upstream integration is not possible cadence offers certain stand alone dfm products in connection with our cost savings initiatives that were implemented during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 we adjusted our roadmaps and investment consistent with our current dfm strategy the changes in our dfm strategy resulted in an impairment charge of 425 million arising from the abandonment and reduction to net realizable value of certain identifiable intangible assets 

 

third party programs and initiatives 

 

in addition to our products many customers use internallydeveloped design tools or design tools provided by other eda companies as well as ip available from multiple suppliers we support the use of thirdparty design products and ip through vehicles such as our connections ® program and through our participation in the openaccess coalition the power forward initiative and other programs and initiatives we also contribute to the development and deployment of eda industry standards

marketing and sales 

 

we generally market our products and provide maintenance and services to existing and prospective customers through a direct sales force consisting of sales people and applications engineers applications engineers provide technical presales and postsales support for software products due to the complexity of many of our eda products and the electronic design process the sales cycle is generally long requiring three to six months or more during the sales cycle our direct sales force generally provides technical presentations product demonstrations and support for onsite customer evaluation of our solutions we also use traditional marketing approaches to promote our products and services including advertising direct mail telemarketing trade shows public relations and the internet as eda products mature and become more widely understood by the marketplace we selectively utilize value added resellers to broaden our reach and reduce cost of sales all orcad and selected incisive products are primarily marketed through these channels with respect to international sales we generally market and support our 

products and services through our subsidiaries we also use a thirdparty distributor to sell our products and services to certain customers in japan 

 

software licensing arrangements 

 

we sell software using three license types subscription term and perpetual customers who prefer to license technology for a specified limited period of time will choose either a subscription or term license and customers who prefer to have the right to use the technology continuously without time restriction will choose a perpetual license customers who desire to use new technology during the life of the contract will select a subscription license which allows them limited access to unspecified new technology on a whenandifavailable basis as opposed to a term or perpetual license which does not include rights to use new technology payment terms for subscription and term licenses generally provide for payments to be made in installments over the license period and payment terms for perpetual licenses generally are net 30 days 

 

we offer a delivery mechanism for term and subscription licenses called eda cards eda cards have an overall “face” value amount that customers draw down against as they select specific products that are priced based on the particular duration of use the customer desires the selection and licensing of the specific products is accomplished through an automated online system the card expires when all of the face value is consumed or on the predetermined expiration date whichever comes first there are two types of eda cards an eda gold card is a term license that enables a customer to access a predetermined list of existing products an eda platinum card is a subscription license that enables a customer to access existing and new technology 

 

our revenue recognition depends on a number of contractspecific terms and conditions including the license type payment terms creditworthiness of the customer and other factors for additional description of our revenue recognition see the discussion under the heading “critical accounting estimates” under item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” below revenue associated with subscription licenses is recognized over multiple periods during the license term whereas product revenue associated with term and perpetual licenses is generally recognized upon the later of the effective date of the license or delivery of the product assuming all other criteria for revenue recognition have been met the amount of product revenue recognized from backlog varies from quarter to quarter the amount of product revenue recognized from backlog as compared to total product revenue was more than half during fiscal 2008 and approximately twothirds during both fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006 we are moving to a license mix that will result in increased ratable revenue and we expect the percentage of product revenue from backlog to increase in future years 

 

our revenue and results of operations may miss expectations due to a shortfall in product revenue generated from current transactions or variance in the actual mix of license types executed in any given period and due to other contractspecific terms and conditions as discussed above we are subject to greater credit risk on subscription and term licenses as compared to perpetual licenses because of the installment payment terms generally associated with those license types 

 

from time to time we sell receivables generated by our licenses with installment payment terms to thirdparty financial institutions on a nonrecourse or limitedrecourse basis 

 

for a further description of our license agreements revenue recognition policies and results of operations please refer to the discussion under the heading “critical accounting estimates” under item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” below 

 

research and development 

 

our investment in research and development was 4579 million during fiscal 2008 4940 million during fiscal 2007 and 4601 million during fiscal 2006 

 

the primary areas of our research and development include soc design the design of silicon devices in the nanometer range highperformance ic packaging sip and pcb design systemlevel modeling and verification highperformance logic verification technology and hardwaresoftware coverification the electronics industry combines rapid innovation with rapidly increasing design and manufacturing complexity so we make significant 

investments in enhancing our current products as well as creating new products and technologies and integrating those products and technologies together into segmented solutions 

 

our future performance depends largely on our ability to maintain and enhance our current product development and commercialization to develop acquire or operate with new products from third parties and to develop solutions that meet increasingly demanding productivity quality predictability and cost requirements 

 

manufacturing and distribution 

 

our software production consists of configuring the customer’s order recording the product electronically or on cdrom and producing unique access keys that allow customers to use licensed products software and documentation are primarily distributed to customers by secure electronic delivery user manuals and other documentation are generally available by secure electronic delivery or on cdrom but are occasionally supplied in hard copy format 

 

we perform final assembly and test our hardware verification acceleration and emulation products at our headquarters in san jose california subcontractors manufacture all major subassemblies including all individual pcbs and custom ics and supply them for qualification and testing before their incorporation into the assembled product 

 

proprietary technology 

 

our success depends in part upon our proprietary technology we generally rely on patents copyrights trademarks and trade secret laws licenses and restrictive agreements to establish and protect our proprietary rights in technology and products many of our products include software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties we may have to seek new licenses or renew existing licenses for third party software and other intellectual property in the future as part of performing engineering services for customers our engineering services business uses certain software and other intellectual property licensed from third parties including that of our competitors 

 

competition 

 

we compete in the eda market for products and maintenance primarily with three companies synopsys inc mentor graphics corporation and magma design automation inc we also compete with numerous smaller eda companies with manufacturers of electronic devices that have developed or have the capability to develop their own eda products and with numerous electronics design and consulting companies we generally compete on the basis of product quality product features level of integration or compatibility with other tools price payment terms and maintenance offerings 

 

our maintenance business flows directly from our product business the competitive issues associated with our maintenance business are substantially similar to those for our product business in that every maintenance contract is the direct result of a product contract and once we have entered into a product contract maintenance is generally purchased by the customer to ensure access to bug fixes and service releases as and when they are made available and other continued support 

 

certain competitive factors in the engineering services business as described herein differ from those of the products and maintenance businesses while we do compete with other eda companies in the engineering services business our principal competitors are independent engineering service businesses these companies vary greatly in focus geographic location capability cost structure and pricing in addition manufacturers of electronic devices may be reluctant to purchase services from independent vendors including us because they wish to promote their own internal design departments we compete with these companies by focusing on the design of complex analog and digital ics it is our strategy to use engineering services as a differentiator to further promote our products and maintenance businesses 

backlog 

 

our backlog as of january 3 2009 was approximately 18 billion as compared to approximately 20 billion as of december 29 2007 backlog consists of revenue to be recognized in future fiscal periods after january 3 2009 from a variety of license types which generally include but are not limited to 

 

  

the substantial majority of our backlog is generated by our product and maintenance businesses because customer licenses generally include both product and maintenance components historically we have not experienced significant cancellations of our contracts with customers however we occasionally reschedule the required completion dates of engineering services contracts which may defer revenue recognition under those contracts beyond the original expected completion date changes in customer license types or payment terms also can impact the timing of revenue recognition 

 

the challenges currently affecting the economy of the united states and other regions of the world have impacted our customers who are concentrated in the semiconductor sector and may cause them to delay or default on their payment obligations file for bankruptcy or modify or cancel plans to license our products we have not yet experienced a material level of defaults by customers of payment obligations but any material payment default by our customers or significant reductions in existing contractual commitments could adversely impact our financial condition and operating results 

 

revenue seasonality 

 

historically orders and revenue have been lowest in our first quarter and highest in our fourth quarter with a material decline between the fourth quarter of one year and the first quarter of the following year due to the current economic environment and our previously announced transition to a primarily ratable license mix we did not see the trend of higher orders and revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 and there can be no assurance we will experience it in the future we still expect the first quarter to remain our lowest quarter for orders and revenue 

 

international operations 

 

we have approximately 55 sales offices design centers and research and development facilities approximately half of which are located outside of the united states we consider customer sales and support requirements the availability of a skilled workforce and costs and efficiencies among other relative benefits when determining what operations to locate internationally for additional information regarding our international operations see the discussion under the heading “the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations and other risks to our international operations may seriously harm our financial condition” under item 1a “risk factors” and note 21 to our consolidated financial statements 

 

employees 

 

as of january 3 2009 we employed approximately 4900 individuals with approximately 1800 in sales services marketing support and manufacturing activities approximately 2400 in product research and development and approximately 700 in management administration and finance during fiscal 2008 we initiated a restructuring plan to decrease costs by reducing our workforce across the company this restructuring plan is expected to reduce our workforce by at least 625 positions approximately 300 of the affected employees were still employed by us as of january 3 2009 due to regulatory requirements in certain jurisdictions in which we operate for additional description of our restructuring plan see the discussion under the heading “results of operations — restructuring and other charges” under item 7 “management’s discussion and 

analysis of financial condition and results of operations” below none of our employees is represented by a labor union and we have experienced no work stoppages we believe that our employee relations are good

 item 1a risk factors 

 

our business faces many risks described below are what we believe to be the material risks that we face if any of the events or circumstances described in the following risks actually occurs our business financial condition or results of operations could suffer 

 

risks related to our business 

 

we are subject to the cyclical nature of the integrated circuit and electronics systems industries and any downturn in these industries may reduce our revenue 

 

purchases of our products and services are dependent upon the commencement of new design projects by ic manufacturers and electronics systems companies the ic and electronics systems industries are cyclical and are characterized by constant and rapid technological change rapid product obsolescence and price erosion evolving standards short product life cycles and wide fluctuations in product supply and demand 

 

the ic and electronics systems industries experienced significant challenges in 2008 and may continue to face challenges in 2009 as a result of a decline in the macroeconomic environment the ic and electronic systems industries also from time to time experience downturns in connection with or in anticipation of maturing product cycles of both these industries’ and their customers’ products as in the past the current economic downturn is characterized by diminished product demand production overcapacity high inventory levels and accelerated erosion of average selling prices the current economic downturn in the industries we serve has contributed to the substantial reduction in our revenue and could continue to harm our business operating results and financial condition 

 

our failure to respond quickly to technological developments could make our products uncompetitive and obsolete 

 

the industries in which we compete experience rapid technology developments changes in industry standards changes in customer requirements and frequent new product introductions and improvements currently the industries we serve are experiencing the following trends 

 

 14 

  

if we are unable to respond quickly and successfully to these trends we may lose our competitive position and our products or technologies may become uncompetitive or obsolete to compete successfully we must develop or acquire new products and improve our existing products and processes on a schedule that keeps pace with technological developments and the requirements for products addressing a broad spectrum of designers and designer expertise in our industries we must also be able to support a range of changing computer software hardware platforms and customer preferences we cannot guarantee that we will be successful in this effort 

 

we have experienced varied operating results and our operating results for any particular fiscal period are affected by the timing of significant orders for our software products fluctuations in customer preferences for license types and the timing of revenue recognition under those license types 

 

we have experienced and may continue to experience varied operating results in particular we experienced a net loss during fiscal 2008 and we expect to experience a net loss during fiscal 2009 various factors affect our operating results and some of them are not within our control our operating results for any period are affected by the timing of significant orders for our software products because a significant number of licenses for our software products are in excess of 50 million 

 

our operating results are also affected by the mix of license types executed in any given period we license software using three different license types subscription term and perpetual product revenue associated with term and perpetual licenses is generally recognized at the beginning of the license period whereas product revenue associated with subscription licenses is recognized over multiple periods during the term of the license revenue may also be deferred under term and perpetual licenses until payments become due and payable from customers with nonlinear payment terms or as cash is collected from customers with lower credit ratings in addition revenue is impacted by the timing of license renewals the extent to which contracts contain flexible payment terms changes in existing contractual arrangements with customers and the mix of license types ie perpetual term or subscription for existing customers which changes could have the effect of accelerating or delaying the recognition of revenue from the timing of recognition under the original contract our license mix has changed such that a higher proportion of licenses require ratable revenue recognition and we expect the change in our license mix combined with the difficult economic environment will result in a decrease in our revenue for fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 

 

we plan operating expense levels primarily based on forecasted revenue levels these expenses and the impact of longterm commitments are relatively fixed in the short term in addition revenue levels are harder to forecast in a difficult economic environment a shortfall in revenue could lead to operating results below expectations because we may not be able to quickly reduce these fixed expenses in response to these shortterm business changes 

 

the majority of our contracts are executed in the final few weeks of a fiscal quarter this makes it difficult to determine with accuracy how much business will be executed in each fiscal quarter due to the volume or complexity of transactions that we review at the very end of the quarter or due to operational matters regarding particular agreements we may not finish processing or ship products under some contracts that have been signed during that fiscal quarter which means that the associated revenue cannot be recognized in that particular period 

 

you should not view our historical results of operations as reliable indicators of our future performance if our revenue operating results or business outlook for future periods fall short of the levels expected by securities analysts or investors the trading price of our common stock could decline 

our stock price has been subject to fluctuations and has experienced a significant decline and may continue to be subject to fluctuations and decline 

 

the market price of our common stock has recently experienced significant fluctuations and may continue to fluctuate in the future and as a result you could lose the value of your investment the market price of our common stock may be affected by a number of factors such as 

 

  

in addition equity markets in general have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations and the market prices of many technology companies have decreased substantially particularly electronic systems and semiconductor companies such price and volume fluctuations may continue to adversely affect the market price of our common stock for reasons unrelated to our business or operating results 

 

litigation could adversely affect our financial condition or operations 

 

we are currently and in the future may be involved in various disputes and litigation that arise in the ordinary course of business these include disputes and lawsuits related to intellectual property mergers and acquisitions licensing contracts distribution arrangements and employee relations matters we are also currently engaged in several securities class actions and derivative lawsuits for information regarding the litigation matters in which we are currently engaged please refer to the discussion under item 3 “legal proceedings” we cannot provide any assurances that the final outcome of these lawsuits or any other proceedings that may arise in the future will not have a material adverse effect on our business operating results or financial condition litigation can be timeconsuming and expensive and could divert management’s time and attention from our business which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and operating results the adverse resolution of any specific lawsuit or proceeding could also have a material adverse effect on our business operating results financial condition and cash flows 

 

matters relating to or arising from our recent restatement and weaknesses in our internal controls could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

 

in connection with the restatement of our previously issued financial statements for the periods ended march 29 2008 and june 28 2008 and our reassessment of our disclosure controls and procedures under item 307 of regulation sk management concluded that as of march 29 2008 june 28 2008 and september 27 2008 our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective and that we had a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting please refer to the discussion under item 9a “controls and procedures” for further discussion of the remediation of this material weakness as of january 3 2009 should we identify any other material weakness and be unable to remediate any such other material weakness promptly and effectively such weakness could harm our operating results result in a material misstatement of our financial statements cause us to fail to meet our financial reporting obligations or prevent us from providing reliable and accurate financial reports or avoiding or detecting fraud this in turn could result in a loss of investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports which could have an adverse effect on our stock price any litigation or other proceeding or adverse publicity relating to our remediated material weakness or any future material weakness could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results 

our operating results and revenue could be adversely affected by customer payment delays customer bankruptcies and defaults or modifications of licenses or supplier modifications in response to the economic environment 

 

as a result of challenges currently affecting the economy of the united states and other regions of the world our customers who are concentrated in the semiconductor sector have experienced and may continue to experience adverse changes in their business and as a result may delay or default on their payment obligations file for bankruptcy or modify or cancel plans to license our products and our suppliers may significantly and quickly increase their prices or reduce their output if our customers are not successful in generating sufficient revenue or are precluded from securing financing they may not be able to pay or may delay payment of accounts receivable that are owed to us although these obligations are generally not cancelable our customers’ inability to fulfill payment obligations may adversely affect our revenue and cash flow additionally our customers may seek to renegotiate preexisting contractual commitments though we have not yet experienced a material level of defaults any material payment default by our customers or significant reductions in existing contractual commitments would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results because of the escalating challenges in the global capital markets and financial institutions including a tightening in the capital and credit markets if we were to seek funding from the capital or credit markets in response to any material level of customer defaults we may not be able to secure funding on terms acceptable to us or at all 

 

our future revenue is dependent in part upon our installed customer base continuing to license or buy additional products renew maintenance agreements and purchase additional services 

 

our installed customer base has traditionally generated additional new license service and maintenance revenues in future periods customers may not necessarily license or buy additional products or contract for additional services or maintenance maintenance is generally renewable annually at a customer’s option and there are no mandatory payment obligations or obligations to license additional software if our customers decide not to renew their maintenance agreements or license additional products or contract for additional services or if they reduce the scope of the maintenance agreements our revenue could decrease which could have an adverse effect on our operating results our customers which include large semiconductor companies often have significant bargaining power in negotiations with us mergers or acquisitions of our customers can reduce the total level of purchases of our software and services and in some cases increase customers’ bargaining power in negotiations with their suppliers including us 

 

we depend upon our management team and key employees and our management changes or our failure to attract train motivate and retain management and key employees may make us less competitive in our industries and therefore harm our results of operations 

 

our business depends upon the efforts and abilities of our executive officers and other key employees including key development personnel from time to time there may be changes in our management team resulting from the hiring and departure of executive officers on october 15 2008 we announced the resignations of our president and chief executive officer executive vice president and chief administrative officer executive vice president — worldwide field operations executive vice president — products and technologies organization and executive vice president — corporate affairs on january 8 2009 we announced that lipbu tan was appointed our new president and chief executive officer as we undergo this transition we may experience disruption to our business that may harm our operating results and our relationships with our employees customers and suppliers may be adversely affected in addition our competitors may seek to use this transition and the related potential disruptions to gain a competitive advantage over us 

 

competition for highly skilled executive officers and employees can be intense particularly in geographic areas recognized as high technology centers such as the silicon valley area where our principal offices are located and the other locations where we maintain facilities to attract retain and motivate individuals with the requisite expertise we may be required to grant large numbers of stock options or other stockbased incentive awards which may be dilutive to existing stockholders and increase compensation expense and pay significant base salaries and cash bonuses which could harm our operating results the high cost of training new employees not fully utilizing 

these employees or losing trained employees to competing employers could also reduce our gross margins and harm our business or operating results 

 

in addition the nasdaq marketplace rules require stockholder approval for new equity compensation plans and significant amendments to existing plans including increases in shares available for issuance under such plans and prohibit nasdaq member organizations from giving a proxy to vote on equity compensation plans unless the beneficial owner of the shares has given voting instructions these regulations could make it more difficult for us to grant equity compensation to employees in the future to the extent that these regulations make it more difficult or expensive to grant equity compensation to employees we may incur increased compensation costs or find it difficult to attract retain and motivate employees which could materially and adversely affect our business 

 

we may not be able to effectively implement our restructuring plans and our restructuring plans may not result in the expected benefits which would negatively impact our future results of operations 

 

during fiscal 2008 we initiated a restructuring plan in an effort to align our cost structure with expected revenue this restructuring plan is intended to decrease costs throughout our company we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully complete and realize the expected benefits of our restructuring plan such as improvements in operating margins and cash flows in the restructuring periods contemplated the restructuring plan may involve higher costs or a longer timetable than we currently anticipate or it may fail to improve our results of operations as we anticipate our inability to realize these benefits may result in an inefficient business structure that could negatively impact our results of operations we also expect our restructuring plan to cause us to incur substantial costs related to severance and other employeerelated costs our restructuring plan may also subject us to litigation risks and expenses in addition our restructuring plan may have other consequences such as attrition beyond our planned reduction in workforce or a negative impact on employee morale and our competitors may seek to gain a competitive advantage over us together with our changes in management the restructuring plan could also cause our remaining employees to leave or result in reduced productivity by our remaining employees which in turn may affect our revenue and other operating results in the future 

 

we may not receive significant revenue from our current research and development efforts for several years if at all 

 

developing eda technology and integrating acquired technology into existing platforms is expensive and these investments often require a long time to generate returns our strategy involves significant investments in research and development and related product opportunities we believe that we must continue to dedicate a significant amount of resources to our research and development efforts in order to maintain our competitive position however we cannot predict that we will receive significant if any revenue from these investments 

 

the competition in our industries is substantial and we may not be able to continue to successfully compete in our industries 

 

the eda market and the commercial electronics engineering services industries are highly competitive if we fail to compete successfully in these industries it could seriously harm our business operating results or financial condition to compete in these industries we must identify and develop or acquire innovative and costcompetitive eda products integrate them into platforms and market them in a timely manner we must also gain industry acceptance for our engineering services and offer better strategic concepts technical solutions prices and response time or a combination of these factors than those of other design companies and the internal design departments of electronics manufacturers we cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully in these industries factors that could affect our ability to succeed include 

 

 18 

  

we compete in the eda products market with synopsys inc magma design automation inc and mentor graphics corporation we also compete with numerous smaller eda companies with manufacturers of electronic devices that have developed or have the capability to develop their own eda products and with numerous electronics design and consulting companies manufacturers of electronic devices may be reluctant to purchase engineering services from independent vendors such as us because they wish to promote their own internal design departments 

 

we may need to change our pricing models to compete successfully 

 

the highly competitive markets in which we compete can put pressure on us to reduce the prices of our products if our competitors offer deep discounts on certain products in an effort to recapture or gain market segment share or to sell other software or hardware products we may then need to lower our prices or offer other favorable terms to compete successfully any such changes would be likely to reduce our profit margins and could adversely affect our operating results any substantial changes to our prices and pricing policies could cause sales and software license revenues to decline or be delayed as our sales force implements and our customers adjust to the new pricing policies some of our competitors may bundle products for promotional purposes or as a longterm pricing strategy or provide guarantees of prices and product implementations these practices could over time significantly constrain the prices that we can charge for our products if we cannot offset price reductions with a corresponding increase in the number of sales or with lower spending then the reduced license revenues resulting from lower prices could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

 

we have acquired and expect to acquire other companies and businesses and may not realize the expected benefits of these acquisitions 

 

we have acquired and expect to acquire other companies and businesses in the future while we expect to carefully analyze each potential acquisition before committing to the transaction we may not consummate any particular transaction which can nevertheless result in significant costs or if a transaction is consummated we may not be able to integrate and manage acquired products and businesses effectively in addition acquisitions involve a number of risks if any of the following events occurs after we acquire another business it could seriously harm our business operating results or financial condition 

 

 19 

 

in a number of our previously completed acquisitions we have agreed to make future payments either in the form of employee bonuses or contingent purchase price payments or earnouts based on the performance of the acquired businesses or the employees who joined us with the acquired businesses the performance goals pursuant to which these future payments may be made generally relate to achievement by the acquired business or the employees who joined us with the acquired business of certain specified bookings revenue run rate product proliferation product development or employee retention goals during a specified period following completion of the applicable acquisition future acquisitions may involve issuances of stock as full or partial payment of the purchase price for the acquired business grants of incentive stock or options to employees of the acquired businesses which may be dilutive to existing stockholders expenditure of substantial cash resources or the incurrence of material amounts of debt 

 

the specific performance goal levels and amounts and timing of employee bonuses or contingent purchase price payments vary with each acquisition while we expect to derive value from an acquisition in excess of such contingent payment obligations our strategy may change and we may be required to make certain contingent payments without deriving the anticipated value in connection with our acquisitions completed before january 3 2009 we may be obligated to pay up to an aggregate of 510 million in cash during the next 44 months if certain defined performance goals are achieved in full which would be expensed as compensation expense in our consolidated statements of operations 

 

in december 2007 the financial accounting standards board or fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard or sfas no 141r “business combinations” which will change how business acquisitions are accounted for and will impact financial statements both on the acquisition date and in subsequent periods sfas no 141r is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2008 early adoption is not permitted we are currently evaluating the impact that sfas no 141r will have on our consolidated financial statements 

 

we rely on our proprietary technology as well as software and other intellectual property rights licensed to us by third parties and we cannot assure you that the precautions taken to protect our rights will be adequate or that we will continue to be able to adequately secure such intellectual property rights from third parties 

 

our success depends in part upon our proprietary technology we generally rely on patents copyrights trademarks trade secret laws licenses and restrictive agreements to establish and protect our proprietary rights in technology and products despite precautions we may take to protect our intellectual property third parties have tried in the past and may try in the future to challenge invalidate or circumvent these safeguards the rights granted under our patents or attendant to our other intellectual property may not provide us with any competitive advantages and there is no guarantee that patents will be issued on any of our pending applications and future patents may not be sufficiently broad to protect our technology furthermore the laws of foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights in those countries to the same extent as applicable law protects these rights in the united states the protection of our intellectual property may require the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources litigation can be timeconsuming and expensive and could divert management’s time and attention from our business which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and operating results moreover the steps we take to protect our intellectual property may not adequately protect our rights or prevent third parties from infringing or misappropriating our proprietary rights many of our products include software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties we may have to seek new or renew existing licenses for such software and other intellectual property in the future our engineering services business holds licenses to certain software and other intellectual property owned by third parties including that of our competitors our failure to obtain software or other intellectual property licenses or other intellectual property rights that is necessary or helpful for our business on favorable terms or the need to engage in litigation over these licenses or rights could seriously harm our business operating results or financial condition 

we could lose key technology or suffer serious harm to our business because of the infringement of our intellectual property rights by third parties or because of our infringement of the intellectual property rights of third parties 

 

there are numerous patents in the eda industry and new patents are being issued at a rapid rate it is not always practicable to determine in advance whether a product or any of its components infringes the patent rights of others as a result from time to time we may be compelled to respond to or prosecute intellectual property infringement claims to protect our rights or defend a customer’s rights 

 

intellectual property infringement claims regardless of merit could consume valuable management time result in costly litigation or cause product shipment delays all of which could seriously harm our business operating results or financial condition in settling these claims we may be required to enter into royalty or licensing agreements with the third parties claiming infringement these royalty or licensing agreements if available may not have terms favorable to us being compelled to enter into a license agreement with unfavorable terms could seriously harm our business operating results or financial condition any potential intellectual property litigation could compel us to do one or more of the following 

 

  

if we were compelled to take any of these actions our business or operating results may suffer 

 

if our security measures are breached and an unauthorized party obtains access to customer data our information systems may be perceived as being unsecure and customers may curtail or stop their use of our products and services 

 

our products and services involve the storage and transmission of customers’ proprietary information and breaches of our security measures could expose us to a risk of loss or misuse of this information litigation and potential liability because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage information systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventive measures if an actual or perceived breach of our security occurs the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed and we could lose existing customers and our ability to obtain new customers 

 

the long sales cycle of our products and services makes the timing of our revenue difficult to predict and may cause our operating results to fluctuate unexpectedly 

 

generally we have a long sales cycle that can extend up to six months or longer the length of the sales cycle may cause our revenue or operating results to vary from quarter to quarter the complexity and expense associated with our business generally require a lengthy customer education evaluation and approval process consequently we may incur substantial expenses and devote significant management effort and expense to develop potential relationships that do not result in agreements or revenue and may prevent us from pursuing other opportunities 

 

in addition sales of our products and services have been and may in the future be delayed if customers delay approval or commencement of projects because of 

 

  

long sales cycles for acceleration and emulation hardware products subject us to a number of significant risks over which we have limited control including insufficient excess or obsolete inventory variations in inventory valuation and fluctuations in quarterly operating results 

the majority of our contracts are executed in the final few weeks of a fiscal quarter this makes it difficult to determine with accuracy how much business will be executed in each fiscal quarter also because of the timing of large orders and our customers’ buying patterns we may not learn of bookings shortfalls revenue shortfalls earnings shortfalls or other failures to meet market expectations until late in a fiscal quarter these factors may cause our operating results to fluctuate unexpectedly which can cause significant fluctuations in the trading price of our common stock 

 

we may not be able to sell certain installment contracts to generate cash which may impact our operating cash flows for any particular fiscal period 

 

we sell certain installment contracts to certain financial institutions on a nonrecourse or limitedrecourse basis to generate cash our ability to complete these sales of installment contracts is affected by a number of factors including the 

 

  

disruptions in the financial markets have and may continue to adversely impact the availability and cost of financing transactions for the installment contract sales that we have already arranged or may arrange as a result of the credit losses recorded by banks during 2008 and the current financial challenges experienced by banks a number of banks have become less willing to purchase assets because of capital constraints and concerns about overexposure to the technology sector in addition the change in our license mix will result in an increased number of subscription licenses and a decrease in the sale of receivables to financial institutions so we expect a reduced level of proceeds from the sale of receivables throughout fiscal 2009 if we are unable to sell certain installment contracts our operating cash flows would be adversely affected there can be no assurance that funding will be available to us or if available that it will be on terms acceptable to us if sources of funding are not available to us on a regular basis for any reason including the occurrence of events of default deterioration in credit quality in the underlying pool of receivables or otherwise it would have a material adverse effect on our operating cash flows 

 

the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations and other risks to our international operations may seriously harm our financial condition 

 

we have significant operations outside the united states our revenue from international operations as a percentage of total revenue was approximately 58 during fiscal 2008 54 during fiscal 2007 and 48 during fiscal 2006 we expect that revenue from our international operations will continue to account for a significant portion of our total revenue we also transact business in various foreign currencies primarily the japanese yen the volatility of foreign currencies in certain regions most notably the japanese yen european union euro british pound and indian rupee have had and may in the future have a harmful effect on our revenue or operating results 

 

fluctuations in the rate of exchange between the united states dollar and the currencies of other countries in which we conduct business could seriously harm our business operating results or financial condition for example when a foreign currency declines in value relative to the united states dollar it takes more of the foreign currency to purchase the same amount of united states dollars than before the change if we price our products and services in the foreign currency we receive fewer united states dollars than we did before the change if we price our products and services in united states dollars the decrease in value of the local currency results in an increase in the price for our products and services compared to those products of our competitors that are priced in local currency this could result in our prices being uncompetitive in markets where business is transacted in the local currency on the other hand when a foreign currency increases in value relative to the united states dollar it takes more united states dollars to purchase the same amount of the foreign currency as we use the foreign currency to pay for payroll costs and other operating expenses in our international operations this results in an increase in operating expenses 

 

exposure to foreign currency transaction risk can arise when transactions are conducted in a currency different from the functional currency of one of our subsidiaries a subsidiary’s functional currency is generally the currency in which it primarily conducts its operations including product pricing expenses and borrowings although we 

attempt to reduce the impact of foreign currency fluctuations significant exchange rate movements may hurt our results of operations as expressed in united states dollars 

 

our international operations may also be subject to other risks including 

 

  

we have offices throughout the world including key research and development facilities outside of the united states our operations are dependent upon the connectivity of our operations throughout the world activities that interfere with our international connectivity such as computer hacking or the introduction of a virus into our computer systems could significantly interfere with our business operations 

 

our operating results could be adversely affected as a result of changes in our effective tax rates 

 

our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by the following 

 

  

any significant change in our future effective tax rates could adversely impact our results of operations for future periods 

 

we have received an examination report from the irs proposing deficiencies in certain of our tax returns and the outcome of current and future tax examinations may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows 

 

the irs and other tax authorities regularly examine our income tax returns in july 2006 the irs completed its field examination of our federal income tax returns for the tax years 2000 through 2002 and issued a revenue agents report or rar in which the irs proposed to assess an aggregate tax deficiency for the threeyear period of approximately 3240 million in november 2006 the irs revised the proposed aggregate tax deficiency for the threeyear period to be approximately 3180 million the irs is contesting our qualification for deferred recognition of certain proceeds received from restitution and settlement in connection with litigation during the period the proposed tax deficiency for this item is approximately 1520 million the remaining proposed tax deficiency of approximately 1660 million is primarily related to proposed adjustments to our transfer pricing 

arrangements with foreign subsidiaries and to our deductions for foreign trade income the irs may make similar claims against our transfer pricing arrangements and deductions for foreign trade income in future examinations we have filed a timely protest with the irs and are seeking resolution of the issues through the appeals office of the irs or the appeals office 

 

we believe that the proposed irs adjustments are inconsistent with applicable tax laws and we are vigorously challenging these proposed adjustments the rar is not a final statutory notice of deficiency but the irs imposes interest on the proposed deficiencies until the matters are resolved interest is compounded daily at rates published and adjusted quarterly by the irs and have been between 4 and 10 since 2001 the irs is currently examining our federal income tax returns for the tax years 2003 through 2005 

 

significant judgment is required in applying the principles of fasb interpretation or fin no 48 “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes — an interpretation of fasb statement no 109” and sfas no 109 “accounting for income taxes” the calculation of our provision for income taxes involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes we regularly assess the potential settlement outcomes resulting from income tax examinations however the final outcome of tax examinations including the total amount payable or the timing of any such payments upon resolution of these issues cannot be estimated with certainty in addition we cannot be certain that such amount will not be materially different than that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals should the irs or other tax authorities assess additional taxes as a result of a current or a future examination we may be required to record charges to operations in future periods that could have a material impact on the results of operations financial position or cash flows in the applicable period or periods 

 

forecasting our estimated annual effective tax rate is complex and subject to uncertainty and material differences between forecasted and actual tax rates could have a material impact on our results of operations 

 

forecasts of our income tax position and resultant effective tax rate are complex and subject to uncertainty because our income tax position for each year combines the effects of estimating our annual income or loss the mix of profits and losses earned by us and our subsidiaries in tax jurisdictions with a broad range of income tax rates as well as benefits from available deferred tax assets the impact of various accounting rules and changes to these rules and results of tax audits to forecast our global tax rate pretax profits and losses by jurisdiction are estimated and tax expense by jurisdiction is calculated if our estimate of the pretax profit and losses the mix of our profits and losses our ability to use deferred tax assets the results of tax audits or effective tax rates by jurisdiction is different than those estimates our actual tax rate could be materially different than forecasted which could have a material impact on our results of operations 

 

failure to obtain export licenses could harm our business by rendering us unable to ship products and transfer our technology outside of the united states 

 

we must comply with regulations of the united states and of certain other countries in shipping our software products and transferring our technology outside the united states and to foreign nationals although we have not had any significant difficulty complying with such regulations so far any significant future difficulty in complying could harm our business operating results or financial condition 

 

errors or defects in our products and services could expose us to liability and harm our reputation 

 

our customers use our products and services in designing and developing products that involve a high degree of technological complexity each of which has its own specifications because of the complexity of the systems and products with which we work some of our products and designs can be adequately tested only when put to full use in the marketplace as a result our customers or their end users may discover errors or defects in our software or the systems we design or the products or systems incorporating our design and intellectual property may not operate as expected errors or defects could result in 

 

 24 

  

if we become subject to unfair hiring claims we could be prevented from hiring needed employees incur liability for damages and incur substantial costs in defending ourselves 

 

companies in our industry whose employees accept positions with competitors frequently claim that these competitors have engaged in unfair hiring practices or that the employment of these persons would involve the disclosure or use of trade secrets these claims could prevent us from hiring employees or cause us to incur liability for damages we could also incur substantial costs in defending ourselves or our employees against these claims regardless of their merits defending ourselves from these claims could also divert the attention of our management away from our operations 

 

our business is subject to the risk of earthquakes 

 

our corporate headquarters including certain of our research and development operations and certain of our distribution facilities is located in the silicon valley area of northern california which is a region known to experience seismic activity if significant seismic activity were to occur our operations may be interrupted which would adversely impact our business and results of operations 

 

we maintain research and development and other facilities in parts of the world that are not as politically stable as the united states and as a result we may face a higher risk of business interruption from acts of war or terrorism than businesses located only or primarily in the united states 

 

we maintain international research and development and other facilities some of which are in parts of the world that are not as politically stable as the united states consequently we may face a greater risk of business interruption as a result of terrorist acts or military conflicts than businesses located domestically furthermore this potential harm is exacerbated given that damage to or disruptions at our international research and development facilities could have an adverse effect on our ability to develop new or improve existing products as compared to other businesses which may only have sales offices or other less critical operations abroad we are not insured for losses or interruptions caused by acts of war or terrorism 

 

risks related to our securities and indebtedness 

 

our debt obligations expose us to risks that could adversely affect our business operating results or financial condition and could prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under such indebtedness 

 

we have a substantial level of debt as of january 3 2009 we had 5002 million of outstanding indebtedness as follows 

 

  

the level of our current or future indebtedness among other things could 

 

 25 

  

while we are not currently a party to any loans that would prohibit us from making payment on our outstanding convertible notes we are not prevented by the terms of the convertible notes from entering into other loans that could prohibit such payments if we are prohibited from paying our outstanding indebtedness we could try to obtain the consent of the lenders under those arrangements to make such payment or we could attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain the restrictions if we do not obtain the necessary consents or refinance the borrowings we may be unable to satisfy our outstanding indebtedness any such failure would constitute an event of default under our indebtedness which could in turn constitute a default under the terms of any other indebtedness then outstanding 

 

if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow or otherwise obtain funds necessary to make required payments or if we fail to comply with the various requirements of our indebtedness we would be in default which would permit the holders of our indebtedness to accelerate the maturity of the indebtedness and could cause defaults under any other indebtedness as well 

 

we have in the past and may in the future attempt to access the capital or credit markets in order to obtain funding to meet particular liquidity needs because of the escalating challenges in the global capital markets and financial institutions including a tightening in the capital and credit markets compounded by the increasingly challenging and priceconscious economic environment and our lower levels of business we may not be able to secure additional funding on terms acceptable to us or at all which could adversely impact our business and operating results 

 

any default under our indebtedness could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition in addition a material default on our indebtedness could suspend our eligibility to register securities using certain registration statement forms under sec guidelines that permit incorporation by reference of substantial information regarding us which could potentially hinder our ability to raise capital through the issuance of our securities and will increase the costs of such registration to us 

 

in may 2008 the fasb issued fasb staff position or fsp accounting principles board opinion or apb 141 “accounting for convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion including partial cash settlement” which will require us to recognize additional noncash interest expense related to our convertible senior notes in our consolidated statements of operations fsp apb 141 is effective for fiscal 2009 and is required to be applied retrospectively for all periods for which our convertible senior notes were outstanding before the date of adoption fsp apb 141 will have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition particularly with respect to interest expense ratios commonly referred to by lenders and could potentially hinder our ability to raise capital through the issuance of debt or equity securities 

 

conversion of the convertible senior notes will dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders 

 

the terms of the convertible senior notes permit the holders to convert the convertible senior notes into shares of our common stock the terms of the convertible senior notes stipulate a net share settlement which upon conversion of the convertible senior notes requires us to pay the principal amount in cash and the conversion premium if any in shares of our common stock based on a daily settlement amount calculated on a proportionate basis for each day of the relevant 20 tradingday observation period the initial conversion rate for the convertible senior notes is 472813 shares of our common stock per 1000 principal amount of convertible senior notes equivalent to a conversion price of approximately 2115 per share of our common stock the conversion price is subject to adjustment in some events but will not be adjusted for accrued interest except in limited circumstances the conversion of some or all of the convertible senior notes will dilute the ownership interest of our existing stockholders any sales in the public market of the common stock issuable upon conversion could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock 

each 1000 of principal of the convertible senior notes is initially convertible into 472813 shares of our common stock subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events holders of the convertible senior notes may convert their notes at their option on any day before the close of business on the scheduled trading day immediately preceding december 15 2011 in the case of the 2011 notes and december 15 2013 in the case of the 2013 notes in each case only if 

 

  

on and after november 2 2011 in the case of the 2011 notes and november 1 2013 in the case of the 2013 notes until the close of business on the scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date of such convertible senior notes holders may convert their convertible senior notes at any time regardless of the foregoing circumstances as of january 3 2009 none of the conditions allowing holders of the convertible senior notes to convert had been met 

 

although the conversion price of the convertible senior notes is currently 2115 per share concurrent with the issuance of the convertible senior notes we entered into hedge and separate warrant transactions to reduce the potential dilution from the conversion of the convertible senior notes however we cannot guarantee that such hedges and warrant instruments will fully mitigate the dilution in addition the existence of the convertible senior notes may encourage short selling by market participants because the conversion of the convertible senior notes could depress the price of our common stock 

 

at the option of the holders of the convertible senior notes under certain circumstances we may be required to repurchase the convertible senior notes in cash or shares of our common stock 

 

under the terms of the convertible senior notes we may be required to repurchase the convertible senior notes following a “fundamental change” in our corporate ownership or structure such as a change of control in which substantially all of the consideration does not consist of publicly traded securities prior to maturity of the convertible senior notes the repurchase price for the convertible senior notes in the event of a fundamental change must be paid solely in cash this repayment obligation may have the effect of discouraging delaying or preventing a takeover of our company that may otherwise be beneficial to investors 

 

hedge and warrant transactions entered into in connection with the issuance of the convertible senior notes may affect the value of our common stock 

 

we entered into hedge transactions with various financial institutions at the time of issuance of the convertible senior notes with the objective of reducing the potential dilutive effect of issuing our common stock upon conversion of the convertible senior notes we also entered into separate warrant transactions with the same financial institutions in connection with our hedge and warrant transactions these financial institutions purchased our common stock in secondary market transactions and entered into various overthecounter derivative transactions with respect to our common stock these entities or their affiliates are likely to modify their hedge positions from time to time prior to conversion or maturity of the convertible senior notes by purchasing and selling shares of our common stock other of our securities or other instruments they may wish to use in connection with such hedging any of these transactions and activities could adversely affect the value of our common stock and as a result the number of shares and the value of the common stock holders will receive upon conversion of the convertible senior notes in addition subject to movement in the price of our common stock if the hedge transactions settle in our favor we could be exposed to credit risk related to the other party with respect to the payment we are owed from such other party if the financial institutions with which we entered into these hedge transactions were to fail or default our ability to settle on these transactions could be harmed or delayed 

rating agencies may provide unsolicited ratings on the convertible senior notes that could reduce the market value or liquidity of our common stock 

 

we have not requested a rating of the convertible senior notes from any rating agency and we do not anticipate that the convertible senior notes will be rated however if one or more rating agencies independently elects to rate the convertible senior notes and assigns the convertible senior notes a rating lower than the rating expected by investors or reduces such rating in the future the market price or liquidity of the convertible senior notes and our common stock could be harmed should a decline in the market price of the convertible senior notes result as compared to the price of our common stock this may trigger the right of the holders of the convertible senior notes to convert the convertible senior notes into cash and shares of our common stock 

 

antitakeover defenses in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and certain provisions under delaware law could prevent an acquisition of our company or limit the price that investors might be willing to pay for our common stock 

 

our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and certain provisions of the delaware general corporation law that apply to us could make it difficult for another company to acquire control of our company for example 

 

  

all or any one of these factors could limit the price that certain investors would be willing to pay for shares of our common stock and could delay prevent or allow our board of directors to resist an acquisition of our company even if a proposed transaction were favored by a majority of our independent stockholders 

 




 item 1b unresolved staff comments 

 

none 

 




 item 2 properties 

 

we own land and buildings at our headquarters which is located in san jose california we also own buildings in india as of january 3 2009 the total square footage of our owned buildings was approximately 950000 which includes our newly constructed building located at our headquarters during the first quarter of fiscal 2009 we occupied all of the approximately 208000 square feet available in our new building 

 

in january 2007 we completed the sale of certain of our land and buildings in san jose california concurrently with the sale we leased back from the purchaser all available space in the buildings for two years the lease term ended in january 2009 and we have vacated the leased buildings 

 

we lease additional facilities in the united states and various other countries we sublease certain of these facilities where space is not fully utilized or has been involved in restructuring plans 

 

we believe that these facilities including our newly constructed building located at our headquarters are adequate for our current needs and that suitable additional or substitute space will be available as needed to accommodate any expansion of our operations 

 




 item 3 legal proceedings 

 

from time to time we are involved in various disputes and litigation that arise in the ordinary course of business these include disputes and lawsuits related to intellectual property mergers and acquisitions licensing 

contracts distribution arrangements and employee relations matters at least quarterly we review the status of each significant matter and assess its potential financial exposure if the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount or the range of loss can be estimated we accrue a liability for the estimated loss in accordance with sfas no 5 “accounting for contingencies” legal proceedings are subject to uncertainties and the outcomes are difficult to predict because of such uncertainties accruals are based only on the best information available at the time as additional information becomes available we reassess the potential liability related to pending claims and litigation matters and may revise estimates 

 

during fiscal 2008 three complaints were filed in the united states district court for the northern district of california or district court all alleging violations of sections 10b and 20a of the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended or exchange act and rule 10b5 promulgated thereunder on behalf of a purported class of purchasers of our common stock the plaintiffs in these actions allege that the company and the individual defendants made statements during the class period regarding our financial results that were false and misleading because we had recognized revenue that should have been recognized in subsequent quarters the plaintiffs requested certification of the actions as a class action unspecified damages and interest the plaintiffs’ reasonable costs including attorneys’ and experts’ fees and unspecified equitable or injunctive relief the first such complaint was filed on october 29 2008 captioned hu v cadence design systems inc michael j fister william porter and kevin s palatnik the second such complaint was filed on november 4 2008 captioned vyas v cadence design systems inc michael j fister and kevin s palatnik and the third such complaint was filed on november 21 2008 captioned collins v cadence design systems inc michael j fister john b shoven kevin s palatnik and william porter various plaintiffs have filed motions seeking to be named lead plaintiff and to have these complaints consolidated those motions are set to be heard by the court on march 6 2009 we intend to vigorously defend these and any other securities lawsuits that may be filed 

 

during fiscal 2008 two derivative complaints were filed in santa clara county superior court the first was filed on november 20 2008 and captioned ury priel derivatively on behalf of nominal defendant cadence design systems inc v john b shoven lipbu tan alberto sangiovannivincentelli donald l lucas sr roger siboni george scalise michael j fister and doe defendants 115 the second was filed on december 1 2008 and captioned mark levine derivatively on behalf of nominal defendant cadence design systems inc v john b shoven lipbu tan alberto sangiovannivincentelli donald l lucas sr roger siboni george scalise michael j fister john swainson and doe defendants 110 these complaints purport to bring suit derivatively on behalf of cadence against certain of our current and former directors for alleged breach of fiduciary duty abuse of control gross mismanagement waste of corporate assets and unjust enrichment many of the allegations underlying these claims are similar or identical to the allegations in the securities class action lawsuits described above and further allege that the individual defendants approved compensation based on inflated financial results the plaintiffs request unspecified damages restitution equitable relief and their reasonable attorneys’ fees experts’ fees costs and expenses on behalf of us against the individual defendants a motion to consolidate these complaints was granted on january 20 2009 we are analyzing these derivative complaints and will respond to them appropriately 

 

in light of the preliminary status of these lawsuits we cannot predict the claims allegations class period in the case of the class actions or outcome of these matters we cannot provide any assurances that the final outcome of these lawsuits or any other lawsuits or proceedings that may arise in the future will not have a material adverse effect on our business operating results or financial condition litigation can be timeconsuming and expensive and could divert management’s time and attention from our business which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and operating results 

 

while the outcome of these disputes and litigation matters cannot be predicted with any certainty management does not believe that the outcome of any current matters will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position liquidity or operating results

overview 

 

business overview 

 

we develop electronic design automation or eda software and hardware we license software sell or lease hardware technology provide maintenance for our software and hardware and provide engineering and education services throughout the world to help manage and accelerate product development processes for electronics our broad range of products and services are used by the world’s leading electronics companies to design and develop complex integrated circuits or ics and electronics systems 

 

we primarily generate revenue from licensing our eda software selling or leasing our hardware technology providing maintenance for our software and hardware and providing engineering services in the past our revenue recognition has been significantly affected by the mix of license types executed in any given period our revenue may also be deferred until payments become due and payable or cash is received from certain customers and for certain contracts for additional description of our revenue recognition see the discussion under the heading “critical accounting estimates — revenue recognition” below substantially all of our revenue is generated from ic manufacturers and designers and electronics systems companies and is dependent upon their commencement of new design projects as a result our revenue is significantly influenced by our customers’ business outlook and investment in the introduction of new products and the improvement of existing products 

 

the ic electronics systems and semiconductor industries are currently experiencing significant challenges primarily due to a deteriorating macroeconomic environment which is characterized by diminished product demand production overcapacity high inventory levels and accelerated erosion of average selling prices as a result of this downturn some of our customers faced financial challenges in fiscal 2008 and may continue to face such challenges in fiscal 2009 it is unclear when the macroeconomic environment may improve we are seeing increasing pressures on our customers’ research and development budgets and therefore our customers are looking for more flexibility in the type of software and hardware products they purchase and how and when they purchase them the current economic downturn in our customers’ industries has contributed to the substantial reduction in our revenue and could continue to harm our business operating results and financial condition 

 

facing uncertainty and cost pressures in their own businesses some of our customers are waiting to purchase our products and are increasingly seeking purchasing terms and conditions that are less favorable to us as a result of this trend we experienced lower business levels for fiscal 2008 and we have forecasted lower business levels for fiscal 2009 we recognized a net loss for fiscal 2008 and we expect to recognize a net loss for fiscal 2009 to enable us to keep our focus on the value of our technology and to assist with customer demands we are transitioning to a license mix that will provide our customers with greater flexibility and will result in a higher portion of our revenue being recognized ratably 

 

our customers may also experience adverse changes in their business and as a result may delay or default on their payment obligations file for bankruptcy or modify or cancel plans to license our products if our customers are not successful in generating sufficient revenue or are precluded from securing financing they may not be able to 

pay or may delay payment of accounts receivable that are owed to us although these obligations are generally not cancelable additionally our customers may seek to renegotiate existing contractual commitments though we have not yet experienced a material level of defaults any material payment default by our customers or significant reductions in existing contractual commitments could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results 

 

due to the decline in our stock price and market capitalization our fiscal 2008 net loss expected future net losses reduced future cash flow estimates and slower growth rates in our industry we recorded impairment charges totaling 13172 million in fiscal 2008 representing all of our acquired goodwill and we recorded an additional valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets of 3329 million 

 

we plan operating expense levels primarily based on forecasted revenue levels to offset some of the impact of our expected decrease in revenue we have implemented cost savings initiatives including reducing headcount decreasing employee bonuses and reducing other discretionary spending during fiscal 2008 we initiated a restructuring plan to improve our operating results and to align our cost structure with expected revenue this restructuring plan is intended to decrease costs by reducing our workforce throughout the company by at least 625 positions we expect ongoing annual savings of approximately 1500 million related to this restructuring plan 

 

product performance and size specifications of the mobile and other consumer electronics market are requiring electronic systems to be smaller consume less power and provide multiple functions in one systemonchip or soc or systeminpackage or sip the design challenge is also becoming more complex with each new generation of electronics because providers of eda solutions are required to deliver products that address these technical challenges and improve the efficiency and productivity of the design process in a priceconscious environment 

 

with the addition of emerging nanometer design considerations to the already burgeoning set of traditional design tasks complex soc or ic design can no longer be accomplished using a collection of discrete design tools what previously consisted of sequential design activities must be merged and accomplished nearly simultaneously without timeconsuming data translation steps we combine our design technologies into “platforms” addressing four major design activities functional verification digital ic design custom ic design and system interconnect design the four cadence design platforms are incisive functional verification encounter digital ic design virtuoso custom design and allegro system interconnect design platforms in addition we augment these platform product offerings with a set of dfm products that service both the digital and custom ic design flows these four platforms together with our dfm products comprised our primary product lines during fiscal 2008 in connection with our cost savings initiatives that were implemented during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 we made certain changes to our dfm product strategy including focusing on integrating dfm awareness into our core design platforms of encounter and virtuoso the changes in our dfm strategy resulted in an impairment charge of 425 million arising from the abandonment and reduction to net realizable value of certain identifiable intangible assets 

 

we have identified certain items that management uses as performance indicators to manage our business including revenue certain elements of operating expenses and cash flow from operations and we describe these items more fully below under the heading “results of operations” and “liquidity and capital resources” 

 

management 

 

on october 15 2008 we announced the resignation of michael j fister our president and chief executive officer and member of our board of directors and four other executive officers and in connection with mr fister’s resignation our board of directors formed an interim office of the chief executive or the ioce to oversee the daytoday running of our operations on january 8 2009 we announced the appointment of lipbu tan as our new president and chief executive officer and the dissolution of the ioce 

 

critical accounting estimates 

 

in preparing our consolidated financial statements we make assumptions judgments and estimates that can have a significant impact on our revenue operating income and net income as well as on the value of certain assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets we base our assumptions judgments and estimates on historical 

experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions at least quarterly we evaluate our assumptions judgments and estimates and make changes accordingly we believe that the assumptions judgments and estimates involved in the accounting for revenue recognition accounting for income taxes and valuation of goodwill and other longlived assets have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements therefore we consider these to be our critical accounting estimates 

 

historically our assumptions judgments and estimates relative to our critical accounting estimates have not differed materially from actual results for further information on our significant accounting policies see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements 

 

revenue recognition 

 

we apply the provisions of statement of position or sop 972 “software revenue recognition” as amended by sop 989 “modification of sop 972 software revenue recognition with respect to certain transactions” to all software licensing transactions and to all product revenue transactions where the software is not incidental we also apply the provisions of sfas no 13 “accounting for leases” to all hardware lease transactions we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists the product has been delivered the fee is fixed or determinable collection of the resulting receivable is probable and vendorspecific objective evidence of fair value or vsoe exists 

 

we license software using three different license types 

 

  

for many of our term and subscription license arrangements we use our proprietary internetbased delivery mechanism “edaontap” to facilitate the delivery of our software products to maximize the efficiency of this delivery mechanism we created what we refer to as “eda cards” of which there are two types subscription license customers may purchase what we refer to as an “eda platinum card” which provides the customer access to and use of all software products delivered at the outset of the arrangement and the ability to use additional unspecified software products that may become commercially available during the term of the arrangement term license customers may purchase what we refer to as an “eda gold card” which provides the customer access to and use of all software products delivered at the outset of the arrangement overall the eda cards provide greater flexibility for our customers in how and when they deploy and use our software products 

 

subscription licenses  – our subscription license arrangements offer our customers the right to 

 

  

customers that purchase an eda platinum card have the ability during the term of the arrangement to use software products delivered at the outset of the arrangement and to use other unspecified additional software products that may become commercially available during the term of the arrangement until the fees have been depleted 

in general revenue associated with subscription licenses is recognized ratably over the term of the license commencing upon the later of the effective date of the arrangement or delivery of the software product subscription license revenue is allocated to product and maintenance revenue the allocation to maintenance revenue is based on vendor specific objective evidence or vsoe of fair value of the undelivered maintenance that was established in connection with the sale of our term licenses 

 

in the event that a subscription license arrangement is terminated by mutual agreement and a new term license arrangement is entered into either concurrently with or after the termination of the subscription license arrangement the revenue associated with the new term license arrangement is recognized upon the later of the effective date of the arrangement or delivery of the software product assuming all other criteria in sop 972 have been met 

 

term licenses  – our term license arrangements offer our customers the right to 

 

  

customers that purchase an eda gold card have the ability during the term of the arrangement to use software products delivered at the outset of the arrangement until the fees relating to the arrangement have been depleted 

 

in general revenue associated with term licenses is recognized upon the later of the effective date of the arrangement or delivery of the software product 

 

perpetual licenses  – our perpetual licenses consist of software licensed on a perpetual basis with no right to return or exchange the licensed software in general revenue associated with perpetual licenses is recognized upon the later of the effective date of the license or delivery of the licensed product 

 

persuasive evidence of an arrangement  – generally we use a contract signed by the customer as evidence of an arrangement for subscription and term licenses and hardware leases if a contract signed by the customer does not exist we have historically used a purchase order as evidence of an arrangement for perpetual licenses hardware sales maintenance renewals and small fixedprice service projects such as training classes and small methodology service engagements of approximately 10000 or less for all other service engagements we use a signed professional services agreement and a statement of work to evidence an arrangement in cases where both a signed contract and a purchase order exist we consider the signed contract to be the most persuasive evidence of the arrangement sales through our distributors are evidenced by a master agreement governing the relationship together with binding purchase orders from the distributor on a transactionbytransaction basis 

 

product delivery  – software and the corresponding access keys are generally delivered to customers electronically electronic delivery occurs when we provide the customer access to the software occasionally we will deliver the software on a compact disc with standard transfer terms of freeonboard or fob shipping point our software license agreements generally do not contain conditions for acceptance with respect to hardware delivery of an entire system is deemed to occur upon its successful installation for certain hardware products installation is the responsibility of the customer as the system is fully functional at the time of shipment for these products delivery is deemed to be complete when the products are shipped with freight terms of fob shipping point 

 

for customers who purchase eda gold or eda platinum cards delivery occurs when the customer has been provided with access codes that allow the customer to download the software pursuant to the terms of the software license agreement 

 

fee is fixed or determinable  – we assess whether a fee is fixed or determinable at the outset of the arrangement primarily based on the payment terms associated with the transaction we have established a history of collecting 

under the original contract without providing concessions on payments products or services for our installment contracts that do not include a substantial up front payment we only consider that a fee is fixed or determinable if the arrangement has payment periods that are equal to or less than the term of the licenses and the payments are collected in equal or nearly equal installments when evaluated over the entire term of the arrangement we have a history of collecting receivables under installment contracts of up to five years 

 

significant judgment is involved in assessing whether a fee is fixed or determinable we must also make these judgments when assessing whether a contract amendment to a term arrangement primarily in the context of a license extension or renewal constitutes a concession our experience has been that we are able to determine whether a fee is fixed or determinable for term licenses while we do not expect that experience to change if we no longer were to have a history of collecting under the original contract without providing concessions on term licenses revenue from term licenses would be required to be recognized when payments under the installment contract become due and payable such a change could have a material impact on our results of operations 

 

collection is probable  – we assess the probability of collecting from each customer at the outset of the arrangement based on a number of factors including the customer’s payment history and its current creditworthiness we have concluded that collection is not probable for license arrangements executed with customers in certain countries if in our judgment collection of a fee is not probable we defer the revenue until the uncertainty is removed which generally means revenue is recognized upon receipt of cash payment our experience has been that we are able to estimate whether collection is probable while we do not expect that experience to change if we were to determine that collection is not probable for any license arrangement particularly those with installment payment terms revenue from such license would be recognized generally upon the receipt of cash payment such a change could have a material impact on our results of operations 

 

multiple element arrangement  – a multiple element arrangement or mea is any arrangement that includes or contemplates rights to a combination of software or hardware products software license types services training or maintenance in a single arrangement from time to time we may include individual deliverables in separately priced and separately signed contracts with the same customer we obtain and evaluate all known relevant facts and circumstances in determining whether the separate contracts should be accounted for individually as distinct arrangements or whether the separate contracts are in substance a mea significant judgment can be involved in determining whether a group of contracts might be so closely related that they are in effect part of a single arrangement 

 

vendorspecific objective evidence of fair value  – our vsoe for certain product elements of an arrangement is based upon the pricing in comparable transactions when the element is sold separately vsoe for maintenance is generally based upon the customer’s stated annual renewal rates vsoe for services is generally based on the price charged when the services are sold separately for multiple element arrangements vsoe must exist to allocate the total fee among all delivered and undelivered elements of a term or perpetual license arrangement if vsoe does not exist for all elements to support the allocation of the total fee among all delivered and undelivered elements of the arrangement revenue is deferred until such evidence does exist for the undelivered elements or until all elements are delivered whichever is earlier if vsoe of all undelivered elements exists but vsoe does not exist for one or more delivered elements revenue is recognized using the residual method under the residual method the vsoe of the undelivered elements is deferred and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee is recognized as revenue as the elements are delivered our experience has been that we are able to determine vsoe for maintenance and timebased services but not for product 

 

finance fee revenue  – finance fees result from discounting to present value the product revenue derived from our installment contracts in which the payment terms extend beyond one year from the effective date of the contract finance fees are recognized using a method that approximates the effective interest method over the relevant license term and are classified as product revenue finance fee revenue represented approximately 3 of total revenue for fiscal 2008 and 2 for each of fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006 upon the sale of an installment contract we recognize the remaining finance fee revenue associated with the installment contract 

 

services revenue  – services revenue consists primarily of revenue received for performing engineering services these services are not related to the functionality of the products licensed revenue from service contracts is recognized either on the time and materials method as work is performed or on the percentageof 

completion method for contracts with fixed or nottoexceed fees we estimate on a monthly basis the percentageofcompletion which is based on the completion of milestones relating to the arrangement we have a history of accurately estimating project status and the costs necessary to complete projects a number of internal and external factors can affect our estimates including labor rates utilization and efficiency variances and specification and testing requirement changes if different conditions were to prevail such that accurate estimates could not be made then the use of the completed contract method would be required and the recognition of all revenue and costs would be deferred until the project was completed such a change could have a material impact on our results of operations 

 

accounting for income taxes 

 

we provide for the effect of income taxes in our consolidated financial statements in accordance with sfas no 109 and fin no 48 

 

under sfas no 109 income tax expense or benefit is recognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and for deferred tax assets and liabilities for the tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity’s financial statements or tax returns we must make significant assumptions judgments and estimates to determine our current provision for income taxes our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance to be recorded against our deferred tax assets our judgments assumptions and estimates relating to the current provision for income taxes include the geographic mix and amount of income loss our interpretation of current tax laws and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax authorities our judgments also include anticipating the tax positions we will take on tax returns before actually preparing and filing the tax returns changes in our business tax laws or our interpretation of tax laws and developments in current and future tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our results of operations financial position or cash flows 

 

deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to tax benefit carryforwards and to differences between the financial statement amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis we regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized to make this assessment we take into account predictions of the amount and category of taxable income from various sources and all available positive and negative evidence about these possible sources of taxable income as required under sfas no 109 the weight given to the potential effect of negative and positive evidence is commensurate with the extent to which the strength of the evidence can be objectively verified for example a company’s current or previous losses are given more weight than its future outlook for the year ended january 3 2009 we concluded that a significant increase in valuation allowance was required based on our evaluation and weighting of the positive and negative evidence if in the future we determine that these deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized a release of all or part of the related valuation allowance could result in a material income tax benefit in the period such determination is made for additional description of the fiscal 2008 valuation allowance see the discussion under the heading “results of operations — provision for income taxes” below 

 

under fin no 48 we may only recognize an income tax position in our financial statements that we judge is more likely than not to be sustained solely on its technical merits in a tax audit including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes to make this judgment we must interpret the application of complex and sometimes ambiguous tax laws regulations and practices if an income tax position meets the more likely than not recognition threshold then we must measure the amount of the tax benefit to be recognized by determining the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than a 50 likelihood of being realized upon effective settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all of the relevant facts it is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts as this requires us to determine the probability of various possible settlement outcomes to determine if a tax position is effectively settled we must also estimate the likelihood that a taxing authority would review a tax position after a tax examination had otherwise been completed we must also determine when it is reasonably possible that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits will significantly increase or decrease in the 12 months after each fiscal yearend these judgments are difficult because a taxing authority may change its behavior as a result of our disclosures in our financial statements that are based on the requirements of fin no 48 we must reevaluate our income tax positions on a quarterly basis to consider factors such as changes in facts or circumstances changes 

in tax law effectively settled issues under audit and new audit activity such a change in recognition or measurement would result in recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision 

 

we are also required to assess whether the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries will be indefinitely reinvested outside the united states given the escalating challenges in the global capital markets during fiscal 2008 we decided to repatriate 2500 million of earnings from a foreign subsidiary to the united states that had previously been considered to be indefinitely reinvested outside the united states and for which deferred taxes had not been previously provided we currently expect that an additional 672 million of previously untaxed earnings from foreign subsidiaries will not be indefinitely reinvested outside of the united states as a result we have accrued a tax expense of 1011 million during fiscal 2008 to provide for the potential federal state and foreign income taxes on these repatriations to calculate this tax expense we were required to estimate the geographic mix of profits and losses earned by us and our subsidiaries in tax jurisdictions with a broad range of income and dividend withholding tax rates the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations and the potential outcomes of current and future tax audits changes in our actual or projected operating results tax laws or our interpretation of tax laws foreign exchange rates and developments in current and future tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our results of operations financial position or cash flows 

 

valuation of goodwill and other longlived assets 

 

goodwill 

 

costs in excess of the fair value of tangible and other intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a purchase business combination are recorded as goodwill sfas no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” requires that companies not amortize goodwill but instead test for impairment at least annually we have evaluated goodwill on an annual basis since our adoption of sfas no 142 and whenever events and changes in circumstances suggest that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 

 

impairment of goodwill is tested at the reporting unit level by comparing the reporting unit’s carrying amount including goodwill to the fair value of the reporting unit the fair values of the reporting units are estimated using a combination of the income or discounted cash flows approach and the market approach which utilizes comparable companies’ data if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value goodwill is considered to be impaired and a second step is performed to measure the amount of the impairment loss 

 

the preparation of the goodwill impairment analysis requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions with respect to the determination of fair values of reporting units and tangible and intangible assets these estimates and assumptions which include future values are complex and often subjective and may differ significantly from period to period based on changes in the overall economic environment changes in our industry and changes in our strategy or our internal forecasts estimates and assumptions with respect to the determination of the fair value of our reporting unit include 

 

  

these estimates and assumptions along with others are used to estimate the fair value of our reporting unit as well as tangible and intangible assets while we believe the estimates and assumptions we used are reasonable different assumptions may materially impact the resulting fair value of the reporting unit tangible assets and intangible assets the amount of impairment we record in any given period and our results of operations 

 

we engage independent valuation experts to assess the reasonableness of our assumptions and to perform certain portions of our goodwill impairment analysis 

other longlived assets 

 

we review longlived assets including certain identifiable intangibles for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that we will not be able to recover an asset’s carrying amount in accordance with sfas no 144 “accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets” in addition we assess our longlived assets for impairment if they are abandoned 

 

for longlived assets to be held and used including acquired intangibles we initiate our review whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a longlived asset may not be recoverable recoverability of an asset is measured by comparing its carrying amount to the expected future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of that asset excluding future interest costs that would be recognized as an expense when incurred any impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair market value significant management judgment is required in 

 

  

in future periods material impairment charges could be necessary should different conditions prevail or different judgments be made 

 

results of operations 

 

as noted above we saw increasing pressures on the research and development budgets in our customer base due to the deceleration of growth in the electronics systems and semiconductor industries and the deteriorating macroeconomic environment in addition the escalating challenges in the global capital markets made it important to keep cash available and held in shortterm lowrisk investments 

 

fiscal 2008 financial results reflected the following 

 

  

revenue 

 

we primarily generate revenue from licensing our eda software selling or leasing our hardware technology providing maintenance for our software and hardware and providing engineering services we principally utilize three license types subscription term and perpetual the different license types provide a customer with different conditions of use for our products such as 

 

  

customer decisions regarding these aspects of license transactions determine the license type timing of revenue recognition and potential future business activity for example if a customer chooses a fixed duration of use this will result in either a subscription or term license a business implication of this decision is that at the expiration of the license period the customer must decide whether to continue using the technology and therefore 

renew the license agreement because larger customers generally use products from two or more of our five product groups rarely will a large customer completely terminate its relationship with us at expiration of the license see the discussion under the heading “critical accounting estimates — revenue recognition” above for additional description of license types and timing of revenue recognition 

 

although we believe that pricing volatility has not generally been a material component of the change in our revenue from period to period we believe that the amount of revenue recognized in future periods will depend on among other things the 

 

   

a substantial portion of our total revenue is recognized over multiple periods in the past a significant portion of our product revenue has been recognized upon delivery of licensed software which generally occurs upon the later of the effective date of the arrangement or delivery of the software product we are moving to a license mix that will result in increased ratable revenue and we expect the percentage of product revenue from backlog to increase in future years 

 

the value and duration of contracts and consequently product revenue recognized is affected by the competitiveness of our products product revenue recognized in any period is also affected by the extent to which customers purchase subscription term or perpetual licenses and the extent to which contracts contain flexible payment terms the timing of revenue recognition is also affected by changes in the extent to which existing contracts contain flexible payment terms and by changes in contractual arrangements with existing customers eg customers transitioning from subscription license arrangements to term license arrangements 

 

revenue mix 

 

we analyze our software and hardware businesses by product group combining revenues for both product and maintenance because of their interrelationship during fiscal 2008 fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006 our product groups were as follows 

 

functional verification  products in this group which include the incisive functional verification platform are used to verify that the high level logical representation of an ic design is functionally correct 

 

digital ic design  products in this group which include the encounter digital ic design platform are used to accurately convert the highlevel logical representation of a digital ic into a detailed physical blueprint and then detailed design information showing how the ic will be physically implemented this data is used for creation of the photomasks used in chip manufacture 

 

custom ic design  our custom design products which include the virtuoso custom design platform are used for ics that must be designed at the transistor level including analog radio frequency memories high performance digital blocks and standard cell libraries detailed design information showing how an ic will be physically implemented is used for creation of the photomasks used in chip manufacture 

 

system interconnect design  this product group consists of our pcb and ic package design products including the allegro and orcad products the allegro system interconnect design platform enables consistent codesign of interconnects across ics ic packages and pcbs while the orcad line focuses on costeffective entrylevel pcb solutions 

 

design for manufacturing  included in this product group are our physical verification and analysis products these products are used to analyze and verify that the physical blueprint of the ic has been constructed correctly and can be manufactured successfully in connection with our cost savings initiatives that were implemented during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 we made certain changes to our dfm product 

strategy including focusing on integrating dfm awareness into our core design platforms of encounter and virtuoso the changes in our dfm strategy resulted in an impairment charge of 425 million arising from the abandonment and reduction to net realizable value of certain identifiable intangible assets 

 

for additional description of our current product strategy see the discussion under the heading “products and product strategy” under item 1 “business” above 

 

revenue by year 

 

the following table shows our revenue for fiscal 2008 fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006 and the dollar change in revenue between years 

 

 

 

product revenue decreased during fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 primarily because of lower business levels due to the challenges in the current macroeconomic environment the timing of our contract renewals with existing customers our transition to a ratable license mix and a longer sales cycle as a result product revenue decreased for all product groups and particularly for digital ic design custom ic design and functional verification products during fiscal 2008 due to the lower business levels and the change in the license mix in the second half of fiscal 2008 we expect to recognize decreased revenue during fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 

 

product revenue was higher during fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 primarily because of increased revenue from licenses for digital ic design functional verification and custom ic design products partially offset by a small decrease in revenue from licenses for dfm products 

 

revenue by product group 

 

the following table shows the percentage of product and related maintenance revenue contributed by each of our five product groups and services and other during fiscal 2008 fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006 

 

 

 

as described under the heading “critical accounting estimates” above certain of our licenses allow customers the ability to remix among software products additionally we have licensed a combination of our products to customers with the actual product selection and number of licensed users to be determined at a later date for these arrangements we estimate the allocation of the revenue to product groups based upon the expected usage of our products by these customers the actual usage of our products by these customers may differ and if that proves to be the case the revenue allocation in the above table would differ 

although we believe the methodology of allocating revenue to product groups is reasonable there can be no assurance that such allocated amounts reflect the amounts that would result had the customer individually licensed each specific software solution at the onset of the arrangement 

 

revenue by geography 

 

 

 

revenue by geography as a percentage of total revenue 

 

 

 

the rate of revenue change varies geographically primarily due to differences in the timing and size of term licenses in those regions no single customer accounted for 10 or more of total revenue during fiscal 2008 fiscal 2007 or fiscal 2006 

 

changes in foreign currency exchange rates caused our revenue to increase by 245 million during fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 primarily due to a decrease in the valuation of the united states dollar when compared to the japanese yen and the european union euro partially offset by an increase in the valuation of the united states dollar when compared to the british pound changes in foreign currency exchange rates caused our revenue to increase by 29 million in 2007 compared to 2006 primarily due to a decrease in the valuation of the united states dollar when compared to the european union euro and the british pound partially offset by an increase in the valuation of the united states dollar when compared to the japanese yen additional information about revenue and other financial information by geography can be found in note 21 to our consolidated financial statements 

stockbased compensation expense summary 

 

stockbased compensation expense is reflected throughout our costs and expenses during fiscal 2008 fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006 as follows 

 

 

 

stockbased compensation expense decreased 201 million during fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 and 26 million during fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 due to the following 

 

 

 

stockbased compensation expense related to restricted stock awards and restricted stock units collectively referred to as restricted stock and stock bonuses decreased during fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 primarily due to the reversal of 65 million of stockbased compensation expense related to the modification of certain performancebased restricted stock awards new grants of restricted stock being valued at a lower stock price and a decrease in stock bonuses stockbased compensation expense related to restricted stock and stock bonuses increased during fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 as we issued more restricted stock in place of stock options and due to our increased stock price during fiscal 2007 

 

stockbased compensation expense related to stock options decreased in each of fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 primarily due to our increased use of restricted stock instead of stock options partially offset by an increase in stock option expense during fiscal 2008 due to the acceleration of vesting for the five executive officers that resigned during fiscal 2008 

 

we expect stockbased compensation expense to continue to decrease during fiscal 2009 primarily due to lower fair values at grant dates for both restricted stock and stock options and due to the cancellation of restricted stock and stock options due to our restructuring plan and other attrition 

 

expected effects of restructuring plans 

 

we plan operating expense levels primarily based on forecasted revenue levels to offset some of the impact of our expected decrease in revenue we have implemented cost savings initiatives including reducing headcount decreasing employee bonuses and reducing other discretionary spending during fiscal 2008 we initiated a restructuring plan to improve our operating results and to align our cost structure with expected revenue this restructuring plan is intended to decrease costs by reducing our workforce throughout the company by at least 625 positions we expect ongoing annual savings of approximately 1500 million related to this restructuring plan 

cost of revenue 

 

 

 

the following table shows cost of revenue as a percentage of related revenue for fiscal 2008 fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006 

 

 

 

cost of product 

 

cost of product includes costs associated with the sale or lease of our hardware and licensing of our software products cost of product primarily includes the cost of employee salary benefits and other employeerelated costs including stockbased compensation expense amortization of acquired intangibles directly related to our products the cost of technical documentation and royalties payable to thirdparty vendors cost of product associated with our hardware products also includes materials assembly and overhead these additional manufacturing costs make our cost of hardware product higher as a percentage of revenue than our cost of software product cost of product as a percentage of product revenue increased during fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 primarily due to decreased software product revenue during fiscal 2008 

 

a summary of cost of product during fiscal 2008 fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006 is as follows 

 

 

 

cost of product decreased 98 million during fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 and 67 million during fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 due to the following 

 

 

 

hardware costs decreased during fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 primarily due to a decrease in hardware sales partially offset by a writeoff of obsolete inventory during fiscal 2008 hardware costs increased during fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 primarily due to an increase in hardware sales 

amortization of acquired intangibles decreased in each of fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 and during fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 because certain acquired intangible assets became fully amortized during the related periods we expect the amortization of acquired intangibles component of cost of product to decrease during fiscal 2009 due to the impairment of certain acquired intangibles during fiscal 2008 

 

cost of product depends primarily upon the extent to which we acquire intangible assets acquire licenses and incorporate thirdparty technology in our products that are licensed or sold in any given period and the actual mix of hardware and software product sales in any given period 

 

cost of services 

 

cost of services primarily includes employee salary benefits and other employeerelated costs costs to maintain the infrastructure necessary to manage a services organization and provisions for contract losses if any cost of services increased 99 million during fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 and decreased 31 million during fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 due to the following 

 

 

 

cost of maintenance 

 

cost of maintenance includes the cost of customer services such as hotline and onsite support employee salary benefits and other employeerelated costs and documentation of maintenance updates cost of maintenance decreased 53 million during fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 and decreased 27 million during fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 due to the following 

 

 

 

operating expenses 

 

 47 

 

 

the following table shows operating expenses as percentage of total revenue for fiscal 2008 fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006 

 

 

 

our operating expenses as a percentage of total revenue increased during fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 due to our lower product revenue during the period 

 

marketing and sales 

 

marketing and sales expense decreased 487 million during fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 and increased 15 million during fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 due to the following 

 

 

 

salary commissions benefits and other employeerelated costs decreased during fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 primarily due to a reduction in headcount and a decrease in employee bonuses these costs increased during fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 primarily due to increased headcount and higher bonuses earned during fiscal 2007 travel and customer conference costs decreased during fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 as we reduced certain discretionary spending 

 

during fiscal 2007 we recognized a gain on the sale of land and buildings that related to and accordingly reduced marketing and sales expense for that period there was no similar reduction during fiscal 2008 

research and development 

 

research and development expense decreased 361 million during fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 and increased 339 million during fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 due to the following 

 

 

 

salary benefits and other employeerelated costs decreased during fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 due to a reduction in headcount and a decrease in employee bonuses these costs increased during fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 primarily due to increased headcount and higher bonuses earned during fiscal 2007 

 

professional services costs decreased during fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 due to our overall spending reductions and cost savings initiatives implemented during the year 

 

during fiscal 2007 we recognized a gain on the sale of land and buildings that related to and accordingly reduced research and development expense for that period there was no similar reduction during fiscal 2008 

 

general and administrative 

 

general and administrative expense decreased 170 million during fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 and increased 257 million during fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 due to the following 

 

 

 

salary benefits and other employeerelated costs decreased during fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 due to a reduction in headcount and a decrease in employee bonuses these costs increased during fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 primarily due to increased headcount and higher bonuses earned during fiscal 2007 

losses on the sale of installment contract receivables decreased during fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 due to a reduction in sales of receivables as a result of the credit losses recorded by banks during 2008 and the current financial challenges experienced by banks a number of banks have become less willing to purchase assets because of capital constraints and concerns about overexposure to the technology sector in addition the change in our license mix will result in an increased number of subscription licenses and a decrease in the sale of receivables to financial institutions losses on the sale of installment contract receivables decreased during fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 due to the lower discount rates available to us during fiscal 2007 

 

litigation legal and other professional services costs decreased during fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 due to litigation costs incurred in fiscal 2007 that did not recur in fiscal 2008 offset by increased professional services fees related to our proposed acquisition of mentor graphics corporation and the restatement of our previously issued financial statements for the periods ended march 29 2008 and june 28 2008 see additional discussion of our current litigation under the heading item 3 “legal proceedings” above litigation legal and other professional services costs increased during fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 primarily due to an increase in litigation costs incurred in fiscal 2007 

 

bad debt expense increased during fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 due to the challenges currently affecting the economy of the united states and other regions of the world as a result our customers may experience adverse changes in their business which may result in a delay or default on their payment obligations bad debt expense increased during fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 reflecting a lower amount of bad debt recoveries during fiscal 2007 

 

executive severance costs in fiscal 2008 relate to the cash payable to three of the five executives who resigned in october 2008 the expense related to the other two resignations of our executive officers is included in our sales and marketing and research and development expenses 

 

amortization of acquired intangibles 

 

 

 

amortization of acquired intangibles increased 33 million during fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 and decreased 37 million during fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 due to the following 

 

 

 

during fiscal 2008 we impaired acquired intangibles of 425 million which will decrease our amortization of acquired intangibles beginning during fiscal 2009 for additional description of this impairment see the discussion under the heading “impairment of intangible and tangible assets” below 

 

restructuring and other charges 

 

during fiscal 2008 we initiated a restructuring plan or the 2008 restructuring plan to decrease costs by reducing our workforce across the company and by consolidating facilities we recorded total costs associated with the 2008 restructuring plan of 467 million during fiscal 2008 for severance and benefits excess facilities and other charges we regularly evaluate the adequacy of our severance and related benefits accrual and adjust the balance based on actual costs incurred or changes in estimates and assumptions we may incur future charges to 

reflect actual costs incurred or for changes in estimates related to amounts previously recorded and for additional activities under the 2008 restructuring plan 

 

we also initiated restructuring plans in each year from 2001 through 2005 or the other restructuring plans in an effort to operate more efficiently as of january 3 2009 the balance of 63 million related to the other restructuring plans consisted solely of estimated lease losses 

 

facility closure and office space reduction costs included in our restructuring plans are comprised of payments required under leases less any applicable estimated sublease income after the properties are abandoned lease buyout costs and other contractual charges to estimate the lease loss which is the loss after our cost recovery efforts from subleasing all or part of a building we made certain assumptions related to the time period over which the relevant building would remain vacant and sublease terms including sublease rates and contractual common area charges 

 

each reporting period we evaluate the adequacy of the lease loss accruals related to all of our restructuring plans when necessary we adjust the lease loss accruals for changes in real estate markets or other factors that may affect estimated costs or sublease income we also consider executed sublease agreements and adjust the lease loss accruals if sublease income under the agreements differ from initial estimates the credits recorded in connection with the other restructuring plans during fiscal 2006 fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2008 relate primarily to changes in lease loss estimates 

 

as of january 3 2009 our estimate of the accrued lease loss related to all worldwide restructuring plans initiated since 2001 was 84 million this amount will be adjusted in the future if there are changes in the assumptions used to estimate the lease loss the lease loss could range as high as 113 million if sublease rental rates decrease in applicable markets or if it takes longer than currently expected to find a suitable tenant to sublease the facilities 

 

because the restructuring charges and related benefits are derived from management’s estimates made during the formulation of the restructuring plans based on thencurrently available information our restructuring plans may not achieve the benefits anticipated on the timetable or at the level contemplated demand for our products and services and ultimately our future financial performance is difficult to predict with any degree of certainty and is especially difficult to predict in light of the current economic challenges and uncertainty accordingly additional actions including further restructuring of our operations may be required in the future 

 

2008 restructuring plan 

 

the following table presents restructuring and other charges for the 2008 restructuring plan 

 

 

 

during fiscal 2008 we recorded 443 million of headcount reduction costs associated with the 2008 restructuring plan which included severance payments severancerelated benefits and costs for outplacement services the costs recorded during fiscal 2008 are net of a reversal of 49 million recorded during the fourth quarter of 2008 due to termination and related benefits costs that were less than the initial estimate of 481 million recorded during the third quarter of fiscal 2008 the net costs recorded during fiscal 2008 include severance and severancerelated benefits that were communicated to the affected employees before january 3 2009 and estimated costs that were both probable and estimable for employees who were notified after january 3 2009 

 

we provide severance and termination benefits according to the varying regulations in the jurisdictions and countries in which we operate in accordance with these regulations termination benefits of approximately 154 million were paid to employees before january 3 2009 and termination benefits of approximately 297 million will be paid after january 3 2009 we expect to pay substantially all benefits by january 2 2010 we expect ongoing annual savings of approximately 1500 million related to the 2008 restructuring plan 

other restructuring plans 

 

the following table presents restructuring and other charges for fiscal 2008 fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006 associated with the other restructuring plans 

 

 

 

during fiscal 2007 we completed a lease termination agreement for a facility included in the 2001 restructuring plan whereby we paid 82 million and were released from all future obligations related to the facility we recorded a credit to restructuring and other charges of 71 million during the year ended december 29 2007 representing the lease loss accrual related to this facility in excess of the amount paid 

 

writeoff of acquired inprocess research and development 

 

upon consummation of an acquisition we immediately charge to expense any acquired inprocess research and development that has not yet reached technological feasibility and has no alternative future use the value assigned to acquired inprocess research and development is determined by identifying research projects in areas for which technological feasibility has not been established the values are determined by estimating costs to develop the acquired inprocess research and development into commercially viable products estimating the resulting net cash flows from such projects and discounting the net cash flows back to their present value the discount rates utilized include a factor that reflects the uncertainty surrounding successful development of the acquired inprocess research and development 

 

the following table summarizes our writeoffs of acquired inprocess research and development charges during fiscal 2008 fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006 

 

 

 

the following table summarizes as of january 3 2009 the status of inprocess research and development acquired during fiscal 2008 fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006 

 

 

impairment of goodwill 

 

in accordance with sfas no 142 we conduct a goodwill impairment analysis annually and as necessary if changes in facts and circumstances indicate that the fair value of our reporting unit may be less than the carrying amount for additional description of our goodwill impairment analysis see the discussion under the heading “critical accounting estimates — valuation of goodwill and other longlived assets” above 

 

we completed our annual impairment analysis of goodwill during the third quarter of fiscal 2008 and we determined at that time that we satisfied the first step of the twostep goodwill impairment test and no impairment of goodwill was recorded however during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 we observed impairment indicators including a further deterioration in the market in which we operate and a decrease in our market capitalization as such we determined that certain indicators indicated that the fair value of our reporting unit was less than its carrying amount accordingly in connection with the preparation of our yearend financial statements we completed an interim goodwill impairment test during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 and recorded an impairment of goodwill of 13172 million representing all of our goodwill 

 

during the third quarters of fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006 we completed our annual impairment analysis of goodwill based on the results of these impairment reviews we determined that no indicators of impairment existed for our one reporting unit and accordingly no impairment charge was recognized during fiscal 2007 or fiscal 2006 

 

impairment of intangible and tangible assets 

 

in connection with our cost savings initiatives that were implemented during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 we made certain changes to our dfm product strategy as a result we recognized an impairment charge of 425 million arising from the abandonment of certain identifiable intangible assets and reducing to net realizable value certain other identifiable intangible assets we also abandoned and impaired 46 million of other longlived assets during fiscal 2008 there were no such impairments during fiscal 2007 or fiscal 2006 

 

loss on extinguishment of debt 

 

we recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of 408 million during fiscal 2006 which includes a premium paid to repurchase a portion of the 2023 notes of 389 million and a writeoff of the related portion of unamortized deferred costs of issuing the 2023 notes of 19 million 

 

interest expense 

 

 

 

interest expense decreased 08 million in 2008 as compared to 2007 primarily due to the increase of 04 million in capitalized interest relating to a building under construction at our headquarters and a decrease in interest of 02 million related to our term loan which was entered into on december 19 2005 and the repayment of which was completed in march 2007 

 

during 2007 the primary component of interest expense was the convertible senior notes which were issued in december 2006 during 2006 the primary component of interest expense was our term loan the repayment of which was completed in march 2007 

 

we expect interest expense to increase during fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 due to the inclusion of approximately 200 million of noncash interest expense resulting from our adoption of fsp apb 141 in addition fsp apb 141 requires retrospective adoption which will require us to adjust our consolidated financial statements for prior years to reflect increased interest expense in each of those years 

other income expenses net 

 

other income expenses net for fiscal 2008 fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006 was as follows 

 

 

 

the decrease in interest income in 2008 as compared to 2007 was due to lower average cash balances and lower interest rates the increase in interest income in 2007 as compared to 2006 was due to higher average cash balances and higher interest rates we expect interest income to decrease during fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 due to the expected combination of lower average cash balances and lower interest rates 

 

during fiscal 2008 we determined that two of our availableforsale securities were otherthantemporarily impaired based on the severity and the duration of the impairments and we wrote down the investments by 81 million we determined that four of our nonmarketable securities were otherthantemporarily impaired during fiscal 2008 and we wrote down the investments by 86 million 

 

during fiscal 2008 we purchased approximately 43 million shares of mentor graphics common stock in connection with our proposed acquisition of mentor graphics after the announcement of our withdrawal of the proposed acquisition of mentor graphics we sold our entire equity interest in mentor graphics at a loss of 94 million 

 

the 93 million loss on liquidation of subsidiary is primarily attributable to currency translation adjustment losses net of gains previously recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income on our consolidated balance sheet for a subsidiary that was completely liquidated during fiscal 2008 there were no significant gains or losses during fiscal 2007 or fiscal 2006 

 

in january 2006 khimetrics inc a cost method investment held by telos venture partners a limited partnership in which we and our 1996 deferred compensation venture investment plan trust were the sole limited partners was sold for consideration of 653 per share of common stock in connection with this sale we received approximately 202 million in cash and recorded a gain of approximately 171 million during fiscal 2006 in addition our 1996 deferred compensation venture investment plan trust received 29 million in cash and recorded a gain of 25 million during fiscal 2006 under the purchase agreement an additional 10 of the consideration was held in escrow which was released to us and to the trust in january 2007 upon receipt of these additional proceeds we recorded a gain of 26 million and our 1996 deferred compensation venture investment plan trust recorded a gain of 04 million during fiscal 2007 

provision for income taxes 

 

the provision for income taxes and the effective tax rates during fiscal 2008 fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006 were as follows 

 

 

 

during fiscal 2008 we had a loss before provision for income taxes and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle including the impairment of 10597 million of united states goodwill that was nondeductible we also increased the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets by 3329 million because of the uncertainty regarding their ultimate realization in making this judgment we considered the current year loss that resulted in a cumulative threeyear loss and other factors see discussion below for further details 

 

further given the escalating challenges in the global capital markets during fiscal 2008 we decided to repatriate 2500 million of earnings from a foreign subsidiary to the united states that had previously been considered to be indefinitely reinvested outside the united states and for which deferred taxes had not been previously provided we currently expect that an additional 672 million of previously untaxed earnings from foreign subsidiaries will not be indefinitely reinvested outside of the united states as a result we have accrued a tax expense of 1011 million during fiscal 2008 to provide for the federal state and foreign income taxes on these repatriations we intend to indefinitely reinvest the remainder of undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries of approximately 378 million as of january 3 2009 to meet both the working capital and longterm capital needs of our subsidiaries and of cadence the unrecognized deferred tax liability for these indefinitely reinvested foreign earnings was approximately 155 million as of january 3 2009 

 

our effective tax rate was negative for fiscal 2008 as compared to the positive effective tax rates for fiscal 2007 primarily due to the loss before provision for income taxes and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle and the tax expenses related to the increase in our valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets repatriations of foreign earnings impairment of nondeductible goodwill income of certain foreign subsidiaries and interest expense on our unrecognized tax benefits 

 

our effective tax rate decreased during fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 primarily due to the decrease in net unrecognized tax benefit of 278 million as a result of the effective settlement of certain tax matters with the irs in december 2007 and an increase in benefit from foreign income which is taxed at a lower rate than the united states federal statutory income tax rate of 306 million resulting from the conclusion of certain transfer pricing arrangements with a foreign subsidiary in 2006 

 

we currently expect the effective tax rate for fiscal 2009 to be approximately 160 the effective tax rate is negative because we anticipate having a loss before provision for income taxes and because we expect to have tax expense on the income of certain foreign subsidiaries and interest expense on our unrecognized tax benefits in addition we currently anticipate recording a valuation allowance that will offset the potential tax benefit of certain tax loss and credit carryforwards generated during fiscal 2009 however we expect that the effective tax rate for interim reporting periods during fiscal 2009 will vary from the estimated annual effective tax rate because of the recognition of periodspecific items of tax expense or benefit such as interest expense related to unrecognized tax benefits 

 

net deferred tax assets and irs examinations 

 

we regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized we consider various sources of taxable income and all available positive and negative evidence about these possible sources of taxable income as required by sfas no 109 a company’s current or previous losses are given more weight than its future outlook under this standard our current year loss in fiscal 2008 which included the impairment of goodwill and other intangible and tangible assets resulted in a cumulative threeyear loss and was considered a significant negative 

factor the current year loss the uncertain and negative market and economic conditions which severely limited our visibility to the timing and extent of an economic recovery and our expectation of a net loss in the near term were considered significant negative evidence with a high level of objectivity that outweighed our ability to rely on our longer term projections of future taxable income in determining whether a valuation allowance was needed accordingly we concluded that an increase in valuation allowance of 3329 million was required as of january 3 2009 if in the future we determine that these deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized a release of all or part of the related valuation allowance could result in a material income tax benefit in the period such determination is made as of january 3 2009 we had total net deferred tax assets of approximately 664 million the net deferred tax assets are primarily composed of united states net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards the net deferred tax assets are presented gross of unrecognized tax benefits which are not directly associated with the net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards although we cannot guarantee that we will be able to realize these deferred tax assets we believe that it is more likely than not that we will be able to realize the net deferred tax assets over time 

 

in july 2006 the irs completed its field examination of our federal income tax returns for the tax years 2000 through 2002 and issued an rar in which the irs proposed to assess an aggregate tax deficiency for the threeyear period of approximately 3240 million in november 2006 the irs revised the proposed aggregate tax deficiency for the threeyear period to be approximately 3180 million the irs is contesting our qualification for deferred recognition of certain proceeds received from restitution and settlement in connection with litigation during the period the proposed tax deficiency for this item is approximately 1520 million the remaining proposed tax deficiency of approximately 1660 million is primarily related to proposed adjustments to our transfer pricing arrangements that we had with foreign subsidiaries and to our deductions for foreign trade income the irs may make similar claims against our transfer pricing arrangements and deductions for foreign trade income in future examinations we have filed a timely protest with the irs and are seeking resolution of the issues with the appeals office 

 

we believe that the proposed irs adjustments are inconsistent with applicable tax laws and we are vigorously challenging these proposed adjustments the rar is not a final statutory notice of deficiency but the irs imposes interest on the proposed deficiencies until the matters are resolved interest is compounded daily at rates published by the irs which rates are adjusted quarterly and have been between 4 and 10 since 2001 the irs is currently examining our federal income tax returns for the tax years 2003 through 2005 

 

significant judgment is required in applying the principles of fin no 48 and sfas no 109 the calculation of our provision for income taxes involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes we regularly assess the potential settlement outcomes resulting from income tax examinations however the final outcome of tax examinations including the total amount payable or the timing of any such payments upon resolution of these issues cannot be estimated with certainty in addition we cannot be certain that such amount will not be materially different than that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals should the irs or other tax authorities assess additional taxes as a result of a current or a future examination we may be required to record charges to operations in future periods that could have a material impact on our results of operations financial position or cash flows in the applicable period or periods

our existing cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investment balances may decline during the first quarter of fiscal 2009 and continue to decline during fiscal 2009 in the event of a further deterioration in the economy or the capital markets a reduction in our cash receipts or changes in our cash outlays however we expect that current cash and shortterm investment balances and cash flows that are generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital and other capital requirements for at least the next 12 months 

net working capital 

 

net working capital decreased 3537 million as of january 3 2009 as compared to december 29 2007 and 198 million as of december 29 2007 as compared to december 30 2006 due to the following 

 

 

 

cash and cash equivalents decreased as of january 3 2009 primarily due to 2302 of principal payments on our 2023 notes and 2740 million of repurchases of our common stock 

 

cash flows from operating activities 

 

net cash provided by operating activities decreased 3321 million during fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 and 188 million during fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 due to the following 

 

 

 

cash flows provided by operating activities include net income loss adjusted for certain noncash charges as well as changes in the balances of certain assets and liabilities our cash flows from operating activities are significantly influenced by business levels the payment terms set forth in our license agreements and by sales of our receivables as a result of challenges currently affecting the economy of the united states and other regions of the world our customers who are concentrated in the semiconductor sector have experienced and may continue to experience adverse changes in their business and as a result may delay purchasing our products and services or delay or default on their payment obligations if our customers are not successful in generating sufficient revenue or are precluded from securing financing they may not be able to pay or may delay payment of accounts receivable that are owed to us although these obligations are generally not cancelable our customers’ inability to fulfill payment obligations may adversely affect our cash flow additionally our customers may seek to renegotiate preexisting contractual commitments though we have not yet experienced a material level of defaults any material payment default by our customers or significant reductions in existing contractual commitments would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results 

 

we have entered into agreements whereby we may transfer accounts receivable to certain financial institutions on a nonrecourse or limitedrecourse basis these transfers are recorded as sales and accounted for in accordance with sfas no 140 “accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities” during fiscal 2008 we transferred accounts receivable net of the losses on the sale of the 

receivables totaling 522 million which approximated fair value to financial institutions on a nonrecourse basis as compared to 2154 million during fiscal 2007 and 1806 million during fiscal 2006 as a result of the credit losses recorded by banks during 2008 and the current financial challenges experienced by banks a number of banks have become less willing to purchase assets because of capital constraints and concerns about overexposure to the technology sector in addition the change in our license mix will result in an increased number of subscription licenses and a decrease in the sale of receivables to financial institutions so we expect a reduced level of proceeds from the sale of receivables throughout fiscal 2009 

 

due to the lower order levels and the reduced level of sale of receivables we do not expect positive net cash flows from operating activities in fiscal 2009 

 

during fiscal 2008 we initiated the 2008 restructuring plan to decrease costs by reducing our workforce across the company and by consolidating facilities where the workforce reductions resulted in excess office space this restructuring plan is intended to decrease costs by reducing our workforce throughout the company by at least 625 positions and we recorded restructuring and other charges of 464 million during fiscal 2008 as of january 3 2009 we had made payments in connection with the 2008 restructuring plan in the amount of 156 million we expect substantially all termination benefits to be paid by january 2 2010 we expect ongoing annual savings of approximately 1500 million related to the 2008 restructuring plan 

 

cash flows from investing activities 

 

our primary investing activities consisted of 

 

  

net cash used for investing activities increased 185 million during fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 and decreased 34 million during fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 due to the following 

 

 

 

in january 2007 we completed the sale of certain land and buildings in san jose california for a sales price of 465 million in cash concurrently with the sale we leased back from the purchaser all available space in the buildings during the lease term we constructed an additional building located on our san jose california campus to replace the buildings we sold in this transaction we expect to use approximately 56 million in cash in fiscal 2009 in connection with the completion of construction of this new building we expect decreased cash payments for property plant and equipment during fiscal 2009 as the new building is complete 

 

during fiscal 2008 we purchased approximately 43 million shares of mentor graphics common stock for 624 million in connection with our proposed acquisition of mentor graphics after the announcement of our withdrawal of the proposed acquisition of mentor graphics we sold our entire equity interest in mentor graphics at a loss of 94 million 

in connection with our acquisitions completed before january 3 2009 we may be obligated to pay up to an aggregate of 510 million in cash during the next 44 months if certain defined performance goals are achieved in full which would be expensed as compensation expense in our consolidated statements of operations 

 

we expect to continue our investing activities including purchasing property plant and equipment purchasing intangible assets purchasing software licenses and making longterm equity investments 

 

cash flows from financing activities 

 

financing cash flows during fiscal 2008 consisted primarily of purchases of treasury stock the repurchase of our 2023 notes and the issuance of common stock under certain employee plans 

 

net cash used for financing activities increased by 2733 million during fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 and decreased 638 million during fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 due to the following 

 

 

 

the decrease in proceeds from the issuance of common stock during fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 is due to fewer stock option exercises resulting from lower stock prices the decrease in purchases of treasury stock during fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 is due to a lower cost to repurchase shares 

 

we record a gain or loss on reissuance of treasury stock based on the total proceeds received in the transaction during fiscal 2008 we recorded losses on the reissuance of treasury stock of 1106 million as a component of retained earnings 

 

as of january 3 2009 we have 8544 million remaining under the stock repurchase programs authorized by our board of directors 

 

other factors affecting liquidity and capital resources 

 

income taxes 

 

given the escalating challenges in the global capital markets during fiscal 2008 we decided to repatriate 2500 million of earnings from a foreign subsidiary to the united states that had previously been considered to be indefinitely reinvested outside the united states and for which deferred taxes had not been previously provided we currently expect to repatriate an additional 672 million of previously untaxed earnings from foreign subsidiaries in future periods we expect that our available net operating losses and foreign tax credits will offset any current year income taxes related to the dividends paid during fiscal 2008 we intend to indefinitely reinvest the remainder of our undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries of approximately 378 million as of january 3 2009 to meet both the working capital and longterm capital needs of its subsidiaries and of cadence the unrecognized deferred tax liability for these indefinitely reinvested foreign earnings was approximately 155 million as of january 3 2009 

during fiscal 2008 we also increased our valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets by 3329 million because of the uncertainty regarding their ultimate realization we record a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that we are more likely than not to realize the valuation allowance will not result in current or future tax payments for additional description of the valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets see the discussion under the heading “results of operations — provision for income taxes” above 

 

the irs and other tax authorities regularly examine our income tax returns and we have received a rar in which the irs proposed to assess a tax deficiency for additional description of our irs examinations see the discussion under the heading “results of operations — provision for income taxes” above 

 

as of january 3 2009 we had current income tax liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits of 57 million as of january 3 2009 we had longterm income tax liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits of 2880 million for additional information on the income tax liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits see the discussion under the heading “contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements” below

we received net proceeds of approximately 4870 million after transaction fees of approximately 130 million including 120 million of underwriting discounts a portion of the net proceeds totaling 2285 million was used to purchase 1896 million principal amount of our 2023 notes 

 

holders may convert their convertible senior notes prior to maturity upon the occurrence of one of the following events

the initial conversion rate for the convertible senior notes is 472813 shares of our common stock per 1000 principal amount of convertible senior notes equivalent to a conversion price of approximately 2115 per share of our common stock upon conversion a holder will receive the sum of the daily settlement amounts calculated on a proportionate basis for each day during a specified observation period following the conversion date the daily settlement amount during each date of the observation period consists of 

 

  

in addition if a fundamental change occurs prior to maturity and provided that our stock price is greater than 1800 per share the conversion rate will increase by an additional amount of up to 827 per share for a holder that elects to convert its convertible senior notes in connection with such fundamental change which amount will be paid entirely in cash a fundamental change is any transaction or event whether by means of an exchange offer liquidation tender offer consolidation merger combination reclassification recapitalization or otherwise in 

which more than 50 of our common stock is exchanged for converted into acquired for or constitutes solely the right to receive consideration no fundamental change will have occurred if at least 90 of the consideration received consists of shares of common stock or depositary receipts representing such shares that are 

 

  

as of january 3 2009 none of the conditions allowing the holders of the convertible senior notes to convert had been met 

 

interest on the convertible senior notes began accruing in december 2006 and is payable semiannually each december 15th and june 15th 

 

concurrently with the issuance of the convertible senior notes we entered into hedge transactions with various parties whereby we have the option to purchase up to 236 million shares of our common stock at a price of 2115 per share subject to adjustment these options expire on december 15 2011 in the case of the 2011 notes and december 15 2013 in the case of the 2013 notes and must be settled in net shares the aggregate cost of these hedge transactions was 1198 million and has been recorded as a reduction to stockholders’ equity in accordance with emerging issues task force or eitf no 0019 “accounting for derivative financial instruments indexed to and potentially settled in a company’s own stock” the estimated fair value of the hedges acquired in connection with the issuance of the convertible senior notes was 116 million as of january 3 2009 subsequent changes in the fair value of these hedges will not be recognized as long as the instruments remain classified as equity 

 

in separate transactions we also sold warrants to various parties for the purchase of up to 236 million shares of our common stock at a price of 3150 per share in a private placement pursuant to section 42 of the securities act the warrants expire on various dates from february 2012 through april 2012 in the case of the 2011 notes and february 2014 through april 2014 in the case of the 2013 notes and must be settled in net shares we received 394 million in cash proceeds from the sale of these warrants which has been recorded as a reduction to stockholders’ equity in accordance with eitf no 0019 the estimated fair value of the warrants sold in connection with the issuance of the convertible senior notes was 75 million as of january 3 2009 subsequent changes in the fair value of these warrants will not be recognized as long as the instruments remain classified as equity the warrants will be included in diluted earnings per share or eps to the extent the impact is dilutive 

 

zero coupon zero yield senior convertible notes due 2023 

 

in august 2003 we issued 4200 million principal amount of our 2023 notes to two initial purchasers in a private placement pursuant to section 42 of the securities act for resale to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to rule 144a of the securities act we received net proceeds of 4064 million after transaction fees of 136 million that were recorded in other longterm assets and were being amortized to interest expense using the straightline method over five years in connection with the issuance of the convertible senior notes in december 2006 we repurchased 1896 million principal amount of the 2023 notes and in august 2008 we repurchased 2302 million principal amount of the 2023 notes upon election of the holders of the 2023 notes pursuant to the terms of the 2023 notes for total consideration of 2308 million reducing the outstanding 2023 notes balance to 02 million as of january 3 2009 concurrently with the issuance of the 2023 notes we entered into hedge and warrant transactions all of which expired during fiscal 2008 and no settlement was required 

contractual obligations 

 

a summary of our contractual obligations as of january 3 2009 is as follows 

 

 

 

 

 

  

with respect to purchase obligations that are cancelable by us the table includes the amount that would have been payable if we had canceled the obligation as of january 3 2009 or the earliest cancellation date 

 

in connection with our acquisitions completed before january 3 2009 we may be obligated to pay up to an aggregate of 510 million in cash during the next 44 months if certain predefined performance goals are achieved in full 

 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

 

as of january 3 2009 we did not have any significant offbalance sheet arrangements as defined in item 303a4ii of sec regulation sk 

 

new accounting standards 

 

in may 2008 the fasb issued fsp apb 141 “accounting for convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion including partial cash settlement” which will require us to recognize additional noncash interest expense related to our convertible senior notes in our consolidated statements of operations fsp apb 141 is effective for fiscal 2009 and is required to be applied retrospectively for all periods for which our convertible senior notes were outstanding before the date of adoption fsp apb 141 will have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition particularly with respect to interest expense ratios commonly referred to by lenders and could potentially hinder our ability to raise capital through the issuance of debt or equity 

securities we expect interest expense to increase during fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 due to the inclusion of approximately 200 million of noncash interest expense resulting from our adoption of fsp apb 141 in addition fsp apb 141 requires retrospective adoption which will require us to adjust our consolidated financial statements for prior years to reflect increased interest expense in each of those years 

 

in april 2008 the fasb issued fsp fas no 1423 “determination of the useful life of intangible assets” fsp fas 1423 amends the factors an entity should consider in developing renewal or extension assumptions used in determining the useful life of recognized intangible assets under sfas no 142 this new guidance applies prospectively to intangible assets that are acquired individually or with a group of other assets in business combinations and asset acquisitions fsp fas 1423 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after december 15 2008 early adoption is prohibited since this guidance will be applied prospectively on adoption there will be no impact to our consolidated financial statements 

 

in march 2008 the fasb issued sfas no 161 “disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities — an amendment of fasb statement no 133” which requires companies with derivative instruments to disclose information that should enable financial statement users to understand how and why a company uses derivative instruments how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under sfas no 133 “accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities” and how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect a company’s financial position financial performance and cash flows sfas no 161 is effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal 2009 because sfas no 161 only requires additional disclosure the adoption will not impact our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

 

in december 2007 the fasb issued sfas no 141r “business combinations” and sfas no 160 “noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements an amendment of accounting research bulletin no 51” sfas no 141r will change how business acquisitions are accounted for and will impact financial statements both on the acquisition date and in subsequent periods sfas no 160 will change the accounting and reporting for minority interests which will be recharacterized as noncontrolling interests and classified as a component of equity sfas no 141r and sfas no 160 are effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2008 early adoption is not permitted we are currently evaluating the impact that sfas no 141r and sfas no 160 will have on our consolidated financial statements 

 

in september 2006 the fasb issued sfas no 157 “fair value measurements” which defines fair value establishes guidelines for measuring fair value and expands disclosures regarding fair value measurements sfas no 157 does not require any new fair value measurements but rather eliminates inconsistencies in guidance found in various prior accounting pronouncements sfas no 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after november 15 2007 however on february 12 2008 the fasb issued fsp fas no 1572 which delays the effective date of sfas no 157 for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis at least annually to fiscal years beginning after november 15 2008 and interim periods within those fiscal years for items within the scope of fsp fas no 1572 we adopted sfas no 157 at the beginning of fiscal 2008 except as it applies to those nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities as described in fsp fas no 1572 we adopted sfas no 157 for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities on the first day of fiscal 2009 since the adoption of sfas no 157 for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities will be applied prospectively on adoption there will be no impact to our consolidated financial statements 

 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

 

interest rate risk 

 

our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our portfolio of cash and cash equivalents while we are exposed to interest rate fluctuations in many of the world’s leading industrialized countries our interest income and expense is most sensitive to fluctuations in the general level of united states interest rates in this regard changes in united states interest rates affect the interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents and costs associated with foreign currency hedges 

we invest in high quality credit issuers and by policy limit the amount of our credit exposure to any one issuer as part of our policy our first priority is to reduce the risk of principal loss consequently we seek to preserve our invested funds by limiting default risk market risk and reinvestment risk we mitigate default risk by investing in only high quality credit securities that we believe to have low credit risk and by positioning our portfolio to respond appropriately to a significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor the shortterm interestbearing portfolio of cash and cash equivalents includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity 

 

all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase are considered to be cash equivalents investments with maturities greater than three months are classified as availableforsale and are considered to be shortterm investments the carrying value of our interestbearing instruments approximated fair value as of january 3 2009 the following table presents the carrying value and related weighted average interest rates for our interestbearing instruments which are all classified as cash and cash equivalents on our consolidated balance sheet as of january 3 2009 

 

 

 

foreign currency risk 

 

most of our revenue expenses and material business activity are transacted in the united states dollar however certain of our operations include transactions in foreign currencies and therefore we benefit from a weaker dollar and in certain countries where we invoice customers in the local currency we are adversely affected by a stronger dollar relative to major currencies worldwide the primary effect of foreign currency transactions on our results of operations from a weakening united states dollar is an increase in revenue offset by a smaller increase in expenses conversely the primary effect of foreign currency transactions on our results of operations from a strengthening united states dollar is a reduction in revenue offset by a smaller reduction in expenses 

 

we enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts with financial institutions to protect against currency exchange risks associated with existing assets and liabilities a foreign currency forward exchange contract acts as a hedge by increasing in value when underlying assets decrease in value or underlying liabilities increase in value due to changes in foreign exchange rates conversely a foreign currency forward exchange contract decreases in value when underlying assets increase in value or underlying liabilities decrease in value due to changes in foreign exchange rates these forward contracts are not designated as accounting hedges under sfas no 133 and therefore the unrealized gains and losses are recognized in other income net in advance of the actual foreign currency cash flows with the fair value of these forward contracts being recorded as accrued liabilities or other current assets 

 

our policy governing hedges of foreign currency risk does not allow us to use forward contracts for trading purposes our forward contracts generally have maturities of 90 days or less the effectiveness of our hedging program depends on our ability to estimate future asset and liability exposures we enter into currency forward exchange contracts based on estimated future asset and liability exposures recognized gains and losses with respect to our current hedging activities will ultimately depend on how accurately we are able to match the amount of currency forward exchange contracts with actual underlying asset and liability exposures 

 

the following table provides information as of january 3 2009 about our forward foreign currency contracts the information is provided in united states dollar equivalent amounts the table presents the notional amounts at contract exchange rates and the weighted average contractual foreign currency exchange rates expressed as units of 

the foreign currency per united states dollar which in some cases may not be the market convention for quoting a particular currency all of these forward contracts matured during january 2009 

 

 

 

while we actively monitor our foreign currency risks there can be no assurance that our foreign currency hedging activities will substantially offset the impact of fluctuations in currency exchange rates on our results of operations cash flows and financial position 

 

equity price risk 

 

1375 convertible senior notes due 2011 and 1500 convertible senior notes due 2013 

 

in december 2006 we issued 2500 million principal amount of 1375 convertible senior notes due 2011 or the 2011 notes and 2500 million of 1500 convertible senior notes due 2013 or the 2013 notes and collectively the convertible senior notes to three initial purchasers in a private placement pursuant to section 42 of the securities act for resale to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to sec rule 144a concurrently with the issuance of the convertible senior notes we entered into hedge transactions with various parties and in separate transactions sold warrants to various parties to reduce the potential dilution from the conversion of the convertible senior notes and to mitigate any negative effect such conversion may have on the price of our common stock for additional description of the convertible senior notes including the hedge and warrants transactions see the discussion under the heading “liquidity and capital resources – factors affecting liquidity and capital resources” under item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” above 

 

investments 

 

we have a portfolio of equity investments that includes marketable equity securities and nonmarketable equity securities our equity investments are made primarily in connection with our strategic investment program under our strategic investment program from time to time we make cash investments in companies with technologies that are potentially strategically important to us 

 

the fair value of our portfolio of availableforsale marketable equity securities which are included in shortterm investments on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets was 36 million as of january 3 2009 and 149 million as of december 29 2007 while we actively monitor these investments we do not currently engage in any hedging activities to reduce or eliminate equity price risk with respect to these equity investments accordingly we could lose all or part of our investment portfolio of marketable equity securities if there is an adverse change in the market prices of the companies we invest in 

our investments in nonmarketable equity securities would be negatively affected by an adverse change in equity market prices although the impact cannot be directly quantified such a change or any negative change in the financial performance or prospects of the companies whose nonmarketable securities we own would harm the ability of these companies to raise additional capital and the likelihood of our being able to realize any gains or return of our investments through liquidity events such as initial public offerings acquisitions and private sales these types of investments involve a high degree of risk and there can be no assurance that any company we invest in will grow or will be successful or that we will be able to liquidate a particular investment when desired accordingly we could lose all or part of our investment 

 

our investments in nonmarketable equity securities had a carrying amount of 187 million as of january 3 2009 and 262 million as of december 29 2007 if we determine that an otherthantemporary decline in fair value exists for a nonmarketable equity security we write down the investment to its fair value and record the related writedown as an investment loss in our consolidated statements of operations 

 




 item 9 changes in and disagreements with accountants on accounting and financial disclosure

 item 9a controls and procedures 

 

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

 

we carried out an evaluation required by rule 13a15 of the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended or the exchange act under the supervision and with the participation of our management including our chief executive officer or ceo and our chief financial officer or cfo of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rules 13a15e and 15d15e under the exchange act as of january 3 2009 

 

the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures included a review of our processes and the effect on the information generated for use in this annual report on form 10k in the course of this evaluation we sought to identify any material weaknesses in our disclosure controls and procedures to determine whether we had identified any acts of fraud involving personnel who have a significant role in our disclosure controls and procedures and to confirm that any necessary corrective action including process improvements was taken this type of evaluation is performed every fiscal quarter so that our conclusions concerning the effectiveness of these controls can be reported in our periodic reports filed with the sec we intend to maintain these disclosure controls and procedures modifying them as circumstances warrant 

 

based on their evaluation as of january 3 2009 our ceo and cfo have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by us in our reports filed or submitted under the exchange act i is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the sec’s rules and forms and ii is accumulated and communicated to our management including the ceo and cfo as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure as previously disclosed in this annual report on form 10k we appointed a new ceo effective january 8 2009 therefore it should be noted that the certification of the ceo as to our disclosure controls and procedures as of january 3 2009 is necessarily based in part on an evaluation of facts that existed before he served in the capacity of ceo 

 

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

 

during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 in connection with the restatement of our previously issued financial statements for the periods ended march 29 2008 and june 28 2008 and our assessment of our disclosure controls and procedures management concluded that as of march 29 2008 june 28 2008 and september 27 2008 our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective and that we had a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting we engaged in a review of our internal control over financial reporting as described below and based on that review our management believes that the changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 described below materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting we believe the remediation measures described below have been successful in the remediation of the material weakness previously identified and have further strengthened and enhanced our internal control over financial reporting see also “management’s report on internal control over financial reporting” below 

 

remediation of previously reported material weakness 

 

during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 consistent with good corporate governance practices the audit committee of our board of directors or audit committee with the assistance of special counsel and other advisors conducted an investigation of the events that led to the restatement of our previously issued financial statements for the quarterly periods ended march 29 2008 and june 28 2008 the restatements are more fully described in the explanatory note to amendment no 1 to the quarterly reports on form 10qa for the periods ended march 29 2008 and june 28 2008 and in note 2 to the condensed consolidated financial statements therein upon the completion of this investigation the audit committee concluded that the circumstances that led to the restatement were not the result of illegal conduct on the part of any of our directors officers or other employees we also carried 

out as of september 27 2008 an evaluation required by rule 13a15 of the exchange act of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures under the supervision and with the participation of our management including the chief of staff of our interim office of the chief executive or ioce chief of staff who performed functions similar to a principal executive officer during a portion of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 and our cfo in the course of that evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures our management concluded that as of march 29 2008 june 28 2008 and september 27 2008 our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective and that we had a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting 

 

a material weakness is a deficiency or a combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting that creates a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis our management concluded that there was a material weakness in our internal controls over the application of revenue recognition criteria required by sop 972 “software revenue recognition” in the context of multipleelement software arrangements the material weakness related to both the insufficient design and ineffective operation of certain internal controls over the recognition of revenue from term license agreements specifically the material weakness was comprised of the following components 

 

  

as a result of the material weakness in internal control over financial reporting our management did not previously detect that revenue from three term license arrangements was improperly recognized in the quarterly periods ended march 29 2008 and june 28 2008 and preliminarily recognized in the quarterly period ended september 27 2008 which resulted in the restatement of our previously issued condensed consolidated financial statements for the three month period ended march 29 2008 and for the three and six month periods ended june 28 2008 and adjustments to the preliminary condensed consolidated financial statements for the three and nine month periods ended september 27 2008 to address the material weakness described above we implemented enhancements to our internal controls specifically we took the following actions during the last fiscal quarter ended january 3 2009 which our management believes have improved and will continue to improve our internal control over financial reporting and our disclosure controls and procedures 

 

  

our management believes that the actions described above remediated the material weakness we identified and strengthened our internal control over financial reporting 

 

inherent limitations on effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures 

 

our management including the ceo and cfo does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all error and all fraud an internal control framework no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of internal control are met further the design of internal control must reflect the fact that there are 

resource constraints and the benefits of the controls must be considered relative to their costs while our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance of their effectiveness because of the inherent limitations in internal control no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within cadence have been detected

factors driving the electronic design automation industry 

 

communications computing and consumer electronics markets drove the growth in the electronics industry for most of the past decade however in recent years the consumer market has been the fastest growing end market for electronics and the most influential in setting requirements for timetomarket low cost miniaturization and increasing functionality these market and technology forces pose major challenges for the global electronics design community 

 

during 2007 we saw increasing pressures on research and development budgets in our customer base due to the deceleration of growth in the electronics equipment and semiconductor industries and a deteriorating macroeconomic environment semiconductor volumes grew during 2007 fueled by strong consumer demand in traditional and emerging markets but at the same time average selling prices declined 

 

electronic systems companies respond to demand for increased functionality and miniaturization by combining subsystems – such as radio frequency wireless communication or rf video signal processing and 

microprocessors – onto a single silicon chip creating a systemonchip or soc or multiple chips into a single chip package in a format referred to as systeminpackage or sip these trends toward subsystem integration have required chip makers to find solutions to challenges previously addressed by system companies such as verifying systemlevel functionality and hardwaresoftware interoperability 

 

soc designs put many more transistors on each chip increasing the need for tight control over power consumption this is done not only to increase battery life in portable devices but also to minimize energy cost for computing and networking equipment higher power devices generate more heat which further increases both system cost as well as operating expenses for cooling evolving semiconductor manufacturing processes with smaller features transistors and wires and lower supply voltages address both of these issues to some degree but introduce new challenges of their own contemporary portable electronic devices contain chips in which individual features can be as small as 45 nanometers – 451000000ths of a millimeter because of the electrical characteristics of the materials used to construct the transistors which are essentially microscopic switches chips continue to consume power even when transistors in the device are switched off to overcome these and other powerrelated issues specific “low power” design techniques must be developed and are most effective if they are integrated throughout the design flow from logic design and verification through physical implementation 

 

variability in the processes and materials used to manufacture silicon chips have become so pervasive at 65 nanometers and below that traditional connections between design and manufacturing teams are insufficient to ensure chip performance and yield integrating detailed models of the manufacturing process into the chip design environment is desirable so engineers can craft the design to avoid or overcome these manufacturing process variations similarly manufacturing teams can optimize their processes if along with the design they are provided with information about the most critical parts of the chip however sharing information between design and manufacturing processes is complicated because current data formats used to describe the chip design differ from data formats used to describe the manufacturing process and control the manufacturing equipment moreover design and manufacturing often take place within two or more separate companies since multiple companies may participate in the design of the chip and multiple companies may participate in the manufacturing and assembly of the final device 

 

these trends represent significant new challenges for electronics design processes specifically product performance and size requirements of the mobile consumer electronics market require microelectronic systems to be smaller consume less power and provide multiple functions all in one soc or sip package this requires designers to pay close attention to many electrical physical and manufacturing effects that were inconsequential in previous generations of chip designs the design challenge becomes more complex with each new generation of electronics and providers of eda solutions must deliver products that address these technical challenges while improving the efficiency and productivity of the design process 

 

operating segment 

 

our chief operating decision maker is our president and chief executive officer or ceo our ceo reviews our consolidated results within only one operating segment 

 

products 

 

our products are engineered to improve our customers’ design productivity and resulting design quality by providing a comprehensive set of eda design tools product revenues include all fees earned from granting licenses to use our software and from sales and leases of our hardware products and exclude revenues derived from maintenance and services we offer customers three license types for our software perpetual term and subscription see “software licensing arrangements” below for additional discussion of our license types 

 

product revenue was 11040 million or 68 of our total revenue in 2007 9827 million or 66 of our total revenue in 2006 and 8515 million or 64 of our total revenue in 2005 

 

product strategy 

 

with the addition of emerging nanometer design considerations to the already burgeoning set of traditional design tasks complex soc or ic design can no longer be accomplished using a collection of discrete design tools what previously consisted of sequential design activities must be merged and accomplished nearly simultaneously without timeconsuming data translation steps we combine our design technologies into “platforms” for four major 

design activities functional verification digital ic design custom ic design and system interconnect design the four cadence ® design platforms are incisive ® functional verification encounter ® digital ic design virtuoso ® custom design and allegro ® system interconnect design platforms in addition we augment these platform product offerings with a comprehensive set of design for manufacturing or dfm products that service both the digital and custom ic design flows these four platforms together with our dfm products comprise our primary product lines 

 

in order to provide our customers with products that are optimized and scaled to their specific project requirements we introduced three product tiers the “l” tier provides competitive technology for mainstream design projects the “xl” tier is differentiated for more complex and leading edge design projects the “gxl” tier is highly differentiated to address the most complex and challenging design projects in the industry 

 

incisive functional verification platform 

 

the incisive functional verification platform enables our customers to employ enterpriselevel verification process automation including verification planning management and process tracking with coordination of all verification activities across teams of specialists and different execution platforms 

 

the incisive platform is tailored for three customer segments 

 

  

the incisive platform includes verification process automation technologies methodologies and verification intellectual property or vip for many standard protocols the incisive platform is comprised of the following core solutions 

 

  

the incisive plantoclosure methodology and the soc functional verification kit are designed to enable the scalable deployment of best practices by our technical field experts and to mitigate our customers’ language technology and methodology adoption risks 

 

encounter digital ic design platform 

 

the encounter digital ic design platform enables our customers to implement all aspects of their digital nanometerscale designs it is based on a single user interface and unified inmemory data model and is specifically designed to facilitate the analysis and optimization of chip performance power consumption and silicon area and manufacturability throughout our customers’ design processes the encounter platform is comprised of the following core technologies 

 

 3 

  

unlike traditional “frontendbackend” systems the encounter platform does not require customers to perform timeconsuming translations between common tasks such as placement power distribution routing and timing and crosstalk analysis the encounter platform supports hierarchical designs with support for designs containing hundreds of millions of transistors on a single chip since 2005 the encounter platform has been marketed in three tiers encounter l xl and gxl these tiers are scaled to provide customers with technologies tailored to specific degrees of design complexity in the digital ic space 

 

virtuoso custom design platform 

 

the virtuoso custom design platform provides designers with an integrated solution for design creation validation and implementation of siliconaccurate analog custom digital mixedsignal and rf designs while ensuring that these designs are ready for manufacturing through our integrated dfm capabilities 

 

the virtuoso platform reduces design time by providing 

 

  

the latest virtuoso 610 release provides a unified design environment tying together the design layout and verification tasks based on innovative constraintdriven design capabilities which significantly improve our customers’ productivity the endtoend simulation and verification technology called “multimode simulation” is integrated into the unified environment enabling a complete designtoverification methodology 

 

the virtuoso 610 platform relies on the openaccess tm database described below in “third party programs and initiatives” which provides a common foundation for the designers as they move through the design cycle and is also a mechanism to interoperate with applications developed by partners and customers 

 

the virtuoso l xl and gxl offerings provide designers the ability to choose the right products to match their needs for custom design ranging from the simplest entrylevel component design to the most complex dfmaware soc designs 

 

allegro system interconnect design platform 

 

the allegro system interconnect design platform enables design teams to design highperformance electronic products across the domains of ic package and printed circuit board or pcb reducing cost and time to market the system interconnect – between inputoutput buffers and across ics packages and pcbs – can be optimized through the platform’s codesign methodology reducing both hardware costs and design cycles designers use the allegro platform’s constraintdriven methodology and advanced capabilities for design capture signal integrity and physical implementation silicon designin kits speed time to market by allowing ic companies to shorten new device adoption time and allowing systems companies to accelerate pcb system design cycles in 2007 we shipped our next generation pcb design products that include our new global route environment technology as part of the allegro 160 release we also expanded sales of our ic packaging and sip products the allegro family products are marketed in three product tiers allegro l xl and gxl 

the system interconnect design product group includes the allegro system interconnect design platform the orcad ® product line of pcb design products which are engineered for individual or small design team productivity and a family of ic packaging and sip technologies the orcad product line is marketed worldwide through a network of resellers 

 

design for manufacturing 

 

with the advent of finer geometries in silicon manufacturing technologies 65 nanometer 45 nanometer and below semiconductor companies are increasingly concerned about manufacturability of their designs the physical layout of each ic requires detailed analysis and optimization to ensure that the design can be manufactured in volume while performing as expected 

 

cadence’s strategy is to integrate silicon foundryendorsed modelbased manufacturability analysis and signoff into the proven ic design implementation flows from both the virtuoso as well as the encounter platforms the benefits of this integrated manufacturability design flow include reduction of catastrophic and parametric yield issues and enablement of design implementation for maximized performance 

 

some of our products that deliver dfm capabilities for nanometer soc design include 

 

  

kits 

 

today’s growing silicon complexity creates an array of design challenges for semiconductor and systems design teams among these challenges is the application of eda technologies to overcome design hurdles in certain key markets driving the semiconductor industry such as the wireless and networking segments cadence kits are designed to allow companies in these sectors to achieve shorter more predictable design cycles and greater design productivity by greatly simplifying the application and integration of eda technologies to address major design challenges in the analog mixedsignal rf sip low power and soc functional verification markets 

 

a cadence kit assembles technologies from our broad portfolio into readytouse design flows enhanced by application specific design methodologies expert knowledge and best practices and applied to a segment representative ic design the kits accelerate the adoption of latest design methodologies and offer customers improved productivity in 2007 we introduced the low power kit and the soc functional verification kit 

 

verification and applicationspecific programming services 

 

we offer verification and applicationspecific programming or asp services which provide customers with consulting services project services andor complete turnkey services for verification acceleration and system 

emulation quickcycles allows customers access to our palladium simulation acceleration and emulation products either on the customer internet site or remotely over a highspeed secure network connection 

 

third party programs and initiatives 

 

we recognize that certain of our customers may also use internallydeveloped design tools or design tools provided by other eda companies as well as ip available from multiple suppliers we support the integration of third party design products through participation in the openaccess initiative the connections ® and openchoice ip programs openaccess is a fullfeatured eda database that supports access and manipulation of its internal eda data via a fully documented and freely available programming interface this provides an open application program interface through which applications developed by our customers by their other eda vendors or by university research groups can all operate within a single database and with our products we have licensed the openaccess database to the openaccess coalition which is operated by the silicon integration initiative or si2 an organization of eda electronic system and semiconductor industry leaders focused on improving productivity and reducing cost in creating and producing integrated silicon systems 

 

the connections program provides member companies with access to our products to ensure that our products work well with third party tools the openchoice ip program was instituted to enable interoperability and facilitate open collaboration with leading providers of library processor memory core and verification ip to build validate and deliver accurate models optimized for cadence design and verification solutions the program aims to ensure ip quality and provide our customers with access to a broad ip portfolio that works with our products a key component of the openchoice program is to assist and support library providers in the integration of our design and verification products and model formats into customerowned tooling or cot library solutions 

 

in 2007 the power forward initiative membership grew to 24 electronics industry leaders who recognized the urgent need for an automated poweraware design infrastructure to facilitate the production of ics that consume significantly less power this group participated in the refinement and standardization of the common power format or cpf cpf is a specification language that holistically captures lowpower design intent so that it can be communicated consistently throughout the ic design process we have contributed the cpf specification to si2 which manages the standardization maintenance and distribution of cpf for the benefit of the electronics industry 

 

in addition we work with vendors of applicationspecific integrated circuits or asics to ensure predictable and smooth handoff of design data from mutual customers to asic implementation these programs foster relationships throughout the silicon design chain with leading ip partners silicon manufacturers and library provider partners to support both asic and cot solutions for our customers they are integral to providing complete design chain solutions to ic and electronic systems designers who depend on coordinated offerings from multiple suppliers 

 

maintenance 

 

we provide technical support to our customers to facilitate their use of our software and hardware products a high level of customer service and support is critical to the adoption and successful use of our products we have a global customer support organization and specialized field application engineering teams located in each of our operating regions to provide assistance to customers where and when they need it 

 

standard maintenance support includes three major components our sourcelink ® online support portal which provides 24 hour access to realtime technical information on our products contact center support telephone email and web access to our support engineers and software updates periodic updates with regressiontested critical fixes and updated functionality available via cds or secure internet download 

 

maintenance is offered to customers as an integral noncancelable component of our subscription license agreements or as a separate agreement subject to annual renewal for our term and perpetual license customers 

 

some of our customers have relocated or expanded the presence of their design teams away from their headquarters or historical locations to locations in emerging growth regions accordingly to provide responsive and effective support for these customers we expect to continue expanding the presence of our own support and application engineering teams in these emerging growth regions 

maintenance revenue was 3852 million or 24 of our total revenue in 2007 3663 million or 25 of our total revenue in 2006 and 3515 million or 26 of our total revenue in 2005 we expect that maintenance revenue in 2008 will be generated predominantly from backlog 

 

services 

 

we offer a number of feebased services including engineering and education services related to ic design and methodology these services may be sold separately or sold and performed in conjunction with the sale lease or license of our products 

 

services revenue was 1258 million or 8 of our total revenue in 2007 1349 million or 9 of our total revenue in 2006 and 1262 million or 9 of our total revenue in 2005 

 

engineering services 

 

we offer engineering services and reusable design technologies to aid customers with the design of complex ics and the implementation of design capabilities we focus our offerings primarily on soc devices including both asics and applicationspecific standard parts and on analog and mixedsignal ics the customers for these services primarily consist of semiconductor and systems companies developing products for the communications computing and consumer markets we offer engineering capabilities to assist customers from product concept through volume manufacturing 

 

we also make our design ip portfolio available to customers as part of our technology and services solutions these reusable design and methodology components enable us to more efficiently deliver our services and allow our customers to reduce the design complexity and time to market for the development of complex socs 

 

in our design and methodology service practices we leverage our cumulative experience and knowledge of design techniques and leading practices with many customers and different design environments to improve our own service teams’ and our customers’ productivity we work with customers using outsourcing consultative and collaborative models depending on their projects and needs our virtual computeraided design or vcad model enables our engineering teams at one or more of our locations to virtually work “sidebyside” with our customers’ teams located elsewhere during the course of their design and engineering projects through a secure private network infrastructure 

 

through collaboration with our customers we are able to design advanced ics and gain direct and early visibility to industry design issues that may not be addressed adequately by today’s eda technologies this enables us to accelerate the development of new software technology and products to meet the market’s current and future design requirements 

 

education services 

 

our education services offerings include internet classroom and custom courses the content of which ranges from how to use the most recent features of our eda products to instruction in the latest ic design techniques the primary focus of education services is to accelerate our customers’ path to productivity in the use of cadence products and increase awareness of the total solution required for engineering success 

 

marketing and sales 

 

we generally use a direct sales force consisting of sales people and applications engineers to market our products and provide maintenance and services to existing and prospective customers applications engineers provide technical presales and postsales support for software products due to the complexity of many of our eda products and the electronic design process in general the sales cycle is generally long requiring three to six months or more during the sales cycle our direct sales force generally provides technical presentations product demonstrations and support for onsite customer evaluation of our software we also use traditional marketing approaches to promote our products and services including advertising direct mail telemarketing trade shows public relations and the internet as eda products mature and become widely understood by the marketplace we selectively utilize value added resellers to broaden our reach and reduce cost of sales all orcad and selected incisive products are primarily marketed through these channels with respect to international sales we generally market and support our products and services through our subsidiaries 

software licensing arrangements 

 

we sell software using three license types subscription term and perpetual customers who prefer to license technology for a specified limited period of time will choose either a subscription or term license and customers who prefer to have the right to use the technology continuously without time restriction will choose a perpetual license customers who desire rights to remix in new technology during the life of the contract will select a subscription license which allows them limited access to unspecified new technology on a whenandifavailable basis as opposed to a term or perpetual license which does not include remix rights to new technology payment terms for subscription and term licenses generally provide for payments to be made in installments over the license period and payment terms for perpetual licenses generally are net 30 days 

 

our revenue recognition depends on a number of contractspecific terms and conditions including the license type payment terms creditworthiness of the customer and other factors as more fully described in this annual report under the heading “critical accounting estimates” under item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” revenue associated with subscription licenses is recognized over multiple periods during the license term whereas product revenue associated with term and perpetual licenses is generally recognized upon the later of the effective date of the license or delivery of the product assuming all other criteria for revenue recognition have been met the amount of product revenue recognized from backlog varies from quarter to quarter for the past three years the amount of product revenue recognized from backlog generally has been approximately twothirds of total product revenue 

 

our revenue and results of operations may miss expectations due to a shortfall in product revenue generated from current transactions or variance in the actual mix of license types executed in any given period and due to other contractspecific terms and conditions as discussed above we are subject to greater credit risk on subscription and term licenses as compared to perpetual licenses due to the installment payment terms generally associated with those license types otherwise the particular risks of one license type versus another type do not vary considerably 

 

from time to time we sell receivables generated by our licenses with installment payment terms to third party financing institutions on a nonrecourse or limitedrecourse basis 

 

for a further description of our license agreements revenue recognition policies and results of operations please refer to the discussion under the heading “critical accounting estimates” under item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” 

 

research and development 

 

our investment in research and development was 4940 million in 2007 4601 million in 2006 and 3907 million in 2005 

 

the primary areas of our research and development include soc design the design of silicon devices in the nanometer range highperformance ic packaging sip and pcb design systemlevel modeling and verification highperformance logic verification technology and hardwaresoftware coverification because the electronics industry combines rapid innovation with rapidly increasing design and manufacturing complexity we make significant investments in enhancing our current products as well as creating new products and technologies and integrating those products and technologies together into segmented solutions 

 

our future performance depends largely on our ability to maintain and enhance our current product development and commercialization to develop acquire or operate with new products from third parties and to develop solutions that meet increasingly demanding productivity quality predictability and cost requirements in addition to our product development team which focuses on new and existing products we maintain cadence laboratories an advanced research group responsible for exploring new technologies moving those technologies into product development and maintaining strong industry relationships 

 

manufacturing and distribution 

 

our software production consists of configuring the customer’s order recording the product electronically or on cdrom and producing unique access keys that allow customers to use licensed products software and documentation are primarily distributed to customers by secure electronic delivery user manuals and other 

documentation are generally available by secure electronic delivery or on cdrom but are occasionally supplied in hard copy format 

 

cadence performs final assembly and test of its hardware verification acceleration and emulation products in san jose california subcontractors manufacture all major subassemblies including all individual pcbs and custom ics and supply them for qualification and testing prior to their incorporation into the assembled product 

 

proprietary technology 

 

our success depends in part upon our proprietary technology we generally rely on patents copyrights trademarks trade secret laws licenses and restrictive agreements to establish and protect our proprietary rights in technology and products many of our products include software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties we may have to seek new licenses or renew existing licenses for this third party software and other intellectual property in the future as part of performing design and methodology services for customers our design and methodology services business uses certain software and other intellectual property licensed from third parties including that of our competitors 

 

competition 

 

we compete in the eda market for products and maintenance primarily with three companies synopsys inc mentor graphics corporation and magma design automation inc we also compete with numerous smaller eda companies with manufacturers of electronic devices that have developed or have the capability to develop their own eda products and with numerous electronics design and consulting companies we generally compete on the basis of product quality product features level of integration or compatibility with other tools price payment terms and maintenance offerings 

 

our maintenance business flows directly from our product business the competitive issues associated with our maintenance business are substantially similar to those for our product business in that every maintenance contract is the direct result of a product contract and once we have entered into a product contract maintenance is generally purchased by the customer to ensure access to bug fixes and service releases as and when they are made available and other continued support 

 

certain competitive factors in the design and methodology services business as described herein differ from those of the products and maintenance businesses while we do compete with other eda companies in the design and methodology services business our principal competitors are independent design and methodology service businesses these companies vary greatly in focus geographic location capability cost structure and pricing in addition manufacturers of electronic devices may be reluctant to purchase services from independent vendors such as cadence because they wish to promote their own internal design departments we compete with these companies by focusing on the design of complex analog and digital ics it is our strategy to use design and methodology services as a differentiator to further promote our products and maintenance businesses 

 

backlog 

 

our backlog on december 29 2007 was approximately 20 billion as compared to approximately 19 billion on december 30 2006 backlog consists of revenue to be recognized in future fiscal periods after december 29 2007 from a variety of license types which generally include but are not limited to 

 

  

the substantial majority of our backlog is generated by our product and maintenance businesses because customer licenses generally include both product and maintenance components historically we have not experienced significant cancellations of our contracts with customers however we occasionally reschedule the required completion dates of design and methodology services contracts which at times defers revenue recognition 

under those contracts beyond the original expected completion date changes in customer license types or payment terms also can impact the timing of revenue recognition 

 

revenue seasonality 

 

historically orders and revenue have been lowest in our first quarter and highest in our fourth quarter with a material decline between the fourth quarter of one year and the first quarter of the next year we expect the first quarter will remain our lowest quarter for orders and revenues 

 

international operations 

 

we have approximately 60 sales offices design centers and research and development facilities located around the world we consider customer sales and support requirements the availability of a skilled workforce and costs and efficiencies among other relative benefits when determining what operations to locate internationally for additional information regarding our international operations see the discussion under the heading “ the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations and other risks to our international operations may seriously harm our financial condition” in item 1a “risk factors” and note 22 to our consolidated financial statements 

 

employees 

 

as of december 29 2007 we employed approximately 5300 individuals with approximately 2000 in sales services marketing support and manufacturing activities approximately 2600 in product research and development and approximately 700 in management administration and finance none of our employees is represented by a labor union and we have experienced no work stoppages we believe that our employee relations are good 

 




 item 1a risk factors 

 

our business faces many risks described below are what we believe to be the material risks that we face if any of the events or circumstances described in the following risks actually occurs our business financial condition or results of operations could suffer 

 

risks related to our business 

 

we are subject to the cyclical nature of the integrated circuit and electronics systems industries and any downturn in these industries may reduce our revenue 

 

purchases of our products and services are dependent upon the commencement of new design projects by ic manufacturers and electronics systems companies the ic and electronics systems industries are cyclical and are characterized by constant and rapid technological change rapid product obsolescence and price erosion evolving standards short product life cycles and wide fluctuations in product supply and demand 

 

the ic and electronics systems industries have experienced significant downturns often connected with or in anticipation of maturing product cycles of both these industries’ and their customers’ products and a decline in general economic conditions these downturns have been characterized by diminished product demand production overcapacity high inventory levels and accelerated erosion of average selling prices any economic downturn in the industries we serve could harm our business operating results or financial condition 

 

our failure to respond quickly to technological developments could make our products uncompetitive and obsolete 

 

the industries in which we compete experience rapid technology developments changes in industry standards changes in customer requirements and frequent new product introductions and improvements currently the industries we serve are experiencing several revolutionary trends 

 

 10 

   

if we are unable to respond quickly and successfully to these developments we may lose our competitive position and our products or technologies may become uncompetitive or obsolete to compete successfully we must develop or acquire new products and improve our existing products and processes on a schedule that keeps pace with technological developments and the requirements for products addressing a broad spectrum of designers and designer expertise in our industries we must also be able to support a range of changing computer software hardware platforms and customer preferences we cannot guarantee that we will be successful in this effort 

 

we have experienced varied operating results and our operating results for any particular fiscal period are affected by the timing of significant orders for our software products fluctuations in customer preferences for license types and the timing of revenue recognition under those license types 

 

we have experienced and may continue to experience varied operating results in particular we have experienced net losses for some past periods and we may experience net losses in future periods various factors affect our operating results and some of them are not within our control our operating results for any period are affected by the timing of significant orders for our software products because a significant number of licenses for our software products are in excess of 50 million 

 

our operating results are also affected by the mix of license types executed in any given period we license software using three different license types subscription term and perpetual product revenue associated with term and perpetual licenses is generally recognized at the beginning of the license period whereas product revenue associated with subscription licenses is recognized over multiple periods during the term of the license revenue may also be deferred under term and perpetual licenses until payments become due and payable from customers with nonlinear payment terms or as cash is collected from customers with lower credit ratings in addition revenue is impacted by the timing of license renewals the extent to which contracts contain flexible payment terms changes in existing contractual arrangements with customers and the mix of license types ie perpetual term or subscription for existing customers which changes could have the effect of accelerating or delaying the recognition of revenue from the timing of recognition under the original contract 

 

we plan operating expense levels primarily based on forecasted revenue levels these expenses and the impact of longterm commitments are relatively fixed in the short term a shortfall in revenue could lead to operating results below expectations because we may not be able to quickly reduce these fixed expenses in response to these shortterm business changes 

 

the majority of our contracts are executed in the final two weeks of a fiscal quarter this makes it difficult to determine with accuracy how much business will be executed in each fiscal quarter due to the volume or 

complexity of transactions that we review at the very end of the quarter or due to operational matters regarding particular agreements we may not finish processing or ship products under some contracts that have been signed during that fiscal quarter which means that the associated revenue cannot be recognized in that particular period 

 

you should not view our historical results of operations as reliable indicators of our future performance if revenue operating results or our business outlook for future periods fall short of the levels expected by public market analysts or investors the trading price of our common stock could decline 

 

our future revenue is dependent in part upon our installed customer base continuing to license or buy additional products renew maintenance agreements and purchase additional services 

 

our installed customer base has traditionally generated additional new license service and maintenance revenues in future periods customers may not necessarily license or buy additional products or contract for additional services or maintenance maintenance is generally renewable annually at a customer’s option and there are no mandatory payment obligations or obligations to license additional software if our customers decide not to renew their maintenance agreements or license additional products or contract for additional services or if they reduce the scope of the maintenance agreements our revenue could decrease which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

 

we may not receive significant revenue from our current research and development efforts for several years if at all 

 

internally developing software products integrating acquired software products and integrating intellectual property into existing platforms is expensive and these investments often require a long time to generate returns our strategy involves significant investments in software research and development and related product opportunities we believe that we must continue to dedicate a significant amount of resources to our research and development efforts to maintain our competitive position however we cannot predict that we will receive significant if any revenue from these investments 

 

our failure to attract train motivate and retain key employees may make us less competitive in our industries and therefore harm our results of operations 

 

our business depends on the efforts and abilities of our employees the high cost of training new employees not fully utilizing these employees or losing trained employees to competing employers could reduce our gross margins and harm our business or operating results competition for highly skilled employees can be intense particularly in geographic areas recognized as high technology centers such as the silicon valley area where our principal offices are located and the other locations where we maintain facilities to attract retain and motivate individuals with the requisite expertise we may be required to grant large numbers of stock options or other stockbased incentive awards which may be dilutive to existing stockholders and increase compensation expense we may also be required to pay key employees significant base salaries and cash bonuses which could harm our operating results 

 

in addition the nasdaq marketplace rules require stockholder approval for new equity compensation plans and significant amendments to existing plans including increases in shares available for issuance under such plans and prohibit nasdaq member organizations from giving a proxy to vote on equity compensation plans unless the beneficial owner of the shares has given voting instructions these regulations could make it more difficult for us to grant equity compensation to employees in the future to the extent that these regulations make it more difficult or expensive to grant equity compensation to employees we may incur increased compensation costs or find it difficult to attract retain and motivate employees which could materially and adversely affect our business 

 

we have acquired and expect to acquire other companies and businesses and may not realize the expected benefits of these acquisitions 

 

we have acquired and expect to acquire other companies and businesses in the future while we expect to carefully analyze each potential acquisition before committing to the transaction we may not be able to integrate and manage acquired products and businesses effectively in addition acquisitions involve a number of risks if any 

of the following events occurs after we acquire another business it could seriously harm our business operating results or financial condition 

 

  

in a number of our previously completed acquisitions we have agreed to make future payments either in the form of employee bonuses or contingent purchase price payments or earnouts based on the performance of the acquired businesses or the employees who joined us with the acquired businesses the performance goals pursuant to which these future payments may be made generally relate to achievement by the acquired business or the employees who joined us with the acquired business of certain specified bookings revenue product proliferation product development or employee retention goals during a specified period following completion of the applicable acquisition future acquisitions may involve issuances of stock as full or partial payment of the purchase price for the acquired business grants of incentive stock or options to employees of the acquired businesses which may be dilutive to existing stockholders expenditure of substantial cash resources or the incurrence of material amounts of debt 

 

the specific performance goal levels and amounts and timing of employee bonuses or contingent purchase price payments vary with each acquisition in connection with our acquisitions completed prior to december 29 2007 we may be obligated to pay up to an aggregate of 450 million in cash during the next 53 months if certain performance goals related to one or more of the criteria mentioned above are achieved in full 

 

the competition in our industries is substantial and we may not be able to continue to successfully compete in our industries 

 

the eda market and the commercial electronics design and methodology services industries are highly competitive if we fail to compete successfully in these industries it could seriously harm our business operating results or financial condition to compete in these industries we must identify and develop or acquire innovative and costcompetitive eda products integrate them into platforms and market them in a timely manner we must also gain industry acceptance for our design and methodology services and offer better strategic concepts technical solutions prices and response time or a combination of these factors than those of other design companies and the internal design departments of electronics manufacturers we cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully in these industries factors that could affect our ability to succeed include 

 

 13 

  

we compete in the eda products market with synopsys inc mentor graphics corporation and magma design automation inc we also compete with numerous smaller eda companies with manufacturers of electronic devices that have developed or have the capability to develop their own eda products and with numerous electronics design and consulting companies manufacturers of electronic devices may be reluctant to purchase design and methodology services from independent vendors such as us because they wish to promote their own internal design departments 

 

we may need to change our pricing models to compete successfully 

 

the highly competitive markets in which we compete can put pressure on us to reduce the prices of our products if our competitors offer deep discounts on certain products in an effort to recapture or gain market segment share or to sell other software or hardware products we may then need to lower our prices or offer other favorable terms to compete successfully any such changes would be likely to reduce our profit margins and could adversely affect our operating results any substantial changes to our prices and pricing policies could cause sales and software license revenues to decline or be delayed as our sales force implements and our customers adjust to the new pricing policies some of our competitors may bundle products for promotional purposes or as a longterm pricing strategy or provide guarantees of prices and product implementations these practices could over time significantly constrain the prices that we can charge for our products if we cannot offset price reductions with a corresponding increase in the number of sales or with lower spending then the reduced license revenues resulting from lower prices could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

 

we rely on our proprietary technology as well as software and other intellectual property rights licensed to us by third parties and we cannot assure you that the precautions taken to protect our rights will be adequate or that we will continue to be able to adequately secure such intellectual property rights from third parties 

 

our success depends in part upon our proprietary technology we generally rely on patents copyrights trademarks trade secret laws licenses and restrictive agreements to establish and protect our proprietary rights in technology and products despite precautions we may take to protect our intellectual property third parties have tried in the past and may try in the future to challenge invalidate or circumvent these safeguards the rights granted under our patents or attendant to our other intellectual property may not provide us with any competitive advantages and there is no guarantee that patents will be issued on any of our pending applications and future patents may not be sufficiently broad to protect our technology furthermore the laws of foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights in those countries to the same extent as applicable law protects these rights in the united states many of our products include software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties we may have to seek new or renew existing licenses for such software and other intellectual property in the future our design and methodology services business holds licenses to certain software and other intellectual property owned by third parties including that of our competitors our failure to obtain for our use software or other intellectual property licenses or other intellectual property rights on favorable terms or the need to engage in litigation over these licenses or rights could seriously harm our business operating results or financial condition 

 

we could lose key technology or suffer serious harm to our business because of the infringement of our intellectual property rights by third parties or because of our infringement of the intellectual property rights of third parties 

 

there are numerous patents in the eda industry and new patents are being issued at a rapid rate it is not always practicable to determine in advance whether a product or any of its components infringes the patent rights of others as a result from time to time we may be compelled to respond to or prosecute intellectual property infringement claims to protect our rights or defend a customer’s rights 

 

intellectual property infringement claims regardless of merit could consume valuable management time result in costly litigation or cause product shipment delays all of which could seriously harm our business operating results or financial condition in settling these claims we may be required to enter into royalty or licensing agreements with the third parties claiming infringement these royalty or licensing agreements if 

available may not have terms favorable to us being compelled to enter into a license agreement with unfavorable terms could seriously harm our business operating results or financial condition any potential intellectual property litigation could compel us to do one or more of the following 

 

  

if we were compelled to take any of these actions our business or results of operations may suffer 

 

if our security measures are breached and an unauthorized party obtains access to customer data our information systems may be perceived as being unsecure and customers may curtail or stop their use of our products and services 

 

our products and services involve the storage and transmission of customers’ proprietary information and breaches of our security measures could expose us to a risk of loss or misuse of this information litigation and potential liability because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage information systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventive measures if an actual or perceived breach of our security occurs the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed and we could lose existing customers and our ability to obtain new customers 

 

we may not be able to effectively implement our restructuring activities and our restructuring activities may not result in the expected benefits which would negatively impact our future results of operations 

 

the eda market and the commercial electronics design and methodology services industries are highly competitive and change quickly we have responded to increased competition and changes in the industries in which we compete in part by restructuring our operations and at times reducing the size of our workforce despite our restructuring efforts in prior years we may not achieve all of the operating expense reductions and improvements in operating margins and cash flows anticipated from those restructuring activities in the periods contemplated our inability to realize these benefits may result in an inefficient business structure that could negatively impact our results of operations 

 

we have reduced the workforce in certain revenuegenerating portions of our business these reductions in staffing levels could require us to forego certain future opportunities due to resource limitations which could negatively affect our longterm revenues we may need to implement further restructuring activities or reductions in our workforce based on changes in the markets and industries in which we compete or that any future restructuring efforts will be successful 

 

the long sales cycle of our products and services makes the timing of our revenue difficult to predict and may cause our operating results to fluctuate unexpectedly 

 

generally we have a long sales cycle that can extend up to six months or longer the length of the sales cycle may cause our revenue or operating results to vary from quarter to quarter the complexity and expense associated with our business generally require a lengthy customer education evaluation and approval process consequently we may incur substantial expenses and devote significant management effort and expense to develop potential relationships that do not result in agreements or revenue and may prevent us from pursuing other opportunities 

 

in addition sales of our products and services may be delayed if customers delay approval or commencement of projects because of 

 

 15 

 

long sales cycles for acceleration and emulation hardware products subject us to a number of significant risks over which we have limited control including insufficient excess or obsolete inventory variations in inventory valuation and fluctuations in quarterly operating results 

 

the majority of our contracts are executed in the final two weeks of a fiscal quarter this makes it difficult to determine with accuracy how much business will be executed in each fiscal quarter also because of the timing of large orders and our customers’ buying patterns we may not learn of bookings shortfalls revenue shortfalls earnings shortfalls or other failures to meet market expectations until late in a fiscal quarter these factors may cause our operating results to fluctuate unexpectedly which can cause significant fluctuations in the trading price of our common stock 

 

we may not be able to sell certain installment contracts to generate cash which may impact our operating cash flows for any particular fiscal period 

 

we sell certain installment contracts to certain financing institutions on a nonrecourse or limitedrecourse basis to generate cash our ability to complete these sales of installment contracts is affected by a number of factors including the 

 

  

if we are unable to sell certain installment contracts our operating cash flows would be adversely affected there can be no assurance that funding will be available to us or if available that it will be on terms acceptable to us if sources of funding are not available to us on a regular basis for any reason including the occurrence of events of default deterioration in credit quality in the underlying pool of receivables or otherwise it would have a material adverse effect on our operating cash flows 

 

the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations and other risks to our international operations may seriously harm our financial condition 

 

we have significant operations outside the united states our revenue from international operations as a percentage of total revenue was approximately 54 in 2007 48 in 2006 and 54 in 2005 we expect that revenue from our international operations will continue to account for a significant portion of our total revenue we also transact business in various foreign currencies recent economic and political uncertainty and the volatility of foreign currencies in certain regions most notably the japanese yen european union euro british pound and indian rupee have had and may in the future have a harmful effect on our revenue or operating results 

 

fluctuations in the rate of exchange between the united states dollar and the currencies of other countries in which we conduct business could seriously harm our business operating results or financial condition for example when a foreign currency declines in value relative to the united states dollar it takes more of the foreign currency to purchase the same amount of united states dollars than before the change if we price our products and services in the foreign currency we receive fewer united states dollars than we did before the change if we price our products and services in united states dollars the decrease in value of the local currency results in an increase in the price for our products and services compared to those products of our competitors that are priced in local currency this could result in our prices being uncompetitive in markets where business is transacted in the local currency on the other hand when a foreign currency increases in value relative to the united states dollar it takes more united states dollars to purchase the same amount of the foreign currency as we use the foreign currency to pay for payroll costs and other operating expenses in our international operations this results in an increase in operating expenses 

 

exposure to foreign currency transaction risk can arise when transactions are conducted in a currency different from the functional currency of one of our subsidiaries a subsidiary’s functional currency is generally the currency in which it primarily conducts its operations including product pricing expenses and borrowings although we attempt to reduce the impact of foreign currency fluctuations significant exchange rate movements may hurt our results of operations as expressed in united states dollars 

 

our international operations may also be subject to other risks including 

 

 16 

  

we have offices throughout the world including key research and development facilities outside of the united states our operations are dependent upon the connectivity of our operations throughout the world activities that interfere with our international connectivity such as computer hacking or the introduction of a virus into our computer systems could significantly interfere with our business operations 

 

our operating results could be adversely affected as a result of changes in our effective tax rates 

 

our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by the following 

 

  

any significant change in our future effective tax rates could adversely impact our results of operations for future periods 

 

we have received examination reports from the internal revenue service proposing deficiencies in certain of our tax returns and the outcome of current and future tax examinations may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows 

 

the irs and other tax authorities regularly examine our income tax returns in july 2006 the irs completed its field examination of our federal income tax returns for the tax years 2000 through 2002 and issued an rar in which the irs proposed to assess an aggregate tax deficiency for the threeyear period of approximately 3240 million in november 2006 the irs revised the proposed aggregate tax deficiency for the threeyear period to be approximately 3180 million the irs is contesting our qualification for deferred recognition of certain proceeds received from restitution and settlement in connection with litigation during the period the proposed tax deficiency for this item is approximately 1520 million the remaining proposed tax deficiency of approximately 1660 million is primarily related to proposed adjustments to our transfer pricing arrangements that we had with foreign subsidiaries and to our deductions for foreign trade income the irs may make similar claims against our transfer pricing arrangements and deductions for foreign trade income in future examinations we have filed a timely protest with the irs and will seek resolution of the issues through the appeals office of the irs or the appeals office 

 

we believe that the proposed irs adjustments are inconsistent with applicable tax laws and we are vigorously challenging these proposed adjustments the rar is not a final statutory notice of deficiency but the irs imposes interest on the proposed deficiencies until the matters are resolved interest is compounded daily at rates published 

by the irs which rates are adjusted quarterly and have been between 4 and 10 since 2001 the irs is currently examining our federal income tax returns for the tax years 2003 through 2005 

 

we adopted the provisions of the financial accounting standards board or fasb interpretation or fin no 48 “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes – an interpretation of fasb statement no 109” on december 31 2006 which was the first day of our 2007 fiscal year fin no 48 prescribes a new recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of an income tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return under fin no 48 only income tax positions that meet the “more likely than not” recognition threshold may be recognized in the financial statements an income tax position that meets the “more likely than not” recognition threshold shall initially and subsequently be measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50 likely of being realized upon effective settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information 

 

significant judgment is required in applying the principles of fin no 48 and statement of financial accounting standard or sfas no 109 the calculation of our provision for income taxes involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes we regularly assess the potential settlement outcomes resulting from income tax examinations however the final outcome of tax examinations including the total amount payable or the timing of any such payments upon resolution of these issues cannot be estimated with certainty in addition we cannot be certain that such amount will not be materially different than that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals should the irs or other tax authorities assess additional taxes as a result of a current or a future examination we may be required to record charges to operations in future periods that could have a material impact on the results of operations financial position or cash flows in the applicable period or periods 

 

forecasting our estimated annual effective tax rate is complex and subject to uncertainty and material differences between forecasted and actual tax rates could have a material impact on our results of operations 

 

forecasts of our income tax position and resultant effective tax rate are complex and subject to uncertainty because our income tax position for each year combines the effects of a mix of profits and losses earned by us and our subsidiaries in tax jurisdictions with a broad range of income tax rates as well as benefits from available deferred tax assets the impact of various accounting rules and changes to these rules and results of tax audits to forecast our global tax rate pretax profits and losses by jurisdiction are estimated and tax expense by jurisdiction is calculated if the mix of profits and losses our ability to use tax credits or effective tax rates by jurisdiction is different than those estimates our actual tax rate could be materially different than forecasted which could have a material impact on our results of operations 

 

failure to obtain export licenses could harm our business by rendering us unable to ship products and transfer our technology outside of the united states 

 

we must comply with regulations of the united states and of certain other countries in shipping our software products and transferring our technology outside the united states and to foreign nationals although we have not had any significant difficulty complying with such regulations so far any significant future difficulty in complying could harm our business operating results or financial condition 

 

errors or defects in our products and services could expose us to liability and harm our reputation 

 

our customers use our products and services in designing and developing products that involve a high degree of technological complexity each of which has its own specifications because of the complexity of the systems and products with which we work some of our products and designs can be adequately tested only when put to full use in the marketplace as a result our customers or their end users may discover errors or defects in our software or the systems we design or the products or systems incorporating our design and intellectual property may not operate as expected errors or defects could result in 

 

 18 

  

if we become subject to unfair hiring claims we could be prevented from hiring needed employees incur liability for damages and incur substantial costs in defending ourselves 

 

companies in our industry whose employees accept positions with competitors frequently claim that these competitors have engaged in unfair hiring practices or that the employment of these persons would involve the disclosure or use of trade secrets these claims could prevent us from hiring employees or cause us to incur liability for damages we could also incur substantial costs in defending ourselves or our employees against these claims regardless of their merits defending ourselves from these claims could also divert the attention of our management away from our operations 

 

our business is subject to the risk of earthquakes 

 

our corporate headquarters including certain of our research and development operations and certain of our distribution facilities is located in the silicon valley area of northern california which is a region known to experience seismic activity if significant seismic activity were to occur our operations may be interrupted which would adversely impact our business and results of operations 

 

we maintain research and development and other facilities in parts of the world that are not as politically stable as the united states and as a result we may face a higher risk of business interruption from acts of war or terrorism than businesses located only or primarily in the united states 

 

we maintain international research and development and other facilities some of which are in parts of the world that are not as politically stable as the united states consequently we may face a greater risk of business interruption as a result of terrorist acts or military conflicts than businesses located domestically furthermore this potential harm is exacerbated given that damage to or disruptions at our international research and development facilities could have an adverse effect on our ability to develop new or improve existing products as compared to other businesses which may only have sales offices or other less critical operations abroad we are not insured for losses or interruptions caused by acts of war or terrorism 

 

risks related to our securities and indebtedness 

 

our debt obligations expose us to risks that could adversely affect our business operating results or financial condition and could prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under such indebtedness 

 

we have a substantial level of debt as of december 29 2007 we had 7304 million of outstanding indebtedness as follows 

 

  

the level of our indebtedness among other things could 

 

 19 

 

if we experience a decline in revenue due to any of the factors described in this section entitled “risk factors” or otherwise we could have difficulty paying amounts due on our indebtedness in the case of the 2023 notes although they mature in 2023 the holders of the 2023 notes may require us to repurchase for cash all or any portion of the 2023 notes on august 15 2008 for 10025 of the principal amount august 15 2013 for 10000 of the principal amount and august 15 2018 for 10000 of the principal amount as a result although the 2023 notes mature in 2023 the holders may require us to repurchase the 2023 notes at an additional premium in 2008 which makes it probable that we will be required to repurchase the 2023 notes in 2008 if they have not first been repurchased by us or are not otherwise converted 

 

if we are prohibited from paying our outstanding indebtedness we could try to obtain the consent of the lenders under those arrangements to make such payment or we could attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain the restrictions if we do not obtain the necessary consents or refinance the borrowings we may be unable to satisfy our outstanding indebtedness any such failure would constitute an event of default under our indebtedness which could in turn constitute a default under the terms of any other indebtedness then outstanding 

 

if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow or otherwise obtain funds necessary to make required payments or if we fail to comply with the various requirements of our indebtedness we would be in default which would permit the holders of our indebtedness to accelerate the maturity of the indebtedness and could cause defaults under our other indebtedness as well any default under our indebtedness could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition in addition a material default on our indebtedness could suspend our eligibility to register securities using certain registration statement forms under sec guidelines that permit incorporation by reference of substantial information regarding us which could potentially hinder our ability to raise capital through the issuance of our securities and will increase the costs of such registration to us 

 

in august 2007 the fasb issued proposed fasb staff position or fsp apb14a “accounting for convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion including partial cash settlement” which if issued in its present form would require us to recognize additional noncash interest expense related to our convertible senior notes in our consolidated income statements if adopted in its present form fsp apb 14a will have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition particularly with respect to interest expense ratios commonly referred to by lenders and could potentially hinder our ability to raise capital through the issuance of debt or equity securities 

 

conversion of the 2023 notes or the convertible senior notes will dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders 

 

the terms of the 2023 notes and the convertible senior notes permit the holders to convert the 2023 notes and the convertible senior notes into shares of our common stock the 2023 notes are convertible into our common stock initially at a conversion price of 1565 per share which would result in an aggregate of approximately 147 million shares of our common stock being issued upon conversion subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events the terms of the convertible senior notes stipulate a net share settlement which upon conversion of the convertible senior notes requires us to pay the principal amount in cash and the conversion premium if any in shares of our common stock based on a daily settlement amount calculated on a proportionate basis for each day of the relevant 20 tradingday observation period the initial conversion rate for the convertible senior notes is 472813 shares of our common stock per 1000 principal amount of convertible senior notes equivalent to a conversion price of approximately 2115 per share of our common stock the conversion price is subject to adjustment in some events but will not be adjusted for accrued interest except in limited circumstances the conversion of some or all of the 2023 notes or the convertible senior notes will dilute the ownership interest of our existing stockholders any sales in the public market of the common stock issuable upon conversion could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock 

 

prior to conversion of the 2023 notes if the trading price of our common stock exceeds 2269 per share over specified periods basic net income per share will be diluted we may redeem for cash all or any part of the 2023 notes on or after august 15 2008 for 10000 of the principal amount the holders of the 2023 notes may require us to repurchase for cash all or any portion of their 2023 notes on august 15 2008 for 10025 of the principal amount on august 15 2013 for 10000 of the principal amount or on august 15 2018 for 10000 of the principal amount by providing to the paying agent a written repurchase notice the repurchase notice must be delivered during the period commencing 30 business days prior to the relevant repurchase date and ending on the 

close of business on the business day prior to the relevant repurchase date we may redeem for cash all or any part of the 2023 notes on or after august 15 2008 for 10000 of the principal amount except for those 2023 notes that holders have required us to repurchase on august 15 2008 or on other repurchase dates as described above 

 

each 1000 of principal of the 2023 notes is initially convertible into 63879 shares of our common stock subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events holders of the 2023 notes may convert their 2023 notes prior to maturity only if 

 

  

as a result although the 2023 notes mature in 2023 the holders may require us to repurchase their notes at an additional premium in 2008 which makes it probable that we will be required to repurchase the 2023 notes in 2008 if they have not first been repurchased by us or are not otherwise converted as of december 29 2007 none of the conditions allowing holders of the 2023 notes to convert had been met 

 

each 1000 of principal of the convertible senior notes is initially convertible into 472813 shares of our common stock subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events holders of the convertible senior notes may convert their notes at their option on any day prior to the close of business on the scheduled trading day immediately preceding december 15 2011 in the case of the 2011 notes and december 15 2013 in the case of the 2013 notes in each case only if 

 

  

on and after november 2 2011 in the case of the 2011 notes and november 1 2013 in the case of 2013 notes until the close of business on the scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date of such convertible senior notes holders may convert their convertible senior notes at any time regardless of the foregoing circumstances as of december 29 2007 none of the conditions allowing holders of the convertible senior notes to convert had been met 

 

although the conversion price of the 2023 notes is currently 1565 per share the hedge and warrant transactions that we entered into in connection with the issuance of the 2023 notes effectively increased the conversion price of the 2023 notes until various dates in 2008 to approximately 2308 per share which would result in an aggregate issuance upon conversion prior to august 15 2008 of approximately 102 million shares of our common stock we entered into hedge and warrant transactions to reduce the potential dilution from the conversion of the 2023 notes however we cannot guarantee that such hedge and warrant instruments will fully mitigate the dilution in addition the existence of the 2023 notes may encourage short selling by market participants because the conversion of the 2023 notes could depress the price of our common stock 

 

although the conversion price of the convertible senior notes is currently 2115 per share we entered into hedge and separate warrant transactions to reduce the potential dilution from the conversion of the convertible senior notes however we cannot guarantee that such hedges and warrant instruments will fully mitigate the dilution in addition the existence of the convertible senior notes may encourage short selling by market participants because the conversion of the convertible senior notes could depress the price of our common stock 

 

at the option of the 2023 noteholders and the convertible senior noteholders under certain circumstances we may be required to repurchase the 2023 notes and the convertible senior notes as the case may be in cash or shares of our common stock 

 

under the terms of the 2023 notes and the convertible senior notes we may be required to repurchase the 2023 notes and the convertible senior notes following a “fundamental change” in our corporate ownership or structure such as a change of control in which substantially all of the consideration does not consist of publicly traded securities prior to maturity of the 2023 notes and the convertible senior notes as the case may be 

following a fundamental change in certain circumstances we may choose to pay the repurchase price of the 2023 notes in cash shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock if we choose to pay all or any part of the repurchase price of the 2023 notes in shares of our common stock this would result in dilution to the holders of our common stock the repurchase price for the convertible senior notes in the event of a fundamental change must be paid solely in cash these repayment obligations may have the effect of discouraging delaying or preventing a takeover of our company that may otherwise be beneficial to investors 

 

hedge and warrant transactions entered into in connection with the issuance of the convertible senior notes and the 2023 notes may affect the value of our common stock 

 

we entered into hedge transactions with various financial institutions at the time of issuance of the convertible senior notes and the 2023 notes with the objective of reducing the potential dilutive effect of issuing our common stock upon conversion of the convertible senior notes and the 2023 notes we also entered into separate warrant transactions with the same financial institutions in connection with our hedge and warrant transactions these financial institutions purchased our common stock in secondary market transactions and entered into various overthecounter derivative transactions with respect to our common stock these entities or their affiliates are likely to modify their hedge positions from time to time prior to conversion or maturity of the convertible senior notes and the 2023 notes by purchasing and selling shares of our common stock other of our securities or other instruments they may wish to use in connection with such hedging any of these transactions and activities could adversely affect the value of our common stock and as a result the number of shares and the value of the common stock holders will receive upon conversion of the convertible senior notes and the 2023 notes in addition subject to movement in the price of our common stock if the hedge transactions settle in our favor we could be exposed to credit risk related to the other party with respect to the payment we are owed from such other party 

 

rating agencies may provide unsolicited ratings on the convertible senior notes that could reduce the market value or liquidity of our common stock 

 

we have not requested a rating of the convertible senior notes from any rating agency and we do not anticipate that the convertible senior notes will be rated however if one or more rating agencies independently elects to rate the convertible senior notes and assigns the convertible senior notes a rating lower than the rating expected by investors or reduces such rating in the future the market price or liquidity of the convertible senior notes and our common stock could be harmed should a decline in the market price of the convertible senior notes result as compared to the price of our common stock this may trigger the right of the holders of the convertible senior notes to convert the convertible senior notes into cash and shares of our common stock 

 

antitakeover defenses in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and certain provisions under delaware law could prevent an acquisition of our company or limit the price that investors might be willing to pay for our common stock 

 

our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and certain provisions of the delaware general corporation law that apply to us could make it difficult for another company to acquire control of our company for example 

 

  

all or any one of these factors could limit the price that certain investors would be willing to pay for shares of our common stock and could delay prevent or allow our board of directors to resist an acquisition of our company even if a proposed transaction were favored by a majority of our independent stockholders

in january 2007 we completed the sale of certain of our land and buildings in san jose california concurrently with the sale we leased back from the purchaser all available space in the buildings the lease agreement includes an initial term of two years with two options to extend the lease for six months each we will use the approximately 262500 square feet of leased space until the facility construction described above is completed 

 

we lease additional facilities in the united states and various other countries we sublease certain of these facilities where space is not fully utilized or has been involved in restructuring activities 

 

we believe that these facilities and the facility under construction at our headquarters campus are adequate for our current needs and that suitable additional or substitute space will be available as needed to accommodate any expansion of our operations 

 




 item 3 legal proceedings 

 

from time to time we are involved in various disputes and litigation matters that arise in the ordinary course of business these include disputes and lawsuits related to intellectual property mergers and acquisitions licensing contracts distribution arrangements and employee relations matters at least quarterly we review the status of each significant matter and assess its potential financial exposure if the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount or the range of loss can be estimated we accrue a liability for the estimated loss in accordance with sfas no 5 “accounting for contingencies” legal proceedings are subject to uncertainties and the outcomes are difficult to predict because of such uncertainties accruals are based only on the best information available at the time as additional information becomes available we reassess the potential liability related to pending claims and litigation matters and may revise estimates 

 

on february 8 2007 we magma design automation inc or magma altera corp or altera and mentor graphics corp or mentor filed a complaint in the united states district court for the northern district of california against an individual narpat bhandari or bhandari and vanguard systems inc or vanguard the complaint sought a declaratory judgment that us patent no 5663900 or the ’900 patent which discloses an electronic simulation and emulation system and is allegedly owned by bhandari and vanguard is not infringed and is invalid and unenforceable the complaint further sought a declaratory judgment that lsi logic corporation or lsi has an ownership interest in the ’900 patent that precludes bhandari and vanguard from asserting the patent without first joining lsi in march 2007 cadence magma altera and mentor amended the complaint to further plead noninfringement on the basis of obtaining a license to the ’900 patent from its coowner lsi in april 2007 bhandari and vanguard answered the amended complaint asserting counterclaims alleging that certain products of ours and the other plaintiffs infringed the ’900 patent in a case management conference held on may 21 2007 the court granted the request of us magma altera and mentor to bifurcate the case and stay all issues except for the question of lsi’s ownership interest in the ’900 patent we magma altera and mentor filed a motion for summary judgment that lsi was a jointowner and that the license from lsi warranted dismissal of bhandari and vanguard’s claim which the court granted in favor of us magma altera and mentor on december 4 2007 the court issued an order entering judgment in favor of us magma altera and mentor and against bhandari and vanguard thus bringing this matter to a close 

 

on may 30 2007 ahmed higazi a former cadence employee filed suit against us in the united states district court for the northern district of california alleging that we improperly classified him and a class of other cadence information technology employees as exempt from overtime pay the suit alleges claims for unpaid overtime under the federal fair labor standards act and california law waitingtime penalties under the california labor code failure to provide proper earnings statements under california law failure to provide meal periods and rest breaks as required by california law unfair business practices under california business  professions code section 17200 and 

unpaid 401k contributions in violation of the employee retirement income security act or erisa on june 20 2007 we answered plaintiff’s complaint denying its material allegations and raising a number of affirmative defenses and on december 19 2007 we filed an amended answer a period of discovery conducted by both sides then ensued followed in january 2008 by a private mediation of the case at the mediation the parties were successful in resolving their respective differences and have entered into a settlement agreement without contesting the merits of the claims or admitting liability  the parties are in the process of preparing the various papers for court approval of the settlement final approval is not expected to occur until the third quarter of 2008 

 

while the outcome of these disputes and litigation matters cannot be predicted with any certainty management does not believe that the outcome of any current matters will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position liquidity or results of operations

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend  

the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k certain of such statements including but not limited to statements regarding the extent and timing of future revenues and expenses and customer demand statements regarding the deployment of our products statements regarding our reliance on third parties and other statements using words such as “anticipates” “believes” “could” “estimates” “expects” “intends” “may” “plans” “should” “will” and “would” and words of similar import and the negatives thereof constitute forwardlooking statements these statements are predictions based upon our current expectations about future events actual results could vary materially as a result of certain factors including but not limited to those expressed in these statements we refer you to the “competition” “proprietary technology” “risk factors” “results of operations” “disclosures about market risk” and “liquidity and capital resources” sections contained in this annual report and the risks discussed in our other sec filings which identify important risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forwardlooking statements 

 

we urge you to consider these factors carefully in evaluating the forwardlooking statements contained in this annual report all subsequent written or spoken forwardlooking statements attributable to our company or persons acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by these cautionary statements the forwardlooking statements included in this annual report are made only as of the date of this annual report we do not intend and undertake no obligation to update these forwardlooking statements 

overview 

 

we develop electronic design automation or eda software and hardware we license software sell or lease hardware technology provide maintenance for our software and hardware and provide design methodology and education services throughout the world to help manage and accelerate electronics product development processes our broad range of products and services are used by the world’s leading electronics companies to design and develop complex integrated circuits or ics and electronics systems 

 

with the addition of emerging nanometer design considerations to the already burgeoning set of traditional design tasks complex soc or ic design can no longer be accomplished using a collection of discrete design tools what previously consisted of sequential design activities must be merged and accomplished nearly simultaneously without timeconsuming data translation steps we combine our design technologies into “platforms” addressing four major design activities functional verification digital ic design custom ic design and system interconnect design the four cadence design platforms are incisive functional verification encounter digital ic design virtuoso custom design and allegro system interconnect design platforms in addition we augment these platform product offerings with a comprehensive set of dfm products that service both the digital and custom ic design flows these four platforms together with our dfm products comprise our primary product lines 

 

digital implementation was the fastest growing product group in 2007 in terms of revenue driven by the focus on complex chips advanced nodes and low power design challenges at the 65 nanometer and 45 nanometer process nodes drove upgrades in the digital custom and dfm product groups also during 2007 the allegro system interconnect design platform had a complete technology update and the custom simulation business had a significant product update 

 

we have identified certain items that management uses as performance indicators to manage our business including revenue certain elements of operating expenses and cash flow from operations and we describe these items more fully below under the heading “results of operations” below 

 

critical accounting estimates 

 

in preparing our consolidated financial statements we make assumptions judgments and estimates that can have a significant impact on our revenue operating income and net income as well as on the value of certain assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets we base our assumptions judgments and estimates on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions at least quarterly we evaluate our assumptions judgments and estimates and make changes accordingly we believe that the assumptions judgments and estimates involved in the accounting for revenue recognition accounting for income taxes and valuation of stockbased awards have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements therefore we consider these to be our critical accounting estimates historically our assumptions judgments and estimates relative to our critical accounting estimates have not differed materially from actual results for further information on our significant accounting policies see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements 

 

revenue recognition 

 

we apply the provisions of statement of position or sop 972 “software revenue recognition” as amended by sop 989 “modification of sop 972 software revenue recognition with respect to certain transactions” to all software licensing transactions and to all product revenue transactions where the software is not incidental we also apply the provisions of sfas no 13 “accounting for leases” to all hardware lease transactions we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists the product has been delivered the fee is fixed or determinable collection of the resulting receivable is probable and vendorspecific objective evidence of fair value or vsoe exists 

 

we license software using three different license types 

 

  

for many of our term and subscription license arrangements we use our proprietary internetbased delivery mechanism “edaontap” to facilitate the delivery of our software products to maximize the efficiency of this 

delivery mechanism we created what we refer to as “eda cards” of which there are two types subscription license customers may purchase what we refer to as an “eda platinum card” which provides the customer access to and use of all software products delivered at the outset of the arrangement and the ability to use additional unspecified software products that may become commercially available during the term of the arrangement term license customers may purchase what we refer to as an “eda gold card” which provides the customer access to and use of all software products delivered at the outset of the arrangement overall the eda cards provide greater flexibility for our customers in how and when they deploy and use our software products 

 

subscription licenses  – our subscription license arrangements offer our customers the right to 

 

  

customers that purchase an eda platinum card have the ability during the term of the arrangement to use software products delivered at the outset of the arrangement and to use other unspecified additional software products that may become commercially available during the term of the arrangement until the fees have been depleted 

 

in general revenue associated with subscription licenses is recognized ratably over the term of the license commencing upon the later of the effective date of the arrangement or delivery of the software product subscription license revenue is allocated to product and maintenance revenue the allocation to maintenance revenue is based on vendor specific objective evidence or vsoe of fair value of the undelivered maintenance that was established in connection with the sale of our term licenses 

 

in the event that a subscription license arrangement is terminated by mutual agreement and a new term license arrangement is entered into either concurrently with or subsequent to the termination of the subscription license arrangement the revenue associated with the new term license arrangement is recognized upon the later of the effective date of the arrangement or delivery of the software product assuming all other criteria in sop 972 have been met 

 

term licenses  – our term license arrangements offer our customers the right to 

 

  

customers that purchase an eda gold card have the ability during the term of the arrangement to use software products delivered at the outset of the arrangement until the fees relating to the arrangement have been depleted 

 

in general revenue associated with term licenses is recognized upon the later of the effective date of the arrangement or delivery of the software product 

 

perpetual licenses  – our perpetual licenses consist of software licensed on a perpetual basis with no right to return or exchange the licensed software in general revenue associated with perpetual licenses is recognized upon the later of the effective date of the license or delivery of the licensed product 

persuasive evidence of an arrangement  – generally we use a contract signed by the customer as evidence of an arrangement for subscription and term licenses and hardware leases if a contract signed by the customer does not exist we have historically used a purchase order as evidence of an arrangement for perpetual licenses hardware sales maintenance renewals and small fixedprice service projects such as training classes and small methodology service engagements of approximately 10000 or less for all other service engagements we use a signed professional services agreement and a statement of work to evidence an arrangement in cases where both a signed contract and a purchase order exist we consider the signed contract to be the most persuasive evidence of the arrangement sales through our distributors are evidenced by a master agreement governing the relationship together with binding purchase orders from the distributor on a transactionbytransaction basis 

 

product delivery  – software and the corresponding access keys are generally delivered to customers electronically electronic delivery occurs when we provide the customer access to the software occasionally we will deliver the software on a compact disc with standard transfer terms of freeonboard or fob shipping point our software license agreements generally do not contain conditions for acceptance with respect to hardware delivery of an entire system is deemed to occur upon its successful installation for certain hardware products installation is the responsibility of the customer as the system is fully functional at the time of shipment for these products delivery is deemed to be complete when the products are shipped with freight terms of fob shipping point 

 

for customers who purchase eda gold or eda platinum cards delivery occurs when the customer has been provided with access codes that allow the customer to download the software pursuant to the terms of the software license agreement 

 

fee is fixed or determinable  – we assess whether a fee is fixed or determinable at the outset of the arrangement primarily based on the payment terms associated with the transaction we have established a history of collecting under the original contract without providing concessions on payments products or services for our installment contracts that do not include a substantial up front payment we only consider that a fee is fixed or determinable if the arrangement has payment periods that are equal to or less than the term of the licenses and the payments are collected in equal or nearly equal installments when evaluated over the entire term of the arrangement we have a history of collecting receivables under installment contracts of up to five years 

 

significant judgment is involved in assessing whether a fee is fixed or determinable we must also make these judgments when assessing whether a contract amendment to a term arrangement primarily in the context of a license extension or renewal constitutes a concession our experience has been that we are able to determine whether a fee is fixed or determinable for term licenses while we do not expect that experience to change if we no longer were to have a history of collecting under the original contract without providing concessions on term licenses revenue from term licenses would be required to be recognized when payments under the installment contract become due and payable such a change could have a material impact on our results of operations 

 

collection is probable  – we assess the probability of collecting from each customer at the outset of the arrangement based on a number of factors including the customer’s payment history and its current creditworthiness we have concluded that collection is not probable for license arrangements executed with customers in certain countries if in our judgment collection of a fee is not probable we defer the revenue until the uncertainty is removed which generally means revenue is recognized upon receipt of cash payment our experience has been that we are able to estimate whether collection is probable while we do not expect that experience to change if we were to determine that collection is not probable for any license arrangement particularly those with installment payment terms revenue from such license would be recognized generally upon the receipt of cash payment such a change could have a material impact on our results of operations 

 

vendorspecific objective evidence of fair value  – our vsoe for certain product elements of an arrangement is based upon the pricing in comparable transactions when the element is sold separately vsoe for maintenance is generally based upon the customer’s stated annual renewal rates vsoe for services is generally based on the price charged when the services are sold separately for multiple element arrangements vsoe must exist to allocate the total fee among all delivered and undelivered elements of a term or perpetual license arrangement if vsoe does not exist for all elements to support the allocation of the total fee among all delivered and undelivered elements of the arrangement revenue is deferred until such evidence does exist for the undelivered elements or until all elements are delivered whichever is earlier if vsoe of all undelivered elements exists but vsoe does not exist for one or 

more delivered elements revenue is recognized using the residual method under the residual method the vsoe of the undelivered elements is deferred and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee is recognized as revenue as the elements are delivered our experience has been that we are able to determine vsoe for maintenance and timebased services but not for product 

 

finance fee revenue  – finance fees result from discounting to present value the product revenue derived from our installment contracts in which the payment terms extend beyond one year from the effective date of the contract finance fees are recognized using a method that approximates the effective interest method over the relevant license term and are classified as product revenue finance fee revenue represented approximately 2 of total revenue for each of the years ended december 29 2007 december 30 2006 and december 31 2005 upon the sale of an installment contract we recognize the remaining finance fee revenue associated with the installment contract 

 

services revenue  – services revenue consists primarily of revenue received for performing design and methodology services these services are not related to the functionality of the products licensed revenue from service contracts is recognized either on the time and materials method as work is performed or on the percentageofcompletion method for contracts with fixed or nottoexceed fees we estimate on a monthly basis the percentageofcompletion which is based on the completion of milestones relating to the arrangement we have a history of accurately estimating project status and the costs necessary to complete projects a number of internal and external factors can affect our estimates including labor rates utilization and efficiency variances and specification and testing requirement changes if different conditions were to prevail such that accurate estimates could not be made then the use of the completed contract method would be required and the recognition of all revenue and costs would be deferred until the project was completed such a change could have a material impact on our results of operations 

 

accounting for income taxes 

 

we provide for the effect of income taxes in our consolidated financial statements in accordance with sfas no 109 “accounting for income taxes” and fin no 48 

 

under sfas no 109 income tax expense or benefit is recognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and for deferred tax assets and liabilities for the tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity’s financial statements or tax returns we must make significant assumptions judgments and estimates to determine our current provision for income taxes our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance to be recorded against our deferred tax assets our judgments assumptions and estimates relating to the current provision for income taxes include the geographic mix and amount of income our interpretation of current tax laws and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax authorities our judgments also include anticipating the tax positions we will take on tax returns prior to actually preparing and filing the tax returns changes in our business tax laws or our interpretation of tax laws and developments in current and future tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our results of operations financial position or cash flows our assumptions judgments and estimates relating to the value of our net deferred tax assets take into account predictions of the amount and category of future taxable income from various sources including tax planning strategies that would if necessary be implemented to prevent a loss carryforward or tax credit carryforward from expiring unused actual operating results or other events that cause us to change our expectations of the amount and category of income in future years could render our current assumptions judgments and estimates of recoverable net deferred taxes inaccurate thus materially affecting our consolidated financial position or results of operations 

 

under fin no 48 we may only recognize an income tax position in our financial statements that we judge is “more likely than not” to be sustained solely on its technical merits in a tax audit including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes to make this judgment we must interpret the application of complex and sometimes ambiguous tax laws regulations and practices if an income tax position meets the “more likely than not” recognition threshold then we must measure the amount of the tax benefit to be recognized by determining the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than a 50 likelihood of being realized upon effective settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all of the relevant facts it is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts as this requires us to determine the probability of various possible settlement outcomes to determine if a tax position is effectively settled we must also estimate the likelihood that a taxing authority would review a tax position after a tax examination had otherwise been completed we must also determine when it is 

reasonably possible that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits will significantly increase or decrease in the 12 months after each reporting date these judgments are difficult because a taxing authority may change its behavior as a result of our disclosures in our financial statements that are based on the requirements of fin no 48 we must reevaluate our income tax positions on a quarterly basis to consider factors such as changes in facts or circumstances changes in tax law effectively settled issues under audit and new audit activity such a change in recognition or measurement would result in recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision 

 

valuation of stockbased awards 

 

we account for stockbased compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 123r “sharebased payment” under sfas no 123r stockbased compensation expense is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period determining the fair value of stockbased awards at the grant date requires judgment including estimating the following 

 

  

the computation of the expected volatility assumption used in the blackscholes pricing model for option grants is based on implied volatility calculated using the volatility of publicly traded options for our common stock we use this approach to determine volatility because 

 

  

when establishing the expected life assumption we review annual historical employee exercise behavior with respect to option grants having similar vesting periods in addition judgment is required in estimating the amount of stockbased awards that we expect to be forfeited we calculate a separate expected forfeiture rate for both stock options and restricted stock issuances based on historical trends the valuation of all options and the expected forfeiture rates for options and restricted stock are calculated based on one employee pool as there is no significant difference in exercise behavior between classes of employees of the 1014 million of stockbased compensation expense recorded during 2007 we used the current year valuation assumptions described above for 178 million of our 2007 stockbased compensation expense for options granted during 2007 and we used prior year valuation assumptions for 312 million of our 2007 stockbased compensation expense for options granted prior to 2007 in addition we expensed 428 million in 2007 related to restricted stock and 96 million related to the performancebased bonus plan described below 

 

judgment is also required to estimate the attainment of certain predetermined performance goals for a performancebased bonus plan under which payments may be made in our common stock each period we estimate the most likely outcome of such performance goals and recognize any related stockbased compensation expense the amount of stockbased compensation expense recognized in any one period can vary based on the attainment or estimated attainment of the various performance goals if such performance goals are not met no compensation expense is recognized and any previously recognized compensation expense is reversed 

 

if actual results differ significantly from these estimates stockbased compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially affected 

 

results of operations 

 

we primarily generate revenue from licensing our eda software selling or leasing our hardware technology providing maintenance for our software and hardware and providing design and methodology services we 

principally utilize three license types subscription term and perpetual the different license types provide a customer with different terms of use for our products such as 

 

  

customer decisions regarding these aspects of license transactions determine the license type timing of revenue recognition and potential future business activity for example if a customer chooses a fixed term of use this will result in either a subscription or term license a business implication of this decision is that at the expiration of the license period the customer must decide whether to continue using the technology and therefore renew the license agreement because larger customers generally use products from two or more of our five product groups rarely will a large customer completely terminate its relationship with us at expiration of the license see the discussion under the heading “critical accounting estimates” above for an additional description of license types and timing of revenue recognition 

 

although we believe that pricing volatility has not generally been a material component of the change in our revenue from period to period we believe that the amount of revenue recognized in future periods will depend on among other things the competitiveness of our new technology the length of our sales cycle and the size duration terms type and timing of our 

 

  

a substantial portion of our total revenue is recognized over multiple periods however a significant portion of our product revenue is recognized upon delivery of licensed software which generally occurs upon the later of the effective date of the arrangement or delivery of the software product 

 

the value and duration of contracts and consequently product revenue recognized is affected by the competitiveness of our products product revenue recognized in any period is also affected by the extent to which customers purchase subscription term or perpetual licenses and the extent to which contracts contain flexible payment terms the timing of revenue recognition is also affected by changes in the extent to which existing contracts contain flexible payment terms and by changes in contractual arrangements with existing customers eg customers transitioning from subscription license arrangements to term license arrangements 

 

revenue and revenue mix 

 

we analyze our software and hardware businesses by product group combining revenues for both product and maintenance because of their interrelationship we have formulated a design solution strategy that combines our design technologies into “platforms” which are included in the various product groups described below 

 

our product groups are 

 

functional verification products in this group which include the incisive functional verification platform are used to verify that the high level logical representation of an ic design is functionally correct 

 

digital ic design products in this group which include the encounter digital ic design platform are used to accurately convert the highlevel logical representation of a digital ic into a detailed physical blueprint and then detailed design information showing how the ic will be physically implemented this data is used for creation of the photomasks used in chip manufacture 

 

custom ic design our custom design products which include the virtuoso custom design platform are used for ics that must be designed at the transistor level including analog radio frequency memories high performance digital blocks and standard cell libraries detailed design information showing how an ic will be physically implemented is used for creation of the photomasks used in chip manufacture 

 

system interconnect design this product group consists of our pcb and ic package design products including the allegro and orcad products the allegro system interconnect design platform enables consistent codesign of interconnects across ics ic packages and pcbs while the orcad line focuses on costeffective entrylevel pcb solutions 

design for manufacturing included in this product group are our physical verification and analysis products these products are used to analyze and verify that the physical blueprint of the integrated circuit has been constructed correctly and can be manufactured successfully 

 

revenue by year 

 

the following table shows our revenue for the fiscal years 2007 2006 and 2005 and the percentage change in revenue between years 

 

 

 

2007 compared to 2006 

 

product revenue was higher in 2007 as compared to 2006 primarily because of increased revenue from licenses for digital ic design functional verification and custom ic design products partially offset by a small decrease in revenue from licenses for dfm products digital ic design was the fastest growing platform in 2007 

 

2006 compared to 2005 

 

product revenue was higher in 2006 as compared to 2005 primarily because of increased revenue from licenses for functional verification and custom ic design products partially offset by a small decrease in revenue from licenses for dfm products functional verification was the fastest growing platform in 2006 

 

revenue by product group 

 

the following table shows the percentage of product and related maintenance revenue contributed by each of our five product groups and services and other in fiscal 2007 2006 and 2005 

 

 

 

as described under the heading “critical accounting estimates” above certain of our licenses allow customers the ability to remix among software products additionally we have licensed a combination of our products to customers with the actual product selection and number of licensed users to be determined at a later date for these arrangements we estimate the allocation of the revenue to product groups based upon the expected usage of our products by these customers the actual usage of our products by these customers may differ and if that proves to be the case the revenue allocation in the above table would differ 

 

although we believe the methodology of allocating revenue to product groups is reasonable there can be no assurance that such allocated amounts reflect the amounts that would result had the customer individually licensed each specific software solution at the onset of the arrangement 

revenue by geography 

 

 

 

revenue by geography as a percentage of total revenue 

 

 

 

the rate of revenue change varies geographically primarily due to differences in the timing and size of term licenses in those regions no single customer accounted for 10 or more of total revenue in 2007 2006 or 2005 

 

changes in foreign currency exchange rates caused our revenue to increase by 29 million in 2007 compared to 2006 primarily due to a decrease in the valuation of the united states dollar when compared to the european union euro and the british pound partially offset by an increase in the valuation of the united states dollar when compared to the japanese yen changes in foreign currency exchange rates caused our revenue to decrease 120 million in 2006 as compared to 2005 primarily due to an increase in the valuation of the united states dollar when compared to the japanese yen additional information about revenue and other financial information by geography can be found in note 22 to our consolidated financial statements 

 

stockbased compensation expense summary 

 

stockbased compensation expense is reflected throughout our costs and expenses in fiscal 2007 2006 and 2005 as follows 

 

 

cost of revenue 

 

 

 

cost of revenue as a percentage of related revenue 

 

 

 

cost of product includes costs associated with the sale or lease of our hardware and licensing of our software products cost of product primarily includes the cost of employee salary benefits and other employeerelated costs including stockbased compensation expense amortization of acquired intangibles directly related to cadence products the cost of technical documentation and royalties payable to thirdparty vendors cost of product associated with our hardware products also includes materials assembly and overhead these additional manufacturing costs make our cost of hardware product higher as a percentage of revenue than our cost of software product 

 

a summary of cost of product in fiscal 2007 2006 and 2005 is as follows 

 

 

 

2007 compared to 2006 

 

cost of product decreased 67 million in 2007 as compared to 2006 primarily due to 

 

  

2006 compared to 2005 

 

cost of product decreased 129 million in 2006 as compared to 2005 primarily due to 

 

  

cost of product depends primarily upon the extent to which we acquire intangible assets acquire licenses and incorporate thirdparty technology in our products that are licensed or sold in any given period and the actual mix of hardware and software product sales in any given period 

 

cost of services primarily includes employee salary benefits and other employeerelated costs costs to maintain the infrastructure necessary to manage a services organization and provisions for contract losses if any there were no material fluctuations in these components of cost of services during 2007 as compared to 2006 or during 2006 as compared to 2005

amortization of acquired intangibles decreased 37 million in 2007 as compared to 2006 primarily due to a decrease of 87 million resulting from the full amortization of certain acquired intangibles which was partially offset by 50 million resulting from intangibles acquired during 2006 and 2007

restructuring and other charges 

 

we initiated a separate plan of restructuring in each year from 2001 through 2005 in an effort to operate more efficiently a summary of restructuring and other charges in fiscal years 2007 2006 and 2005 is as follows 

 

 

 

on october 5 2007 we completed a lease termination agreement for a facility included in the 2001 restructuring plan whereby we paid 82 million and were released from all future obligations related to the facility we recorded a credit to restructuring and other charges of 71 million during the year ended december 29 2007 representing the lease loss accrual related to this facility in excess of the amount paid 

 

during 2005 we recorded restructuring and other charges of 353 million which included 204 million of workforce reduction costs associated primarily with our 2005 restructuring plan and excess facility costs of 125 million which consisted primarily of changes in lease loss estimates for facilities included in our 2001 2002 and 2003 restructuring plans 

 

each reporting period we evaluate the adequacy of the lease loss accrual we adjust the lease loss accrual for changes in real estate markets or other factors that may affect estimated costs or sublease income we also consider executed sublease agreements and adjust the lease loss accrual if sublease income under the agreement differs from initial estimates the credits recorded during 2007 and 2006 primarily relate to changes in lease loss estimates 

 

as of december 29 2007 our total amount accrued for restructuring and other charges of 102 million consisted solely of estimated lease losses related to the restructuring activities initiated since 2001 this amount may be adjusted in the future based upon changes in the assumptions used to estimate the lease loss 

 

because the restructuring charges and related benefits are derived from management’s estimates made during the formulation of the restructurings based on thencurrently available information our restructuring activities may not achieve the benefits anticipated on the timetable or at the level contemplated demand for our products and 

services and ultimately our future financial performance is difficult to predict with any degree of certainty accordingly additional actions including further restructuring of our operations may be required in the future 

 

writeoff of acquired inprocess research and development 

 

upon consummation of an acquisition we immediately charge to expense any acquired inprocess research and development that has not yet reached technological feasibility and has no alternative future use the value assigned to acquired inprocess research and development is determined by identifying research projects in areas for which technological feasibility has not been established the values are determined by estimating costs to develop the acquired inprocess research and development into commercially viable products estimating the resulting net cash flows from such projects and discounting the net cash flows back to their present value the discount rates utilized include a factor that reflects the uncertainty surrounding successful development of the acquired inprocess research and development 

 

the following table summarizes our writeoffs of acquired inprocess research and development charges in fiscal 2007 2006 and 2005 

 

 

 

the following table summarizes as of december 29 2007 the status of inprocess research and development acquired in fiscal 2007 2006 and 2005 

 

 

 

loss on extinguishment of debt 

 

we recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of 408 million during the year ended december 30 2006 which includes a premium paid to repurchase a portion of the 2023 notes of 389 million and a writeoff of the related portion of unamortized deferred costs of issuing the 2023 notes of 19 million 

 

interest expense 

 

 

2007 compared to 2006 

 

during 2007 the primary component of interest expense was the convertible senior notes which were issued in december 2006 during 2006 the primary component of interest expense was our term loan the repayment of which was completed in march 2007 

 

2006 compared to 2005 

 

interest expense increased 69 million in 2006 as compared to 2005 primarily due to the increased interest of 64 million related to our term loan which was entered into on december 19 2005 and the repayment of which was completed in march 2007 

 

other income net 

 

other income net for fiscal 2007 2006 and 2005 was as follows 

 

 

 

the increases in interest income in 2007 as compared to 2006 and in 2006 as compared to 2005 were due to increases in our cash and cash equivalents balances as well as higher interest rates applicable to those balances 

 

in january 2006 khimetrics inc a cost method investment held by telos venture partners a limited partnership in which we and our 1996 deferred compensation venture investment plan trust are the sole limited partners was sold for consideration of 653 per share of common stock in connection with this sale we received approximately 202 million in cash and recorded a gain of approximately 171 million during the year ended december 30 2006 in addition our 1996 deferred compensation venture investment plan trust received 29 million in cash and recorded a gain of 25 million during the year ended december 30 2006 under the purchase agreement an additional 10 of the consideration was held in escrow which was released to us and to the trust in january 2007 upon receipt of these additional proceeds we recorded a gain of 26 million and our 1996 deferred compensation venture investment plan trust recorded a gain of 04 million in the year ended december 29 2007 

 

provision for income taxes 

 

the provision for income taxes and the effective tax rates in fiscal 2007 2006 and 2005 were as follows 

 

 

2007 compared to 2006 

 

our effective tax rate decreased in 2007 as compared to 2006 primarily due to the decrease in net unrecognized tax benefit of 278 million as a result of the effective settlement of certain tax matters with the irs in december 2007 and an increase in benefit from foreign income which is taxed at a lower rate than the united states federal statutory income tax rate of 306 million resulting from the conclusion of certain transfer pricing arrangements with a foreign subsidiary in 2006 

 

we currently expect the effective tax rate for 2008 to be approximately 33 the increase in the expected 2008 effective tax rate as compared to 2007 is primarily due to the 2007 effective settlement of certain tax positions with the irs and the expiration of the federal research tax credits after december 31 2007 neither of which is expected to provide tax benefits in 2008 

 

2006 compared to 2005 

 

our effective tax rate decreased in 2006 as compared to 2005 primarily due to the 301 million of federal state and foreign income taxes incurred upon our 2005 repatriation of 5000 million of certain foreign earnings under the american jobs creation act which increased the 2005 annual effective tax rate by approximately 23 percentage points 

 

deferred tax assets and irs examinations 

 

as of december 29 2007 we had total net deferred tax assets of approximately 2506 million realization of the deferred tax assets will depend on generating sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character prior to the expiration of certain net operating loss capital loss and tax credit carryforwards although realization is not assured we believe it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets will be realized the amount of the net deferred tax assets however could be reduced or increased in the near term if actual facts including the estimate of future taxable income differ from those estimated 

 

the internal revenue service or irs and other tax authorities regularly examine our income tax returns in november 2003 the irs completed its field examination of our federal income tax returns for the tax years 1997 through 1999 and issued a revenue agent’s report or rar in which the irs proposed to assess an aggregate tax deficiency for the threeyear period of approximately 1430 million the most significant of the disputed adjustments for the tax years 1997 through 1999 related to transfer pricing arrangements that we had with a foreign subsidiary in december 2007 the joint committee on taxation of the us congress or the joint committee approved and the appeals office executed settlement agreements resulting in an effective settlement of the transfer pricing dispute for purposes of fin no 48 as a result of this effective settlement we recognized a tax benefit of 278 million in our consolidated income statement 

 

we did not reach a settlement with the appeals office of the irs on separate tax refund claims that would increase our tax deductions for foreign trade income for the tax years 1997 through 1999 we continue to believe that our position is well supported and we are currently considering our options for further pursuing this matter 

 

in july 2006 the irs completed its field examination of our federal income tax returns for the tax years 2000 through 2002 and issued an rar in which the irs proposed to assess an aggregate tax deficiency for the threeyear period of approximately 3240 million in november 2006 the irs revised the proposed aggregate tax deficiency for the threeyear period to be approximately 3180 million the irs is contesting our qualification for deferred recognition of certain proceeds received from restitution and settlement in connection with litigation during the period the proposed tax deficiency for this item is approximately 1520 million the remaining proposed tax deficiency of approximately 1660 million is primarily related to proposed adjustments to our transfer pricing arrangements that we had with foreign subsidiaries and to our deductions for foreign trade income the irs may make similar claims against our transfer pricing arrangements and deductions for foreign trade income in future examinations we have filed a timely protest with the irs and will seek resolution of the issues with the appeals office 

 

we believe that the proposed irs adjustments are inconsistent with applicable tax laws and we are vigorously challenging these proposed adjustments the rar is not a final statutory notice of deficiency but the irs imposes interest on the proposed deficiencies until the matters are resolved interest is compounded daily at rates published 

by the irs which rates are adjusted quarterly and have been between 4 and 10 since 2001 the irs is currently examining our federal income tax returns for the tax years 2003 through 2005 

 

significant judgment is required in applying the principles of fin no 48 and sfas no 109 the calculation of our provision for income taxes involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes we regularly assess the potential settlement outcomes resulting from income tax examinations however the final outcome of tax examinations including the total amount payable or the timing of any such payments upon resolution of these issues cannot be estimated with certainty in addition we cannot be certain that such amount will not be materially different than that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals should the irs or other tax authorities assess additional taxes as a result of a current or a future examination we may be required to record charges to operations in future periods that could have a material impact on our results of operations financial position or cash flows in the applicable period or periods 

 

liquidity and capital resources 

 

 

 

cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments 

 

as of december 29 2007 our principal sources of liquidity consisted of 10781 million of cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments as compared to 9584 million as of december 30 2006 and 8946 million as of december 31 2005 the primary sources of our cash in 2007 and 2006 were

 44 

  

cash flows from operating activities 

 

cash flows from operating activities are provided by net income adjusted for certain noncash charges such as depreciation amortization and stockbased compensation as well as changes in the balance of certain assets and liabilities our cash flows from operating activities are significantly influenced by the payment terms set forth in our license agreements and by sales of our receivables 

 

we have entered into agreements whereby we may transfer accounts receivable to certain financing institutions on a nonrecourse or limitedrecourse basis these transfers are recorded as sales and accounted for in accordance with sfas no 140 “accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities” during 2007 we transferred accounts receivable net of the losses on the sale of the receivables totaling 2154 million which approximated fair value to financing institutions on a nonrecourse basis as compared to 1806 million in 2006 and 1921 million in 2005 as a result of the credit losses recorded by banks in the second half of 2007 a number of banks have become less willing to purchase assets because of capital constraints and concerns about overexposure to the technology sector and we expect a reduced level of proceeds from the sale of receivables in 2008 

 

net cash provided by operating activities of 4024 million for the year ended december 29 2007 was primarily comprised of 

 

  

net cash provided by operating activities of 4212 million for the year ended december 30 2006 was primarily comprised of

2007 compared to 2006 

 

net cash used for investing activities decreased by 33 million in 2007 as compared to 2006 the decrease was primarily due to 

 

  

in january 2007 we completed the sale of certain land and buildings in san jose california for a sales price of 465 million in cash concurrently with the sale we leased back from the purchaser all available space in the buildings during the lease term we are constructing an additional building located on our san jose california campus to replace the buildings we sold in this transaction we used 210 million in cash during 2007 for construction of this new building 

 

we expect to continue our investing activities including purchasing property plant and equipment purchasing intangible assets purchasing software licenses and making longterm equity investments 

 

2006 compared to 2005 

 

net cash used for investing activities decreased by 1109 million in 2006 as compared to 2005 the decrease was primarily due to 

 

  

cash flows from financing activities 

 

financing cash flows during 2007 consisted primarily of the issuance of common stock under certain employee plans and purchases of treasury stock 

 

2007 compared to 2006 

 

net cash used for financing activities was 1701 million in 2007 as compared to net cash provided by financing activities of 2339 million in 2006 the change was primarily due to

2006 compared to 2005 

 

net cash used for financing activities was 2339 million in 2006 as compared to net cash provided by financing activities of 2053 million in 2005 the change was primarily due to

we adopted the provisions of fin no 48 on december 31 2006 which was the first day of our 2007 fiscal year we recognized a 594 million decrease in the net liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits which was accounted for as an increase to the december 31 2006 balance of retained earnings we also recognized a 426 million decrease in the net liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits which was accounted for as a 353 million increase in the december 31 2006 balance of common stock and capital in excess of par value and a 73 million decrease in the december 31 2006 balance of goodwill 

 

upon adoption of fin no 48 we also recognized additional longterm income tax assets of 1150 million and additional longterm income tax liabilities of 1150 million to present the unrecognized tax benefits as gross amounts on the consolidated balance sheet we also decreased current income tax liabilities by 262 million and increased longterm income tax liabilities by the same amount based on our anticipation of the amount of cash payments to be made within one year

we believe that the proposed irs adjustments are inconsistent with applicable tax laws and we are vigorously challenging these proposed adjustments the rar is not a final statutory notice of deficiency but the irs imposes interest on the proposed deficiencies until the matters are resolved interest is compounded daily at rates published by the irs which rates are adjusted quarterly and have been between 4 and 10 since 2001 

1375 convertible senior notes due 2011 and 1500 convertible senior notes due 2013

with respect to purchase obligations that are cancelable by us the table includes the amount that would have been payable if we had canceled the obligation as of december 29 2007 or the earliest cancellation date 

 

in connection with our acquisitions completed prior to december 29 2007 we may be obligated to pay up to an aggregate of 450 million in cash during the next 53 months if certain predefined performance goals are achieved in full 

 

we expect that current cash and shortterm investment balances and cash flows that are generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital and other capital requirements for at least the next 12 months 

 

as of december 29 2007 we did not have any significant offbalance sheet arrangements as defined in item 303a4ii of sec regulation sk 

 

new accounting standards 

 

in december 2007 the fasb issued sfas no 141r “business combinations” and sfas no 160 “noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements an amendment of accounting research bulletin no 51” sfas no 141r will change how business acquisitions are accounted for and will impact financial statements both on the acquisition date and in subsequent periods sfas no 160 will change the accounting and reporting for minority interests which will be recharacterized as noncontrolling interests and classified as a component of equity sfas no 141r and sfas no 160 are effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2008 early adoption is not permitted we are currently evaluating the impact that sfas no 141r and sfas no 160 will have on our consolidated financial statements 

 

in february 2007 the fasb issued sfas no 159 “the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities” under sfas no 159 companies may elect to measure certain financial instruments and certain other items at fair value the standard requires that unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected be reported in earnings sfas no 159 is effective for fiscal years beginning after november 15 2007 we are currently evaluating the impact that sfas no 159 will have on our consolidated financial statements 

 

in september 2006 the fasb issued sfas no 157 “fair value measurements” which defines fair value establishes guidelines for measuring fair value and expands disclosures regarding fair value measurements sfas no 157 does not require any new fair value measurements but rather eliminates inconsistencies in guidance found in various prior accounting pronouncements sfas no 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after november 15 2007 however on february 12 2008 the fasb issued fsp fas no 1572 which delays the effective date of sfas no 157 for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis at least annually to fiscal years beginning after november 15 2008 and interim periods within those fiscal years for items within the scope of fsp fas no 1572 effective for fiscal 2008 we will adopt sfas no 157 except as it applies to those nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities as described in fsp fas no 1572 we are currently evaluating the impact that sfas no 157 will have on our consolidated financial statements 

 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

 

interest rate risk 

 

our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our portfolio of cash and cash equivalents while we are exposed to interest rate fluctuations in many of the world’s leading industrialized countries our interest income and expense is most sensitive to fluctuations in the general level of united states interest rates in this regard changes in united states interest rates affect the interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents and costs associated with foreign currency hedges 

 

we invest in high quality credit issuers and by policy limit the amount of our credit exposure to any one issuer as part of our policy our first priority is to reduce the risk of principal loss consequently we seek to preserve our invested funds by limiting default risk market risk and reinvestment risk we mitigate default risk by investing in only high quality credit securities that we believe to have low credit risk and by positioning our portfolio to respond 

appropriately to a significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor the shortterm interestbearing portfolio of cash and cash equivalents includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity 

 

all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase are considered to be cash equivalents investments with maturities greater than three months are classified as availableforsale and are considered to be shortterm investments the carrying value of our interestbearing instruments approximated fair value as of december 29 2007 the following table presents the carrying value and related weighted average interest rates for our interestbearing instruments which are all classified as cash and cash equivalents on our consolidated balance sheet as of december 29 2007 

 

 

 

foreign currency risk 

 

most of our revenue expenses and material business activity are transacted in the united states dollar however certain of our operations include transactions in foreign currencies and therefore we benefit from a weaker dollar and in certain countries where we invoice customers in the local currency we are adversely affected by a stronger dollar relative to major currencies worldwide the primary effect of foreign currency transactions on our results of operations from a weakening united states dollar is an increase in revenue offset by a smaller increase in expenses conversely the primary effect of foreign currency transactions on our results of operations from a strengthening united states dollar is a reduction in revenue offset by a smaller reduction in expenses 

 

we enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts with financial institutions to protect against currency exchange risks associated with existing assets and liabilities a foreign currency forward exchange contract acts as a hedge by increasing in value when underlying assets decrease in value or underlying liabilities increase in value due to changes in foreign exchange rates conversely a foreign currency forward exchange contract decreases in value when underlying assets increase in value or underlying liabilities decrease in value due to changes in foreign exchange rates these forward contracts are not designated as accounting hedges under sfas no 133 “accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities” and therefore the unrealized gains and losses are recognized in other income net in advance of the actual foreign currency cash flows with the fair value of these forward contracts being recorded as accrued liabilities or other current assets 

 

our policy governing hedges of foreign currency risk does not allow us to use forward contracts for trading purposes our forward contracts generally have maturities of 90 days or less the effectiveness of our hedging program depends on our ability to estimate future asset and liability exposures we enter into currency forward exchange contracts based on estimated future asset and liability exposures recognized gains and losses with respect to our current hedging activities will ultimately depend on how accurately we are able to match the amount of currency forward exchange contracts with actual underlying asset and liability exposures 

 

the following table provides information as of december 29 2007 about our forward foreign currency contracts the information is provided in united states dollar equivalent amounts the table presents the notional amounts at contract exchange rates and the weighted average contractual foreign currency exchange rates expressed as units of the foreign currency per united states dollar which in some cases may not be the market 

convention for quoting a particular currency all of these forward contracts matured prior to or during february 2008 

 

 

 

while we actively monitor our foreign currency risks there can be no assurance that our foreign currency hedging activities will substantially offset the impact of fluctuations in currency exchange rates on our results of operations cash flows and financial position 

 

equity price risk 

 

1375 convertible senior notes due 2011 and 1500 convertible senior notes due 2013 

 

in december 2006 we issued 2500 million principal amount of 1375 convertible senior notes due 2011 or the 2011 notes and 2500 million of 1500 convertible senior notes due 2013 or the 2013 notes and collectively the convertible senior notes to three initial purchasers in a private placement pursuant to section 42 of the securities act for resale to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to sec rule 144a concurrently with the issuance of the convertible senior notes we entered into hedge transactions with various parties and in separate transactions sold warrants to various parties to reduce the potential dilution from the conversion of the convertible senior notes and to mitigate any negative effect such conversion may have on the price of our common stock for an additional description of the convertible senior notes including the hedge and warrants transactions see the discussion under the heading “item 7 – liquidity and capital resources – factors affecting liquidity and capital resources” above 

 

zero coupon zero yield senior convertible notes due 2023 

 

in august 2003 we issued 4200 million principal amount of our 2023 notes to two initial purchasers in a private placement pursuant to section 42 of the securities act for resale to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to sec rule 144a concurrently with the issuance of the 2023 notes we entered into hedge transactions with one of the initial purchasers and in a separate transaction sold warrants to one of the initial purchasers to reduce the potential dilution from the conversion of the 2023 notes and to mitigate any negative effect such conversion may have on the price of our common stock for an additional description of the 2023 notes including the hedge and warrants transactions see the discussion under the heading “item 7 – liquidity and capital resources – factors affecting liquidity and capital resources” above 

 

investments 

 

we have a portfolio of equity investments that includes marketable equity securities and nonmarketable equity securities our equity investments are made primarily in connection with our strategic investment program under our strategic investment program from time to time we make cash investments in companies with technologies that are potentially strategically important to us 

the fair value of our portfolio of availableforsale marketable equity securities which are included in shortterm investments on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets was 149 million as of december 29 2007 and 237 million as of december 30 2006 while we actively monitor these investments we do not currently engage in any hedging activities to reduce or eliminate equity price risk with respect to these equity investments accordingly we could lose all or part of our investment portfolio of marketable equity securities if there is an adverse change in the market prices of the companies we invest in 

 

our investments in nonmarketable equity securities would be negatively affected by an adverse change in equity market prices although the impact cannot be directly quantified such a change or any negative change in the financial performance or prospects of the companies whose nonmarketable securities we own would harm the ability of these companies to raise additional capital and the likelihood of our being able to realize any gains or return of our investments through liquidity events such as initial public offerings acquisitions and private sales these types of investments involve a high degree of risk and there can be no assurance that any company we invest in will grow or will be successful or that we will be able to liquidate a particular investment when desired accordingly we could lose all or part of our investment 

 

our investments in nonmarketable equity securities had a carrying amount of 262 million as of december 29 2007 and 314 million as of december 30 2006 if we determine that an otherthantemporary decline in fair value exists for a nonmarketable equity security we write down the investment to its fair value and record the related writedown as an investment loss in our consolidated income statements

 item 9a controls and procedures 

 

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

 

we carried out an evaluation required by rule 13a15 of the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended or the exchange act under the supervision and with the participation of our management including the chief executive officer or ceo and the chief financial officer or cfo of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rules 13a15e and 15d15e under the exchange act as of december 29 2007 

the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures included a review of our processes and implementation and the effect on the information generated for use in this annual report on form 10k in the course of this evaluation we sought to identify any material weaknesses in our disclosure controls and procedures to determine whether we had identified any acts of fraud involving personnel who have a significant role in our disclosure controls and procedures and to confirm that any necessary corrective action including process improvements was taken this type of evaluation is done every fiscal quarter so that our conclusions concerning the effectiveness of these controls can be reported in our periodic reports filed with the sec the overall goals of these evaluation activities are to monitor our disclosure controls and procedures and to make modifications as necessary we intend to maintain these disclosure controls and procedures modifying them as circumstances warrant 

 

based on their evaluation as of december 29 2007 our ceo and cfo have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by us in our reports filed or submitted under the exchange act i is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the sec’s rules and forms and ii is accumulated and communicated to our management including the ceo and cfo as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure 

 

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

 

there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the year ended december 29 2007 that materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting 

 

inherent limitations on effectiveness of controls 

 

our management including our ceo and cfo does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all error and all fraud a control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within cadence have been detected 

 

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rule 13a15f under the exchange act our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 29 2007 in making this assessment our management used the criteria established in internal controlintegrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission our management has concluded that as of december 29 2007 our internal control over financial reporting is effective based on these criteria our independent registered public accounting firm kpmg llp has issued an attestation report on our internal control over financial reporting which is included herein

factors driving the electronic design automation industry 

 

communications business productivity and consumer electronics markets drove growth in the electronics industry for most of the past decade however in recent years the consumer market has been the fastest growing end market for electronics and the most influential in setting expectations for rapid change low cost miniaturization and increasing functionality 

 

electronic systems companies respond to these demands by combining subsystems – such as radio frequency wireless communication or rf video signal processing and embedded computing – onto a single silicon chip creating a systemonchip or soc or onto multiple chips in a single chip package in a format referred to as systeminpackage or sip these trends toward subsystem integration have required chip makers to find solutions to challenges previously addressed by system companies such as verifying systemlevel functionality and hardwaresoftware interoperability 

soc designs put many more transistors on each chip increasing the need for tight control over power consumption this is done not only to increase battery life in portable devices but also to minimize energy cost and limit heat generation which threaten the reliability of a device evolving semiconductor manufacturing processes with smaller features transistors and wires and lower supply voltages address both of these issues to some degree but introduce new challenges of their own contemporary portable electronic devices contain chips in which individual features can be as small as 65 nanometers – about 6100000ths of a millimeter because of atomic level interactions in the transistors these chips continue to consume power from the battery even when the device is switched off to overcome these issues specific “low power” design techniques must be developed and must be integrated throughout the design flow from logic design and verification through physical implementation 

 

variability in the processes used to manufacture silicon chips has become so pervasive at 65 nanometers and below that traditional connections between design and manufacturing teams are insufficient to ensure chip performance and yield integrating detailed models of the manufacturing process into the chip design environment is desirable so engineers can craft the design to avoid or overcome these manufacturing process variations similarly manufacturing teams can optimize their processes if along with the design they are provided with information about the most critical parts of the chip however sharing information between design and manufacturing processes is complicated because current data formats used to describe the chip design differ from data formats used to describe the manufacturing process and control the manufacturing equipment moreover design and manufacturing often takes place within two separate companies – one company designs the chip while another company manufactures it 

 

these trends pose significant new challenges for the electronics design processes specifically product performance and size requirements of the mobile consumer electronics market require microelectronic systems to be smaller consume less power and provide multiple functions all in one soc or sip package this requires designers to pay close attention to many electrical physical and manufacturing effects that were inconsequential in previous generations of chip designs the design challenge becomes more complex with each new generation of electronics and providers of eda solutions must deliver products that address these technical challenges while improving the efficiency and productivity of the design process 

 

operating segment 

 

our chief operating decision maker is our president and chief executive officer or ceo our ceo reviews our consolidated results within only one operating segment 

 

products 

 

our products are engineered to improve our customers’ design productivity and resulting design quality by providing a comprehensive set of eda design products product revenues include all fees earned from granting licenses to use our software and from sales and leases of our hardware products and exclude revenues derived from maintenance and services we offer customers three license types for our software perpetual term and subscription see “software licensing arrangements” below for additional discussion of our license types 

 

product revenue was 9827 million or 66 of our total revenue in 2006 8515 million or 64 of our total revenue in 2005 and 7298 million or 61 of our total revenue in 2004 

 

product strategy 

 

with the addition of emerging nanometer design considerations to the already burgeoning set of traditional design tasks complex soc or ic design can no longer be accomplished using a collection of discrete design tools what previously consisted of sequential design activities must be merged and accomplished nearly simultaneously without timeconsuming data translation steps we combine our design technologies into “platforms” for four major design activities functional verification digital ic design custom ic design and system interconnect the four cadence ® design platforms are incisive ® functional verification encounter ® digital ic design virtuoso ® custom design and allegro ® system interconnect platforms in addition we augment these platform product offerings with a comprehensive set of design for manufacturing or dfm products that service both the digital and custom ic design flows these four platforms together with our dfm products comprise our primary product lines 

incisive functional verification platform 

 

the incisive functional verification platform enables our customers to employ enterpriselevel verification process automation including verification planning management and process tracking with coordination of all verification activities across teams of specialists and different execution platforms 

 

the incisive platform is tailored for three customer segments 

 

  

the incisive platform includes verification process automation technologies methodologies and verification intellectual property or ip for many standard protocols products include 

 

  

the incisive plantoclosure methodology supported by technical field experts is designed to enable the scalable deployment of best practices and to mitigate our customers’ language technology and methodology adoption risks 

 

encounter digital ic design platform 

 

the encounter digital ic design platform enables our customers to implement all aspects of their digital nanometerscale designs it is based on a single user interface and unified inmemory data model and is specifically designed to facilitate the analysis and optimization of chip performance power consumption and silicon area and manufacturability throughout our customers’ design processes the encounter platform is comprised of the following core technologies 

 

  

unlike traditional “frontendbackend” systems the encounter platform does not require customers to perform timeconsuming translations between common tasks such as placement power distribution routing and timing and crosstalk analysis the encounter platform supports hierarchical designs with support for designs containing hundreds of millions of transistors on a single chip since 2005 the encounter platform has been offered in three levels encounter l xl and gxl these levels are scaled to provide customers with technologies tailored to specific degrees of design complexity in the digital ic space 

virtuoso custom design platform 

 

the virtuoso custom design platform enables design predictability by ensuring that the circuit design representation will perform correctly in the final manufactured chip with the virtuoso platform designers are able to deliver siliconaccurate analog custom digital rf and mixedsignal designs while addressing the growing number of physical effects in package power grid interconnect devices and substrate employing a “topdown” languagebased design 

 

the virtuoso platform reduces design time by providing 

 

  

the openaccess tm database described below in “third party programs and initiatives” is used as a mechanism for integration across the virtuoso platform 

 

with the 2006 introduction of the virtuoso 610 platform we completed our virtuoso platform product segmentation which began in 2005 the virtuoso l xl and gxl offerings provide our customers with a diverse set of custom design capabilities for entrylevel design to the most complex dfmaware designs 

 

allegro system interconnect design platform 

 

the allegro system interconnect design platform enables design teams to design highperformance interconnect across the domains of ic package and printed circuit board or pcb reducing cost and time to market the system interconnect – between inputoutput buffers and across ics packages and pcbs – can be optimized through the platform’s codesign methodology reducing both hardware costs and design cycles designers use the allegro platform’s constraintdriven methodology and advanced capabilities for design capture signal integrity and physical implementation silicon designin kits speed time to market by allowing ic companies to shorten new device adoption time and allowing systems companies to accelerate pcb system design cycles in 2006 with the release of our sip products we have entered an emerging market designed to accelerate products to market where designers are looking for alternatives between socs and pcbs in 2006 the allegro l xl and gxl products were introduced along with the xl and gxl offerings for cadence’s sip products 

 

the system interconnect product group includes the allegro system interconnect platform the orcad ® product line of pcb design products which are engineered for individual or small design team productivity and a family of ic packaging and sip technologies the orcad product line is marketed worldwide through a network of alternative channel partners 

 

design for manufacturing 

 

the physical layout of each ic requires detailed analysis and optimization to ensure that the design can be manufactured in volume while performing as expected some of our products that deliver dfm capabilities for nanometer soc design include

kits 

 

today’s growing silicon complexity creates an array of design challenges for semiconductor and systems design teams among these challenges is the application of eda technologies to overcome design hurdles in certain key markets driving the semiconductor industry particularly the wireless and digital personal entertainment segments cadence kits are designed to allow companies in these sectors to achieve shorter more predictable design cycles and greater design productivity by greatly simplifying the application and integration of eda technologies and verification ip to address major design challenges in these markets analogmixed signal or ams rf sip low power and verification 

 

each kit addresses applicationspecific design issues by combining a verified methodology and enabling standardsbased ip – all applied to a segment representative design and delivered with application consulting following the introduction of the ams methodology and rf design methodology kits in 2006 we introduced the rf sip methodology kit and the functional verification kit for arm 

 

verification and application specific programming services 

 

we offer verification and application specific programming or asp services through timetomarket engineering or ttme services our ttme offering provides customers with consulting services project services andor complete turnkey services for verification acceleration and system emulation quickcycles allows customers access to our palladium simulation acceleration and emulation products on a payasyougo basis either on the customer internet site or remotely over a highspeed secure network connection 

 

third party programs and initiatives 

 

we recognize that certain of our customers may also use internallydeveloped design tools or design tools provided by other eda companies as well as ip available from multiple suppliers we support the integration of third party design products through our openaccess initiative and connections ® and openchoice programs openaccess is a fullfeatured eda database that supports access and manipulation of its internal eda data via a fully documented and freely available programming interface this provides an open application program interface through which applications developed by our customers by their other eda vendors or by university research groups can all operate within a single database and with our products we have licensed the openaccess database to the openaccess coalition which is operated by the silicon integration initiative or si2 an organization of eda electronic system and semiconductor industry leaders focused on improving productivity and reducing cost in creating and producing integrated silicon systems 

 

the connections program provides other eda companies with access to our products to ensure that our products work well with those third party tools over 130 eda providers are members of the connections program the openchoice program was instituted to enable interoperability and facilitate open collaboration with leading providers of library processor memory core and verification ip to build validate and deliver accurate models optimized for cadence design and verification solutions the program aims to ensure ip quality and provide our customers with access to optimized ip a key component of the openchoice program is to assist and support library 

providers in the integration of our design and verification products and model formats into customerowned tooling or cot library solutions 

 

in 2006 we formed the power forward initiative with a group of 22 electronics industry leaders who recognized the urgent need for an automated poweraware design infrastructure to facilitate the production of ics that consume significantly less power the goal of the group is to participate in the refinement and standardization of the common power format or cpf cpf is a specification language that holistically captures lowpower design intent so that it can be communicated consistently throughout the ic design process we have contributed the cpf specification to si2 which will manage the standardization maintenance and distribution of cpf for the benefit of the electronics industry 

 

in addition we work with vendors of application specific integrated circuits or asics to ensure predictable and smooth handoff of design data from mutual customers to asic implementation these programs foster relationships throughout the silicon design chain with leading ip partners silicon manufacturers and library provider partners to support both asic and cot solutions for our customers they are integral to providing complete design chain solutions to ic and electronic systems designers who depend on coordinated offerings from multiple suppliers 

 

maintenance 

 

we provide technical support to our customers to facilitate their use of our software and hardware products a high level of customer service and support is critical to the adoption and successful use of our products 

 

we have a global customer support organization and specialized field application engineering teams located in each of our operating regions to provide assistance to customers where and when they need it 

 

standard maintenance support includes three major components our sourcelink ® online support portal which provides 24 hour access to realtime technical information on our products contact center support telephone email and web access to our support engineers and software updates periodic updates with regressiontested critical fixes and updated functionality available via cds or secure internet download 

 

maintenance is offered to customers as an integral noncancelable component of our subscription license agreements or as a separate agreement subject to annual renewal for our term and perpetual license customers 

 

some of our customers have relocated or expanded the presence of their design teams away from their headquarters or historical locations to locations in emerging growth regions accordingly to provide responsive and effective support for these customers we expect to continue expanding the presence of our own support and application engineering teams in these emerging growth regions 

 

maintenance revenue was 3663 million or 25 of our total revenue in 2006 3515 million or 26 of our total revenue in 2005 and 3307 million or 28 of our total revenue in 2004 we expect that maintenance revenue in 2007 will be generated predominantly from backlog 

 

services 

 

we offer a number of feebased services including education and engineering services related to ic design and methodology these services may be sold separately or sold and performed in conjunction with the sale lease or license of our products 

 

services revenue was 1349 million or 9 of our total revenue in 2006 1262 million or 9 of our total revenue in 2005 and 1370 million or 11 of our total revenue in 2004 

 

education services 

 

our education services include internet classroom and custom courses the content of which ranges from how to use the most recent features of our eda products to instruction in the latest ic design techniques 

engineering services 

 

we offer engineering services and reusable design technologies to aid customers with the design of complex ics we focus our offerings primarily on soc devices including both asics and application specific standard parts and on analog and mixed signal ics the customers for these services primarily consist of semiconductor and systems companies developing products for the communications computing and consumer markets we offer engineering capabilities to assist customers from product concept through volume manufacturing 

 

we also make our design ip portfolio available to customers as part of our technology and services solutions these reusable design and methodology components enable us to more efficiently deliver our services and allow our customers to reduce the design complexity and time to market for the development of complex socs 

 

in our design and methodology service practices we leverage our cumulative experience and knowledge of design practices across many customers and different design environments to improve our own service teams’ and our customers’ productivity we work with customers using outsourcing consultative and collaborative models depending on their projects and needs our virtual computeraided design or vcad model enables our engineering teams at one or more of our locations to virtually work “sidebyside” with our customers’ teams located elsewhere during the course of their design and engineering projects through a secure private network infrastructure 

 

through collaboration with our customers we are able to design advanced ics and gain direct and early visibility to industry design issues that may not be addressed adequately by today’s eda solutions this enables us to accelerate the development of new software technology and products to meet the market’s current and future design requirements 

 

marketing and sales 

 

we generally use a direct sales force consisting of sales people and applications engineers to market our products and provide maintenance and services to existing and prospective customers applications engineers provide technical presales and postsales support for software products due to the complexity of many of our eda products and the electronic design process in general the sales cycle is generally long requiring three to six months or more during the sales cycle our direct sales force generally provides technical presentations product demonstrations and support for onsite customer evaluation of our software we also use traditional marketing approaches to promote our products and services including advertising direct mail telemarketing trade shows public relations and the internet as eda products mature and become widely understood by the marketplace we selectively utilize value added resellers to broaden our reach and reduce cost of sales all orcad and selected incisive products are primarily marketed through these channels with respect to international sales we generally market and support our products and services through our subsidiaries

we sell software using three license types subscription term and perpetual customers who prefer to license technology for a specified limited period of time will choose either a subscription or term license and customers who prefer to have the right to use the technology continuously without time restriction will choose a perpetual license customers who desire rights to remix in new technology during the life of the contract will select a subscription license which allows them limited access to unspecified new technology on a whenandifavailable basis as opposed to a term or perpetual license which does not include remix rights to new technology payment terms for subscription and term licenses generally provide for payments to be made in installments over the license period and payment terms for perpetual licenses generally are net 30 days 

 

our revenue recognition depends on a number of contractspecific terms and conditions including the license type payment terms creditworthiness of the customer and other factors as more fully described in this annual report under the heading “critical accounting estimates” under item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” revenue associated with subscription licenses is recognized over multiple periods during the license term whereas product revenue associated with term and perpetual licenses is generally recognized upon the later of the effective date of the license or delivery of the product assuming all 

other criteria for revenue recognition have been met although it can vary from quarter to quarter approximately twothirds of our product revenue was recognized from backlog during each of the past three years 

 

our revenue and results of operations may miss expectations due to a shortfall in product revenue generated from current transactions or variance in the actual mix of license types executed in any given period and due to other contractspecific terms and conditions as discussed above we are subject to greater credit risk on subscription and term licenses as compared to perpetual licenses due to the installment payment terms generally associated with those license types otherwise the particular risks to us of one license type versus another type do not vary considerably 

 

from time to time we sell receivables generated by our licenses with installment payment terms to third party financing institutions on a nonrecourse or limitedrecourse basis 

 

for a further description of our license agreements revenue recognition policies and results of operations please refer to the discussion under the heading “critical accounting estimates” under item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” 

 

research and development 

 

our investment in research and development was 4601 million in 2006 3907 million in 2005 and 3681 million in 2004 

 

the primary areas of our research and development include soc design the design of silicon devices in the nanometer range highperformance ic packaging sip and pcb design systemlevel modeling and verification highperformance logic verification technology and hardwaresoftware coverification because the electronics industry combines rapid innovation with rapidly increasing design and manufacturing complexity we make significant investments in enhancing our current products as well as creating new products and technologies and integrating those products and technologies together into segmented solutions 

 

our future performance depends largely on our ability to maintain and enhance our current product development and commercialization to meet advancing semiconductor manufacturing capability and design complexity develop acquire or interface to new products from third parties and develop solutions that meet increasingly demanding productivity quality predictability and cost requirements in addition to our research and development team we maintain cadence laboratories an advanced research group responsible for exploring specific new technologies moving those technologies into product development and maintaining strong industry relationships 

 

manufacturing and distribution 

 

our software production consists of configuring the customer’s order outsourcing the recording of the product electronically or on cdrom and producing customerunique access keys that allow customers to use licensed products software and documentation are primarily distributed to customers by secure electronic delivery user manuals and other documentation are generally available by secure electronic delivery or on cdrom but are occasionally supplied in hard copy format 

 

cadence performs final assembly and test of its hardware verification acceleration and emulation products in san jose california subcontractors manufacture all major subassemblies including all individual pcbs and custom ics and supply them to us for qualification and testing prior to their incorporation into the assembled product 

 

proprietary technology 

 

our success depends in part upon our proprietary technology we generally rely on patents copyrights trademarks trade secret laws licenses and restrictive agreements to establish and protect our proprietary rights in technology and products many of our products include software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties we may have to seek new licenses or renew existing licenses for this third party software and other intellectual property in the future as part of performing design and methodology services for customers our design 

and methodology services business licenses certain software and other intellectual property of third parties including that of our competitors 

 

competition 

 

we compete in the eda market for products and maintenance primarily with three companies synopsys inc mentor graphics corporation and magma design automation inc we also compete with numerous smaller eda companies with manufacturers of electronic devices that have developed or have the capability to develop their own eda products and with numerous electronics design and consulting companies we generally compete on the basis of product quality product features integration in a platform or compatibility with other tools price payment terms and maintenance offerings 

 

our maintenance business flows directly from our product business the competitive issues associated with our maintenance business are substantially the same as those for our product business in that every maintenance contract is the direct result of a product contract and once we have entered into a product contract maintenance is generally purchased by the customer to ensure access to bug fixes and service releases as and when they are made available and other continued support 

 

certain competitive factors in the design and methodology services business as described herein differ from those of the products and maintenance businesses while we do compete with other eda companies in the design and methodology services business we compete more with independent design and methodology service businesses these companies vary greatly in focus geographic location capability cost structure and pricing in addition manufacturers of electronic devices may be reluctant to purchase services from independent vendors such as cadence because they wish to promote their own internal design departments we compete with these companies by focusing on the design of complex analog and digital ics it is our strategy to use design and methodology services as a differentiator to further promote our products and maintenance businesses 

 

backlog 

 

our backlog on december 30 2006 was approximately 19 billion as compared to 18 billion on december 31 2005 backlog consists of revenue to be recognized in future fiscal periods after december 30 2006 from 

 

  

the substantial majority of our backlog is generated by our product and maintenance businesses because customer licenses generally include both product and maintenance components historically we have not experienced significant cancellations of our contracts with customers however we often reschedule the required completion dates of design and methodology services contracts which at times defers revenue recognition under those contracts beyond the original expected completion date changes in customer license types or payment terms also can impact the timing of revenue recognition 

 

revenue seasonality 

 

historically orders and revenue have been lowest in our first quarter and highest in our fourth quarter with a material decline between the fourth quarter of one year and the first quarter of the next year we expect the first quarter will remain our lowest quarter for orders and revenues orders and revenues in other quarters will vary based on the particular timing and type of licenses entered into with large customers 

 

international operations 

 

we have approximately 60 sales offices design centers and research and development facilities located around the world we consider customer sales and support requirements the availability of a skilled workforce and costs and efficiencies among other relative benefits when determining what operations to locate internationally for additional information regarding our international operations see the discussion under the heading “ the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations and other risks to our international operations may seriously harm our financial condition” in item 1a “risk factors” and note 21 to our consolidated financial statements 

 

employees 

 

as of december 30 2006 we employed approximately 5200 individuals with approximately 1900 in sales services marketing support and manufacturing activities approximately 2700 in product research and development and approximately 600 in management administration and finance none of our employees are represented by a labor union and we have experienced no work stoppages we believe that our employee relations are good 

 




 item 1a risk factors 

 

our business faces many risks described below are what we believe to be the material risks that we face if any of the events or circumstances described in the following risks actually occurs our business financial condition or results of operations could suffer 

 

risks related to our business 

 

we are subject to the cyclical nature of the integrated circuit and electronics systems industries and any downturn in these industries may reduce our revenue 

 

purchases of our products and services are dependent upon the commencement of new design projects by ic manufacturers and electronics systems companies the ic and electronics systems industries are cyclical and are characterized by constant and rapid technological change rapid product obsolescence and price erosion evolving standards short product life cycles and wide fluctuations in product supply and demand 

 

the ic and electronics systems industries have experienced significant downturns often connected with or in anticipation of maturing product cycles of both these industries’ and their customers’ products and a decline in general economic conditions these downturns have been characterized by diminished product demand production overcapacity high inventory levels and accelerated erosion of average selling prices any economic downturn in the industries we serve could harm our business operating results or financial condition 

 

our failure to respond quickly to technological developments could make our products uncompetitive and obsolete 

 

the industries in which we compete experience rapid technology developments changes in industry standards changes in customer requirements and frequent new product introductions and improvements currently the industries we serve are experiencing several revolutionary trends 

 

 10 

  

if we are unable to respond quickly and successfully to these developments we may lose our competitive position and our products or technologies may become uncompetitive or obsolete to compete successfully we must develop or acquire new products and improve our existing products and processes on a schedule that keeps pace with technological developments and the requirements for products addressing a broad spectrum of designers and designer expertise in our industries we must also be able to support a range of changing computer software hardware platforms and customer preferences we cannot guarantee that we will be successful in this effort 

 

we have experienced varied operating results and our operating results for any particular fiscal period are affected by the timing of significant orders for our software products fluctuations in customer preferences for license types and the timing of revenue recognition under those license types 

 

we have experienced and may continue to experience varied operating results in particular we have experienced net losses for some past periods and we may experience net losses in future periods various factors affect our operating results and some of them are not within our control our operating results for any period are affected by the timing of significant orders for our software products because a significant number of licenses for our software products are in excess of 50 million 

 

our operating results are also affected by the mix of license types executed in any given period we license software using three different license types subscription term and perpetual product revenue associated with term and perpetual licenses is generally recognized at the beginning of the license period whereas product revenue associated with subscription licenses is recognized over multiple periods during the term of the license revenue may also be deferred under term and perpetual licenses until payments become due and payable from customers with nonlinear payment terms or as cash is collected from customers with lower credit ratings in addition revenue is impacted by the timing of license renewals the extent to which contracts contain flexible payment terms and the mix of license types ie perpetual term or subscription for existing customers which changes could have the effect of accelerating or delaying the recognition of revenue from the timing of recognition under the original contract 

 

we plan operating expense levels primarily based on forecasted revenue levels these expenses and the impact of longterm commitments are relatively fixed in the short term a shortfall in revenue could lead to operating results below expectations because we may not be able to quickly reduce these fixed expenses in response to these shortterm business changes 

 

you should not view our historical results of operations as reliable indicators of our future performance if revenue or operating results fall short of the levels expected by public market analysts or investors the trading price of our common stock could decline dramatically 

 

our future revenue is dependent in part upon our installed customer base continuing to license or buy additional products renew maintenance agreements and purchase additional services 

 

our installed customer base has traditionally generated additional new license service and maintenance revenues in future periods customers may not necessarily license or buy additional products or contract for additional services or maintenance maintenance is generally renewable annually at a customer’s option and there are no mandatory payment obligations or obligations to license additional software if our customers decide not to renew their maintenance agreements or license additional products or contract for additional services or if they reduce the scope of the maintenance agreements our revenue could decrease which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

 

we may not receive significant revenue from our current research and development efforts for several years if at all 

 

internally developing software products integrating acquired software products and integrating intellectual property into existing platforms is expensive and these investments often require a long time to generate returns our strategy involves significant investments in software research and development and related product opportunities we believe that we must continue to dedicate a significant amount of resources to our research and development efforts to maintain our competitive position however we cannot predict that we will receive significant if any revenue from these investments 

 

our failure to attract train motivate and retain key employees may make us less competitive in our industries and therefore harm our results of operations 

 

our business depends on the efforts and abilities of our employees the high cost of training new employees not fully utilizing these employees or losing trained employees to competing employers could reduce our gross margins and harm our business or operating results competition for highly skilled employees can be intense particularly in geographic areas recognized as high technology centers such as the silicon valley area where our principal offices are located and the other locations where we maintain facilities if economic conditions continue to improve and job opportunities in the technology industry become more plentiful we may experience increased employee attrition and increased competition for skilled employees to attract retain and motivate individuals with the requisite expertise we may be required to grant large numbers of stock options or other stockbased incentive awards which may be dilutive to existing stockholders and increase compensation expense we may also be required to pay key employees significant base salaries and cash bonuses which could harm our operating results 

 

in addition the nasdaq marketplace rules require stockholder approval for new equity compensation plans and significant amendments to existing plans including increases in shares available for issuance under such plans and prohibit nasdaq member organizations from giving a proxy to vote on equity compensation plans unless the beneficial owner of the shares has given voting instructions these regulations could make it more difficult for us to grant equity compensation to employees in the future to the extent that these regulations make it more difficult or expensive to grant equity compensation to employees we may incur increased compensation costs or find it difficult to attract retain and motivate employees which could materially and adversely affect our business 

 

we have acquired and expect to acquire other companies and businesses and may not realize the expected benefits of these acquisitions 

 

we have acquired and expect to acquire other companies and businesses in the future while we expect to carefully analyze each potential acquisition before committing to the transaction we may not be able to integrate and manage acquired products and businesses effectively in addition acquisitions involve a number of risks if any of the following events occurs after we acquire another business it could seriously harm our business operating results or financial condition 

 

 12 

  

in a number of our previously completed acquisitions we have agreed to make future payments or earnouts based on the performance of the businesses we acquired the performance goals pursuant to which these future payments may be made generally relate to achievement by the acquired business of certain specified bookings revenue product proliferation product development or employee retention goals during a specified period following completion of the applicable acquisition future acquisitions may involve issuances of stock as full or partial payment of the purchase price for the acquired business grants of incentive stock or options to employees of the acquired businesses which may be dilutive to existing stockholders expenditure of substantial cash resources or the incurrence of material amounts of debt 

 

the specific performance goal levels and amounts and timing of contingent purchase price payments vary with each acquisition in connection with our acquisitions completed prior to december 30 2006 we may be obligated to pay up to an aggregate of 48 million in cash during the next 12 months and an additional 20 million in cash in periods after the next 12 months through august 2008 if certain performance goals related to one or more of the criteria mentioned above are achieved in full 

 

the competition in our industries is substantial and we may not be able to continue to successfully compete in our industries 

 

the eda market and the commercial electronics design and methodology services industries are highly competitive if we fail to compete successfully in these industries it could seriously harm our business operating results or financial condition to compete in these industries we must identify and develop or acquire innovative and costcompetitive eda products integrate them into platforms and market them in a timely manner we must also gain industry acceptance for our design and methodology services and offer better strategic concepts technical solutions prices and response time or a combination of these factors than those of other design companies and the internal design departments of electronics manufacturers we cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully in these industries factors that could affect our ability to succeed include 

 

  

we compete in the eda products market primarily with synopsys inc mentor graphics corporation and magma design automation inc we also compete with numerous smaller eda companies with manufacturers of electronic devices that have developed or have the capability to develop their own eda products and with numerous electronics design and consulting companies manufacturers of electronic devices may be reluctant to 

purchase design and methodology services from independent vendors such as us because they wish to promote their own internal design departments 

 

we may need to change our pricing models to compete successfully 

 

the highly competitive markets in which we compete can put pressure on us to reduce the prices of our products if our competitors offer deep discounts on certain products in an effort to recapture or gain market segment share or to sell other software or hardware products we may then need to lower our prices or offer other favorable terms to compete successfully any such changes would be likely to reduce our profit margins and could adversely affect our operating results any substantial changes to our prices and pricing policies could cause sales and software license revenues to decline or be delayed as our sales force implements and our customers adjust to the new pricing policies some of our competitors may bundle products for promotional purposes or as a longterm pricing strategy or provide guarantees of prices and product implementations these practices could over time significantly constrain the prices that we can charge for our products if we cannot offset price reductions with a corresponding increase in the number of sales or with lower spending then the reduced license revenues resulting from lower prices could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

 

we rely on our proprietary technology as well as software and other intellectual property rights licensed to us by third parties and we cannot assure you that the precautions taken to protect our rights will be adequate or that we will continue to be able to adequately secure such intellectual property rights from third parties 

 

our success depends in part upon our proprietary technology we generally rely on patents copyrights trademarks trade secret laws licenses and restrictive agreements to establish and protect our proprietary rights in technology and products despite precautions we may take to protect our intellectual property third parties have tried in the past and may try in the future to challenge invalidate or circumvent these safeguards the rights granted under our patents or attendant to our other intellectual property may not provide us with any competitive advantages and there is no guarantee that patents will be issued on any of our pending applications and future patents may not be sufficiently broad to protect our technology furthermore the laws of foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights in those countries to the same extent as applicable law protects these rights in the united states many of our products include software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties we may have to seek new or renew existing licenses for such software and other intellectual property in the future our design and methodology services business holds licenses to certain software and other intellectual property owned by third parties including that of our competitors our failure to obtain for our use software or other intellectual property licenses or other intellectual property rights on favorable terms or the need to engage in litigation over these licenses or rights could seriously harm our business operating results or financial condition 

 

we could lose key technology or suffer serious harm to our business because of the infringement of our intellectual property rights by third parties or because of our infringement of the intellectual property rights of third parties 

 

there are numerous patents in the eda industry and new patents are being issued at a rapid rate it is not always practicable to determine in advance whether a product or any of its components infringes the patent rights of others as a result from time to time we may be compelled to respond to or prosecute intellectual property infringement claims to protect our rights or defend a customer’s rights for example on november 8 2006 an individual filed suit against us magma design automation inc dynalith systems inc altera corp mentor graphics corp and aldec inc in the united states district court for the eastern district of texas the suit alleges that certain products of cadence and the other defendants infringe a patent for an electronic simulation and emulation system owned by the plaintiff the plaintiff seeks unspecified damages and attorneys’ fees and costs we dispute the plaintiff’s claims and intend to defend the lawsuit vigorously 

 

intellectual property infringement claims regardless of merit could consume valuable management time result in costly litigation or cause product shipment delays all of which could seriously harm our business operating results or financial condition in settling these claims we may be required to enter into royalty or licensing agreements with the third parties claiming infringement these royalty or licensing agreements if available may not have terms favorable to us being compelled to enter into a license agreement with unfavorable 

terms could seriously harm our business operating results or financial condition any potential intellectual property litigation could compel us to do one or more of the following 

 

  

if we were compelled to take any of these actions our business or results of operations may suffer 

 

if our security measures are breached and an unauthorized party obtains access to customer data our information systems may be perceived as being unsecure and customers may curtail or stop their use of our products and services 

 

our products and services involve the storage and transmission of customers’ proprietary information and breaches of our security measures could expose us to a risk of loss or misuse of this information litigation and potential liability because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage information systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventive measures if an actual or perceived breach of our security occurs the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed and we could lose existing customers and our ability to obtain new customers 

 

we may not be able to effectively implement our restructuring activities and our restructuring activities may not result in the expected benefits which would negatively impact our future results of operations 

 

the eda market and the commercial electronics design and methodology services industries are highly competitive and change quickly we have responded to increased competition and changes in the industries in which we compete in part by restructuring our operations and at times reducing the size of our workforce despite our restructuring efforts in prior years we may not achieve all of the operating expense reductions and improvements in operating margins and cash flows anticipated from those restructuring activities in the periods contemplated our inability to realize these benefits may result in an inefficient business structure that could negatively impact our results of operations 

 

as part of our restructuring activities in prior years we have reduced the workforce in certain revenuegenerating portions of our business these reductions in staffing levels could require us to forego certain future opportunities due to resource limitations which could negatively affect our longterm revenues 

 

we cannot assure you that we will not be required to implement further restructuring activities or reductions in our workforce based on changes in the markets and industries in which we compete or that any future restructuring efforts will be successful 

 

the long sales cycle of our products and services makes the timing of our revenue difficult to predict and may cause our operating results to fluctuate unexpectedly 

 

we have a long sales cycle that generally extends at least three to six months the length of the sales cycle may cause our revenue or operating results to vary from quarter to quarter the complexity and expense associated with our business generally require a lengthy customer education evaluation and approval process consequently we may incur substantial expenses and devote significant management effort and expense to develop potential relationships that do not result in agreements or revenue and may prevent us from pursuing other opportunities 

 

in addition sales of our products and services may be delayed if customers delay approval or commencement of projects because of 

 

  

long sales cycles for acceleration and emulation hardware products subject us to a number of significant risks over which we have limited control including insufficient excess or obsolete inventory variations in inventory valuation and fluctuations in quarterly operating results 

 

also because of the timing of large orders and our customers’ buying patterns we may not learn of bookings shortfalls revenue shortfalls earnings shortfalls or other failures to meet market expectations until late in a fiscal quarter these factors may cause our operating results to fluctuate unexpectedly 

 

the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations and other risks to our international operations may seriously harm our financial condition 

 

we have significant operations outside the united states our revenue from international operations as a percentage of total revenue was approximately 48 in 2006 54 in 2005 and 50 in 2004 we expect that revenue from our international operations will continue to account for a significant portion of our total revenue we also transact business in various foreign currencies recent economic and political uncertainty and the volatility of foreign currencies in certain regions most notably the japanese yen european union euro british pound and indian rupee have had and may in the future have a harmful effect on our revenue or operating results 

 

fluctuations in the rate of exchange between the united states dollar and the currencies of other countries in which we conduct business could seriously harm our business operating results or financial condition for example if there is an increase in the rate at which a foreign currency exchanges into united states dollars it will take more of the foreign currency to equal the same amount of united states dollars than before the rate increase if we price our products and services in the foreign currency we will receive fewer united states dollars than we did before the rate increase went into effect if we price our products and services in united states dollars an increase in the exchange rate will result in an increase in the price for our products and services compared to those products of our competitors that are priced in local currency this could result in our prices being uncompetitive in markets where business is transacted in the local currency 

 

exposure to foreign currency transaction risk can arise when transactions are conducted in a currency different from the functional currency of one of our subsidiaries a subsidiary’s functional currency is generally the currency in which it primarily conducts its operations including product pricing expenses and borrowings although we attempt to reduce the impact of foreign currency fluctuations significant exchange rate movements may hurt our results of operations as expressed in united states dollars 

 

our international operations may also be subject to other risks including 

 

  

we have offices throughout the world including key research and development facilities outside of the united states our operations are dependent upon the connectivity of our operations throughout the world activities that 

interfere with our international connectivity such as computer “hacking” or the introduction of a virus into our computer systems could significantly interfere with our business operations 

 

our operating results could be adversely affected as a result of changes in our effective tax rates 

 

our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by the following 

 

  

any significant change in our future effective tax rates could adversely impact our results of operations for future periods 

 

we have received examination reports from the internal revenue service proposing deficiencies in certain of our tax returns and the outcome of current and future tax examinations may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows 

 

the irs and other tax authorities regularly examine our income tax returns in november 2003 the irs completed its field examination of our federal income tax returns for the tax years 1997 through 1999 and issued a revenue agent’s report or rar in which the irs proposes to assess an aggregate tax deficiency for the threeyear period of approximately 1430 million the most significant of the disputed adjustments for the tax years 1997 through 1999 relates to transfer pricing arrangements that we have with a foreign subsidiary we have filed a protest to certain of the proposed adjustments with the appeals office of the irs where the matter is currently being considered 

 

in july 2006 the irs completed its field examination of our federal income tax returns for the tax years 2000 through 2002 and issued an rar in which the irs proposes to assess an aggregate tax deficiency for the threeyear period of approximately 3240 million in november 2006 the irs revised the proposed aggregate tax deficiency for the threeyear period to be approximately 3180 million the irs is contesting our qualification for deferred recognition of certain proceeds received from restitution and settlement in connection with litigation during the period the proposed tax deficiency for this item is approximately 1520 million the remaining proposed tax deficiency of approximately 1660 million is primarily related to proposed adjustments to our transfer pricing arrangements that we have with foreign subsidiaries and to our deductions for foreign trade income the irs took similar positions with respect to our transfer pricing arrangements in the prior examination period and may make similar claims against our transfer pricing arrangements in future examinations we have filed a timely protest with the irs and will seek resolution of the issues through the appeals office of the irs 

 

we believe that the proposed irs adjustments are inconsistent with applicable tax laws and we are challenging these proposed adjustments vigorously the rars are not final statutory notices of deficiency but the irs imposes interest on the proposed deficiencies until the matters are resolved interest is compounded daily at rates published by the irs which rates are adjusted quarterly and have been between four and ten percent since 1997 

 

significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from tax examinations including the rars for the tax years 1997 through 2002 we provide for tax liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets unless we consider it probable that additional taxes will not be due however the ultimate outcome of tax examinations including the total amount payable or the timing of any such payments upon resolution of these issues cannot be predicted with certainty in addition we cannot assure you that such amount 

will not be materially different than that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals should the irs or other tax authorities assess additional taxes as a result of a current or a future examination we may be required to record charges to operations in future periods that could have a material impact on the results of operations financial position or cash flows in the applicable period or periods 

 

forecasting our estimated annual effective tax rate is complex and subject to uncertainty and material differences between forecasted and actual tax rates could have a material impact on our results of operations 

 

forecasts of our income tax position and resultant effective tax rate are complex and subject to uncertainty because our income tax position for each year combines the effects of a mix of profits and losses earned by us and our subsidiaries in tax jurisdictions with a broad range of income tax rates as well as benefits from available deferred tax assets the impact of various accounting rules and changes to these rules and costs resulting from tax audits to forecast our global tax rate pretax profits and losses by jurisdiction are estimated and tax expense by jurisdiction is calculated if the mix of profits and losses our ability to use tax credits or effective tax rates by jurisdiction is different than those estimates our actual tax rate could be materially different than forecasted which could have a material impact on our results of operations 

 

failure to obtain export licenses could harm our business by rendering us unable to ship products and transfer our technology outside of the united states 

 

we must comply with regulations of the united states department of commerce and of certain other countries in shipping our software products and transferring our technology outside the united states and to foreign nationals although we have not had any significant difficulty complying with such regulations so far any significant future difficulty in complying could harm our business operating results or financial condition 

 

errors or defects in our products and services could expose us to liability and harm our reputation 

 

our customers use our products and services in designing and developing products that involve a high degree of technological complexity each of which has its own specifications because of the complexity of the systems and products with which we work some of our products and designs can be adequately tested only when put to full use in the marketplace as a result our customers or their end users may discover errors or defects in our software or the systems we design or the products or systems incorporating our design and intellectual property may not operate as expected errors or defects could result in 

 

  

if we become subject to unfair hiring claims we could be prevented from hiring needed employees incur liability for damages and incur substantial costs in defending ourselves 

 

companies in our industry whose employees accept positions with competitors frequently claim that these competitors have engaged in unfair hiring practices or that the employment of these persons would involve the disclosure or use of trade secrets these claims could prevent us from hiring employees or cause us to incur liability for damages we could also incur substantial costs in defending ourselves or our employees against these claims regardless of their merits defending ourselves from these claims could also divert the attention of our management away from our operations 

 

our business is subject to the risk of earthquakes floods and other natural catastrophic events 

 

our corporate headquarters including certain of our research and development operations and certain of our distribution facilities is located in the silicon valley area of northern california which is a region known to experience seismic activity in addition several of our facilities including our corporate headquarters certain of our 

research and development operations and certain of our distribution operations are in areas of san jose california that have been identified by the director of the federal emergency management agency or fema as being located in a special flood area the areas at risk are identified as being in a one hundred year flood plain using fema’s flood hazard boundary map or the flood insurance rate map if significant seismic or flooding activity were to occur our operations may be interrupted which would adversely impact our business and results of operations 

 

we maintain research and development and other facilities in parts of the world that are not as politically stable as the united states and as a result we may face a higher risk of business interruption from acts of war or terrorism than businesses located only or primarily in the united states 

 

we maintain international research and development and other facilities some of which are in parts of the world that are not as politically stable as the united states consequently we may face a greater risk of business interruption as a result of terrorist acts or military conflicts than businesses located domestically furthermore this potential harm is exacerbated given that damage to or disruptions at our international research and development facilities could have an adverse effect on our ability to develop new or improve existing products as compared to other businesses which may only have sales offices or other less critical operations abroad we are not insured for losses or interruptions caused by acts of war or terrorism 

 

risks related to our securities and indebtedness 

 

our debt obligations expose us to risks that could adversely affect our business operating results or financial condition and could prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under such indebtedness 

 

we have a substantial level of debt as of december 30 2006 we had 7584 million of outstanding indebtedness as follows 

 

  

the level of our indebtedness among other things could 

 

  

if we experience a decline in revenue due to any of the factors described in this section entitled “risk factors” or otherwise we could have difficulty paying amounts due on our indebtedness in the case of the 2023 notes although they mature in 2023 the holders of the 2023 notes may require us to repurchase for cash all or any portion of the 2023 notes on august 15 2008 for 10025 of the principal amount august 15 2013 for 10000 of the principal amount and august 15 2018 for 10000 of the principal amount as a result although the 2023 notes mature in 2023 the holders may require us to repurchase the 2023 notes at an additional premium in 2008 which makes it probable that we will be required to repurchase the 2023 notes in 2008 if they have not first been repurchased by us or are not otherwise converted 

 

if we are prohibited from paying our outstanding indebtedness we could try to obtain the consent of the lenders under those arrangements to make such payment or we could attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain the restrictions if we do not obtain the necessary consents or refinance the borrowings we may be unable to satisfy our outstanding indebtedness any such failure would constitute an event of default under our indebtedness which could in turn constitute a default under the terms of any other indebtedness then outstanding 

 

if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow or otherwise obtain funds necessary to make required payments or if we fail to comply with the various requirements of our indebtedness we would be in default which would permit the holders of our indebtedness to accelerate the maturity of the indebtedness and could cause defaults under our other indebtedness as well any default under our indebtedness could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition in addition a material default on our indebtedness could suspend our eligibility to register securities using certain registration statement forms under sec guidelines that permit incorporation by reference of substantial information regarding us which could potentially hinder our ability to raise capital through the issuance of our securities and will increase the costs of such registration to us 

 

conversion of the 2023 notes or the convertible senior notes will dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders 

 

the terms of the 2023 notes and the convertible senior notes permit the holders to convert the 2023 notes and the convertible senior notes into shares of our common stock the 2023 notes are convertible into our common stock initially at a conversion price of 1565 per share which would result in an aggregate of approximately 147 million shares of our common stock being issued upon conversion subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events the terms of the convertible senior notes stipulate a net share settlement which upon conversion of the convertible senior notes requires us to pay the principal amount in cash and the conversion premium if any in shares of our common stock based on a daily settlement amount calculated on a proportionate basis for each day of the relevant 20 tradingday observation period the initial conversion rate for the convertible senior notes is 472813 shares of our common stock per 1000 principal amount of convertible senior notes equivalent to a conversion price of approximately 2115 per share of our common stock the conversion price is subject to adjustment in some events but will not be adjusted for accrued interest except in limited circumstances the conversion of some or all of the 2023 notes or the convertible senior notes will dilute the ownership interest of our existing stockholders any sales in the public market of the common stock issuable upon conversion could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock 

 

prior to the conversion of the 2023 notes if the trading price of our common stock exceeds 2269 per share over specified periods basic net income per share will be diluted we may redeem for cash all or any part of the 2023 notes on or after august 15 2008 for 10000 of the principal amount the holders of the 2023 notes may require us to repurchase for cash all or any portion of their 2023 notes on august 15 2008 for 10025 of the principal amount on august 15 2013 for 10000 of the principal amount or on august 15 2018 for 10000 of the principal amount by providing to the paying agent a written repurchase notice the repurchase notice must be delivered during the period commencing 30 business days prior to the relevant repurchase date and ending on the close of business on the business day prior to the relevant repurchase date we may redeem for cash all or any part of the 2023 notes on or after august 15 2008 for 10000 of the principal amount except for those 2023 notes that holders have required us to repurchase on august 15 2008 or on other repurchase dates as described above 

 

each 1000 of principal of the 2023 notes is initially convertible into 63879 shares of our common stock subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events holders of the 2023 notes may convert their 2023 notes prior to maturity only if 

 

  

as a result although the 2023 notes mature in 2023 the holders may require us to repurchase their notes at an additional premium in 2008 which makes it probable that we will be required to repurchase the 2023 notes in 2008 

if they have not first been repurchased by us or are not otherwise converted as of december 30 2006 none of the conditions allowing holders of the 2023 notes to convert had been met 

 

each 1000 of principal of the convertible senior notes is initially convertible into 472813 shares of our common stock subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events holders of the convertible senior notes may convert their notes at their option on any day prior to the close of business on the scheduled trading day immediately preceding december 15 2011 in the case of the 2011 notes and december 15 2013 in the case of the 2013 notes in each case only if 

 

  

on and after november 2 2011 in the case of the 2011 notes and november 1 2013 in the case of 2013 notes until the close of business on the scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date of such convertible senior notes holders may convert their convertible senior notes at any time regardless of the foregoing circumstances as of december 30 2006 none of the conditions allowing holders of the convertible senior notes to convert had been met 

 

although the conversion price of the 2023 notes is currently 1565 per share the hedge and warrant transactions that we entered into in connection with the issuance of the 2023 notes effectively increased the conversion price of the 2023 notes until various dates in 2008 to approximately 2308 per share which would result in an aggregate issuance upon conversion prior to august 15 2008 of approximately 102 million shares of our common stock we entered into hedge and warrant transactions to reduce the potential dilution from the conversion of the 2023 notes however we cannot guarantee that such hedge and warrant instruments will fully mitigate the dilution in addition the existence of the 2023 notes may encourage short selling by market participants because the conversion of the 2023 notes could depress the price of our common stock 

 

although the conversion price of the convertible senior notes is currently 2115 per share we entered into hedge and separate warrant transactions to reduce the potential dilution from the conversion of the convertible senior notes however we cannot guarantee that such hedges and warrant instruments will fully mitigate the dilution in addition the existence of the convertible senior notes may encourage short selling by market participants because the conversion of the convertible senior notes could depress the price of our common stock 

 

at the option of the 2023 noteholders and the convertible senior noteholders under certain circumstances we may be required to repurchase the 2023 notes and the convertible senior notes as the case may be in cash or shares of our common stock 

 

under the terms of the 2023 notes and the convertible senior notes we may be required to repurchase the 2023 notes and the convertible senior notes following a “fundamental change” in our corporate ownership or structure such as a change of control in which substantially all of the consideration does not consist of publicly traded securities prior to maturity of the 2023 notes and the convertible senior notes as the case may be following a fundamental change in certain circumstances we may choose to pay the repurchase price of the 2023 notes in cash shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock if we choose to pay all or any part of the repurchase price of the 2023 notes in shares of our common stock this would result in dilution to the holders of our common stock the repurchase price for the convertible senior notes in the event of a fundamental change must be paid solely in cash these repayment obligations may have the effect of discouraging delaying or preventing a takeover of our company that may otherwise be beneficial to investors 

 

hedge and warrant transactions entered into in connection with the issuance of the convertible senior notes and the 2023 notes may affect the value of our common stock 

 

we entered into hedge transactions with various financial institutions at the time of issuance of the convertible senior notes and the 2023 notes with the objective of reducing the potential dilutive effect of issuing our common stock upon conversion of the convertible senior notes and the 2023 notes we also entered into separate warrant transactions with the same financial institutions in connection with our hedge and warrant transactions these 

financial institutions purchased our common stock in secondary market transactions and entered into various overthecounter derivative transactions with respect to our common stock these entities or their affiliates are likely to modify their hedge positions from time to time prior to conversion or maturity of the convertible senior notes and the 2023 notes by purchasing and selling shares of our common stock other of our securities or other instruments they may wish to use in connection with such hedging any of these transactions and activities could adversely affect the value of our common stock and as a result the number of shares and the value of the common stock holders will receive upon conversion of the convertible senior notes and the 2023 notes in addition subject to movement in the price of our common stock if the hedge transactions settle in our favor we could be exposed to credit risk related to the other party with respect to the payment we are owed from such other party 

 

rating agencies may provide unsolicited ratings on the convertible senior notes that could reduce the market value or liquidity of our common stock 

 

we have not requested a rating of the convertible senior notes from any rating agency and we do not anticipate that the convertible senior notes will be rated however if one or more rating agencies independently elects to rate the convertible senior notes and assigns the convertible senior notes a rating lower than the rating expected by investors or reduces such rating in the future the market price or liquidity of the convertible senior notes and our common stock could be harmed should a decline in the market price of the convertible senior notes result as compared to the price of our common stock this may trigger the right of the holders of the convertible senior notes to convert the convertible senior notes into cash and shares of our common stock 

 

antitakeover defenses in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and certain provisions under delaware law could prevent an acquisition of our company or limit the price that investors might be willing to pay for our common stock 

 

our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and certain provisions of the delaware general corporation law that apply to us could make it difficult for another company to acquire control of our company for example 

 

  

all or any one of these factors could limit the price that certain investors would be willing to pay for shares of our common stock and could delay prevent or allow our board of directors to resist an acquisition of our company even if a proposed transaction were favored by a majority of our independent stockholders

 item 2 properties 

 

our headquarters is located in san jose california and we own the related land and buildings we also own buildings in india as of december 30 2006 the total square footage of our owned buildings was approximately 925000 

 

in january 2007 we completed the sale of certain of our land and buildings in san jose california representing 262500 of our square footage owned as of december 30 2006 concurrently with the sale we leased back from the purchaser all available space in the buildings the lease agreement includes an initial term of two years with two options to extend the lease for six months each 

 

we lease additional facilities for our sales offices in the united states and various foreign countries and for our research and development and design and methodology services facilities worldwide we sublease certain of these facilities where space is not fully utilized or has been involved in restructuring activities 

 

we believe that these facilities and the undeveloped land we own adjacent to our current headquarters are adequate for our current needs and that suitable additional or substitute space will be available as needed to accommodate any expansion of our operations 

 




 item 3 legal proceedings 

 

from time to time we are involved in various disputes and litigation matters that arise in the ordinary course of business these include disputes and lawsuits related to intellectual property mergers and acquisitions licensing contract law distribution arrangements and employee relations matters periodically we review the status of each significant matter and assess its potential financial exposure if the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount or the range of loss can be estimated we accrue a liability for the estimated loss in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards or sfas no 5 “accounting for contingencies” legal proceedings are subject to uncertainties and the outcomes are difficult to predict because of such uncertainties accruals are based only on the best information available at the time as additional information becomes available we reassess the potential liability related to pending claims and litigation matters and may revise estimates 

 

on november 8 2006 an individual filed suit against us magma design automation inc dynalith systems inc altera corp mentor graphics corp and aldec inc in the united states district court for the eastern district of texas the suit alleges that certain products of cadence and the other defendants infringe a patent for an electronic simulation and emulation system owned by the plaintiff the plaintiff seeks unspecified damages and attorneys’ fees and costs we dispute the plaintiff’s claims and intend to defend the lawsuit vigorously 

 

while the outcome of these disputes and litigation matters cannot be predicted with any certainty management does not believe that the outcome of any current matters will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations

we urge you to consider these factors carefully in evaluating the forwardlooking statements contained in this annual report all subsequent written or spoken forwardlooking statements attributable to our company or persons acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by these cautionary statements the forwardlooking statements included in this annual report are made only as of the date of this annual report we do not intend and undertake no obligation to update these forwardlooking statements 

 

overview 

 

we develop electronic design automation or eda software and hardware we license software sell or lease hardware technology provide maintenance for our software and hardware and provide design and methodology services throughout the world to help manage and accelerate electronics product development processes our broad range of products and services are used by the world’s leading electronics companies to design and develop complex integrated circuits or ics and personal and commercial electronics systems 

 

with the addition of emerging nanometer design considerations to the already burgeoning set of traditional design tasks complex soc or ic design can no longer be accomplished using a collection of discrete design tools what previously consisted of sequential design activities must be merged and accomplished nearly simultaneously without timeconsuming data translation steps we combine our design technologies into “platforms” for four major design activities functional verification digital ic design custom ic design and system interconnect the four cadence design platforms are incisive functional verification encounter digital ic design virtuoso custom design and allegro system interconnect platforms in addition we augment these platform product offerings with a comprehensive set of dfm products that service both the digital and custom ic design flows these four platforms together with our dfm products comprise our primary product lines 

 

functional verification was the fastest growing product group of our business in 2006 driven by our incisive verification solutions we offer a complete solution for verification management from planning to closure during 2006 we also introduced a significant upgrade of our virtuoso platform an early adopter program for this platform helped stimulate demand this release is the most significant upgrade to the custom product line in many years finally in late 2006 we introduced the logic design team solution which combines technology from our incisive verification and encounter digital design platforms to create an integrated frontend environment for logic designers 

 

we have identified certain items that management uses as performance indicators to manage our business including revenue certain elements of operating expenses and cash flow from operations and we describe these items more fully below under the heading “results of operations” below 

 

critical accounting estimates 

 

in preparing our consolidated financial statements we make assumptions judgments and estimates that can have a significant impact on our revenue operating income and net income as well as on the value of certain assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets we base our assumptions judgments and estimates on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions at least quarterly we evaluate our assumptions judgments and estimates and make changes accordingly we believe that the assumptions judgments and estimates involved in the accounting for revenue recognition accounting for income taxes restructuring charges and valuation of stockbased awards have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements therefore we consider these to be our critical accounting estimates historically our assumptions judgments and estimates relative to our critical accounting estimates have not differed materially from actual results for further information on our significant accounting policies see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements 

 

revenue recognition 

 

we apply the provisions of statement of position or sop 972 “software revenue recognition” as amended by sop 989 “modification of sop 972 software revenue recognition with respect to certain transactions” to all product revenue transactions where the software is not incidental we also apply the provisions of sfas no 13 “accounting for leases” to all hardware lease transactions we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists the product has been delivered the fee is fixed or determinable collection of the resulting receivable is probable and vendorspecific objective evidence of fair value or vsoe exists 

 

we license software using three different license types 

 

  

subscription licenses  – our subscription license arrangements offer our customers the right to 

 

 29 

  

in general revenue associated with subscription licenses is recognized ratably over the term of the license commencing upon the later of the effective date of the arrangement or delivery of the software product subscription license revenue is allocated to product and maintenance revenue the allocation to maintenance revenue is based on vendor specific objective evidence or vsoe of fair value of the undelivered maintenance that was established in connection with the sale of our term licenses 

 

term licenses  – our term license arrangements offer our customers the right to 

 

  

the right to remix all software products delivered pursuant to the license agreement is not considered an exchange or return of software because all software products have been delivered and the customer has the continuing right to use them in general revenue associated with term licenses is recognized upon the later of the effective date of the arrangement or delivery of the software product 

 

perpetual licenses  – our perpetual licenses consist of software licensed on a perpetual basis with no right to return or exchange the licensed software in general revenue associated with perpetual licenses is recognized upon the later of the effective date of the license or delivery of the licensed product 

 

persuasive evidence of an arrangement  – generally we use a contract signed by the customer as evidence of an arrangement for subscription and term licenses and hardware leases if a contract signed by the customer does not exist we have historically used a purchase order as evidence of an arrangement for perpetual licenses hardware sales maintenance renewals and small fixedprice service projects such as training classes and small methodology service engagements of approximately 10000 or less for all other service engagements we use a signed professional services agreement and a statement of work to evidence an arrangement in cases where both a signed contract and a purchase order exist we consider the signed contract to be the most persuasive evidence of the arrangement sales through our distributors are evidenced by a master agreement governing the relationship together with binding purchase orders from the distributor on a transactionbytransaction basis 

 

product delivery  – software and the corresponding access keys are generally delivered to customers electronically electronic delivery occurs when we provide the customer access to the software occasionally we will deliver the software on a compact disc with standard transfer terms of freeonboard or fob shipping point our software license agreements generally do not contain conditions for acceptance with respect to hardware delivery of an entire system is deemed to occur upon its successful installation for certain hardware products installation is the responsibility of the customer as the system is fully functional at the time of shipment for these products delivery is deemed to be complete when the products are shipped with freight terms of fob shipping point 

 

fee is fixed or determinable  – we assess whether a fee is fixed or determinable at the outset of the arrangement primarily based on the payment terms associated with the transaction we have established a history of collecting under the original contract without providing concessions on payments products or services for our installment contracts that do not include a substantial up front payment we may only determine that a fee is fixed or determinable if the arrangement has payment periods that are equal to or less than the term of the licenses and the 

payments are collected in equal or nearly equal installments when evaluated over the entire term of the arrangement 

 

significant judgment is involved in assessing whether a fee is fixed or determinable we must also make these judgments when assessing whether a contract amendment to a term arrangement primarily in the context of a license extension or renewal constitutes a concession our experience has been that we are able to determine whether a fee is fixed or determinable for term licenses while we do not expect that experience to change if we no longer were to have a history of collecting under the original contract without providing concessions on term licenses revenue from term licenses would be required to be recognized when payments under the installment contract become due and payable such a change could have a material impact on our results of operations 

 

collection is probable  – we assess the probability of collecting from each customer at the outset of the arrangement based on a number of factors including the customer’s payment history and its current creditworthiness we have concluded that collection is not probable for license arrangements executed with customers in certain countries if in our judgment collection of a fee is not probable we defer the revenue until the uncertainty is removed which generally means revenue is recognized upon our receipt of cash payment our experience has been that we are able to estimate whether collection is probable while we do not expect that experience to change if we were to determine that collection is not probable for any license arrangement particularly those with installment payment terms revenue from such license would be recognized generally upon the receipt of cash payment such a change could have a material impact on our results of operations 

 

vendorspecific objective evidence of fair value  – our vsoe for certain product elements of an arrangement is based upon the pricing in comparable transactions when the element is sold separately vsoe for maintenance is generally based upon the customer’s stated annual renewal rates vsoe for services is generally based on the price charged when the services are sold separately for multiple element arrangements vsoe must exist to allocate the total fee among all delivered and undelivered elements of a term or perpetual license arrangement if vsoe does not exist for all elements to support the allocation of the total fee among all delivered and undelivered elements of the arrangement revenue is deferred until such evidence does exist for the undelivered elements or until all elements are delivered whichever is earlier if vsoe of all undelivered elements exists but vsoe does not exist for one or more delivered elements revenue is recognized using the residual method under the residual method the vsoe of the undelivered elements is deferred and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee is recognized as revenue as the elements are delivered our experience has been that we are able to estimate vsoe 

 

finance fee revenue  – finance fees result from discounting to present value the product revenue derived from our installment contracts in which the payment terms extend beyond one year from the effective date of the contract finance fees are recognized using a method that approximates the effective interest method over the relevant license term and are classified as product revenue finance fee revenue represented approximately 2 of total revenue for each of the years ended december 30 2006 december 31 2005 and january 1 2005 upon the sale of an installment contract we recognize the remaining finance fee revenue associated with the installment contract 

 

services revenue  – services revenue consists primarily of revenue received for performing design and methodology services these services are not related to the functionality of the products licensed revenue from service contracts is recognized either on the time and materials method as work is performed or on the percentageofcompletion method for contracts with fixed or nottoexceed fees we estimate on a monthly basis the percentageofcompletion which is based on the completion of milestones relating to the arrangement we have a history of accurately estimating project status and the costs necessary to complete projects a number of internal and external factors can affect our estimates including labor rates utilization and efficiency variances and specification and testing requirement changes if different conditions were to prevail such that accurate estimates could not be made then the use of the completed contract method would be required and the recognition of all revenue and costs would be deferred until the project was completed such a change could have a material impact on our results of operations 

 

accounting for income taxes 

 

we provide for the effect of income taxes in our consolidated financial statements in accordance with sfas no 109 “accounting for income taxes” under sfas no 109 income tax expense benefit is recognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and for deferred tax assets and liabilities for the tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity’s financial statements or tax returns 

 

we must make significant assumptions judgments and estimates to determine our current provision for income taxes our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance to be recorded against our deferred tax assets our judgments assumptions and estimates relating to the current provision for income taxes take into account current tax laws our interpretation of current tax laws and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax authorities changes in tax laws or our interpretation of tax laws and developments in current and future tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our results of operations financial position or cash flows our assumptions judgments and estimates relating to the value of our net deferred tax assets take into account predictions of the amount and category of future taxable income from potential sources including tax planning strategies that would if necessary be implemented to prevent a loss carryforward or tax credit carryforward from expiring unused actual operating results and the underlying amount and category of income in future years could render our current assumptions judgments and estimates of recoverable net deferred taxes inaccurate thus materially affecting our consolidated financial position or results of operations 

 

restructuring charges 

 

we account for restructuring charges in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 100 “restructuring and impairment charges” as amended from fiscal 2001 through fiscal 2005 we undertook significant restructuring initiatives all restructuring activities initiated prior to fiscal 2003 were accounted for in accordance with emerging issues task force or eitf no 943 “liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring” and eitf no 8810 “costs associated with lease modifications or terminations” for restructuring activities initiated after fiscal 2002 we accounted for the leased facilities in accordance with sfas no 146 “accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities” in addition for all periods presented we accounted for the assetrelated portions of these restructurings in accordance with sfas no 144 “accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets” for all periods presented the severance and benefits charges were accounted for in accordance with sfas no 112 “employers’ accounting for postemployment benefits – an amendment of fasb statements no 5 and 43” 

 

these restructuring initiatives have required us to make a number of estimates and assumptions related to losses on excess facilities vacated or consolidated particularly estimating when if at all we will be able to sublet vacated facilities and if we do the sublease terms closure and space reduction costs that are part of our restructuring charges include payments required under leases less any applicable estimated sublease income after the facilities are abandoned lease buyout costs and certain contractual costs to maintain facilities during the abandonment period 

 

we regularly evaluate the adequacy of our restructuring accrual and adjust the balance based on changes in estimates and assumptions we may incur future charges for new restructuring activities as well as changes in estimates to amounts previously recorded 

 

valuation of stockbased awards 

 

we account for stockbased compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 123r “sharebased payment” under sfas no 123r stockbased compensation expense is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period determining the fair value of stockbased awards at the grant date requires judgment including estimating the expected volatility of our stock the expected term of stock options the riskfree interest rate for the period expected dividends and expected forfeitures the computation of the expected volatility assumption used in the blackscholes pricing model for option grants is based on implied volatility calculated using an average of the volatility of publicly traded 

options for our common stock and our 2023 notes we use this approach to determine volatility because options for our common stock are actively traded the market prices of both the traded options and underlying shares are measured at a similar point in time to each other and on a date reasonably close to the grant date of the employee stock options the traded options have exercise prices that are both nearthemoney and close to the exercise price of the employee stock options and the remaining maturities of the traded options on which the estimate is based are at least one year when establishing the expected life assumption we review annual historical employee exercise behavior with respect to option grants having similar vesting periods in addition judgment is also required in estimating the amount of stockbased awards that we expect to be forfeited we calculate a separate expected forfeiture rate for both stock options and restricted stock issuances based on historical trends the valuation of all options and the expected forfeiture rates for options and restricted stock are calculated based on one employee pool as there is no significant difference in exercise behavior between classes of employees if actual results differ significantly from these estimates stockbased compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially affected 

 

results of operations 

 

we primarily generate revenue from licensing our eda software selling or leasing our hardware technology providing maintenance for our software and hardware and providing design and methodology services we principally utilize three license types subscription term and perpetual the different license types provide a customer with different terms of use for our products such as 

 

  

customer decisions regarding these aspects of license transactions determine the license type timing of revenue recognition and potential future business activity for example if a customer chooses a fixed term of use this will result in either a subscription or term license a business implication of this decision is that at the expiration of the license period the customer must decide whether to continue using the technology and therefore renew the license agreement because larger customers generally use products from two or more of our five product groups rarely will a large customer completely terminate its relationship with us at expiration of the license see the discussion under the heading “critical accounting estimates” above for an additional description of license types and timing of revenue recognition 

 

a substantial portion of our revenue is recognized over multiple periods as a result we do not believe that pricing volatility has been a material component of the change in our revenue from period to period 

 

the amount of revenue recognized in future periods will depend on among other things the terms and timing of our contract renewals or additional product sales with existing customers the size of such transactions and sales to new customers 

 

the value and duration of contracts and consequently product revenue recognized is affected by the competitiveness of our products product revenue recognized in any period is also affected by the extent to which customers purchase subscription term or perpetual licenses and the extent to which contracts contain flexible payment terms the timing of revenue recognition is also affected by changes in the extent to which existing contracts contain flexible payment terms and by changes in contractual arrangements eg subscription to term with existing customers 

 

revenue and revenue mix 

 

we analyze our software and hardware businesses by product group combining revenues for both product and maintenance because of their interrelationship we have formulated a design solution strategy that combines our design technologies into “platforms” which are included in the various product groups described below 

 

our product groups are 

 

functional verification products in this group which include the incisive functional verification platform are used to verify that the high level logical specification of an ic design is correct 

 

digital ic design products in this group which include the encounter digital ic design platform are used to accurately convert the highlevel logical specification of a digital ic into a detailed physical blueprint and then detailed design information showing how the ic will be physically implemented this data is used for creation of the photomasks used in chip manufacture 

 

custom ic design our custom design products which include the virtuoso custom design platform are used for ics that must be designed at the transistor level including analog radio frequency memories high performance digital blocks and standard cell libraries detailed design information showing how an ic will be physically implemented is used for creation of the photomasks used in chip manufacture 

 

system interconnect this product group consists of our pcb and ic package design products including the allegro and orcad products the allegro system interconnect platform offering focuses on system interconnect design platform which enables consistent codesign of ics ic packages and pcbs while the orcad line focuses on costeffective entrylevel pcb solutions 

 

design for manufacturing included in this product group are our physical verification and analysis products these products are used to analyze and verify that the physical blueprint of the integrated circuit has been constructed correctly and can be manufactured successfully 

 

revenue by year 

 

the following table shows our revenue for the fiscal years 2006 2005 and 2004 and the percentage change in revenue between years 

 

 

 

2006 compared to 2005 

 

product revenue was higher in 2006 as compared to 2005 primarily because of increased revenue from licenses for functional verification and custom ic design products partially offset by a small decrease in revenue from licenses for design for manufacturing products functional verification was the fastest growing platform in 2006 services revenue increased in 2006 as compared to 2005 due to an increase in utilization and realization rates for our services personnel 

 

2005 compared to 2004 

 

product revenue was higher in 2005 as compared to 2004 primarily because of increased revenue from licenses for digital ic design functional verification and custom ic products services revenue was lower in 2005 as compared to 2004 due to our reduced capacity to satisfy demand for our design services after having implemented certain restructuring activities 

 

revenue by product group 

 

the following table shows the percentage of product and related maintenance revenue contributed by each of our five product groups and services and other in fiscal 2006 2005 and 2004 

 

 

 

as described under the heading “critical accounting estimates” above certain of our licenses allow customers the ability to remix among software products additionally we have licensed a combination of our products to customers with the actual product selection and number of licensed users to be determined at a later date for these arrangements we estimate the allocation of the revenue to product groups based upon the expected usage of our products by these customers the actual usage of our products by these customers may differ and therefore the revenue allocated in the above table may differ 

 

although we believe the methodology of allocating revenue to product groups is reasonable there can be no assurance that such allocated amounts reflect the amounts that would result had the customer individually licensed each specific software solution at the onset of the arrangement however during the term of the arrangement we reevaluate the allocation of revenue based on actual deployment of our products 

 

the decrease in percentage of services and other in 2005 as compared to 2004 is primarily due to 110 million of revenue recognized from the sale of ip in 2004 this sale of ip in 2004 is included in services and other in the preceding table and in product revenue in the accompanying consolidated income statements 

 

revenue by geography 

 

 

 

revenue by geography as a percentage of total revenue 

 

 

the rate of revenue change varies geographically primarily due to differences in the timing and size of term licenses in those regions no single customer accounted for 10 or more of total revenue in 2006 2005 or 2004 

 

changes in foreign currency exchange rates primarily due to fluctuations of the japanese yen in relation to the united states dollar caused our revenue to decrease by 120 million in 2006 as compared to 2005 and to decrease by 57 million in 2005 as compared to 2004 additional information about revenue and other financial information by geography can be found in note 21 to our consolidated financial statements 

 

stockbased compensation expense summary 

 

we adopted sfas no 123r on january 1 2006 which resulted in an increase in stockbased compensation expense of 641 million in 2006 as compared to 2005 stockbased compensation expense is reflected throughout our costs and expenses in fiscal 2006 2005 and 2004 as follows 

 

 

 

cost of revenue 

 

 

 

cost of revenue as a percentage of related revenue 

 

 

 

cost of product includes costs associated with the sale or lease of our hardware and licensing of our software products cost of product primarily includes the cost of employee salary benefits and other employeerelated costs including stockbased compensation expense amortization of acquired intangibles directly related to cadence products the cost of technical documentation and royalties payable to thirdparty vendors cost of product associated with our hardware products also includes materials assembly labor and overhead these additional manufacturing costs make our cost of hardware product higher as a percentage of revenue than our cost of software product 

 

a summary of cost of product in fiscal 2006 2005 and 2004 is as follows 

 

 

2006 compared to 2005 

 

cost of product decreased 129 million in 2006 as compared to 2005 primarily due to 

 

  

cost of product depends primarily upon the extent to which we acquire intangible assets acquire licenses and incorporate thirdparty technology in our products that are licensed or sold in any given period and the actual mix of hardware and software product sales in any given period assuming no changes to our current portfolio of intangibles we expect the amortization of acquired intangibles component of cost of product to continue decreasing as the amortization periods assigned upon the purchase of certain intangibles are completed 

 

cost of services primarily includes employee salary benefits and other employeerelated costs costs to maintain the infrastructure necessary to manage a services organization and provisions for contract losses if any cost of services increased 46 million in 2006 as compared to 2005 primarily due to 

 

  

cost of maintenance includes the cost of customer services such as hotline and onsite support employee salary benefits and other employeerelated costs for certain employees and documentation of maintenance updates cost of maintenance increased 40 million in 2006 as compared to 2005 primarily due to 

 

  

2005 compared to 2004 

 

cost of product decreased 23 million in 2005 as compared to 2004 primarily due to 

 

  

cost of services increased 09 million in 2005 as compared to 2004 primarily due to 

 

  

cost of maintenance increased 67 million in 2005 as compared to 2004 primarily due to 

 

  

operating expenses 

 

 

operating expenses as a percentage of total revenue 

 

 

 

operating expense summary 

 

2006 compared to 2005 

 

overall operating expenses increased 1225 million in 2006 as compared to 2005 primarily due to 

 

  

2005 compared to 2004 

 

operating expenses increased 974 million in 2005 as compared to 2004 primarily due to 

 

  

marketing and sales 

 

2006 compared to 2005 

 

marketing and sales expenses increased 394 million in 2006 as compared to 2005 primarily due to 

 

  

2005 compared to 2004 

 

marketing and sales expenses increased 331 million in 2005 as compared to 2004 primarily due to 

 

 38 

 

research and development 

 

2006 compared to 2005 

 

research and development expenses increased 694 million in 2006 as compared to 2005 primarily due to 

 

  

2005 compared to 2004 

 

research and development expense increased 226 million in 2005 as compared to 2004 primarily due to 

 

  

general and administrative 

 

2006 compared to 2005 

 

general and administrative expenses increased 137 million in 2006 as compared to 2005 primarily due to 

 

  

2005 compared to 2004 

 

general and administrative expense increased 417 million in 2005 as compared to 2004 primarily due to 

 

 39 

 

amortization of acquired intangibles 

 

 

 

assuming no changes to our current portfolio of intangibles we expect the amortization of acquired intangibles to continue decreasing as the amortization periods assigned upon the purchase of certain intangibles are completed 

 

2006 compared to 2005 

 

amortization of acquired intangibles decreased 247 million in 2006 as compared to 2005 amortization of acquired intangible assets from prior year acquisitions decreased 275 million during 2006 due to the full amortization of certain acquired intangibles this decrease was partially offset by 28 million of amortization of intangibles acquired during 2006 

 

2005 compared to 2004 

 

amortization of acquired intangibles decreased 79 million in 2005 as compared to 2004 amortization of acquired intangible assets from prior year acquisitions decreased 210 million during 2005 due to the full amortization of certain acquired intangibles this decrease was partially offset by 131 million of amortization of intangibles acquired during 2005 

 

restructuring and other charges 

 

we initiated a separate plan of restructuring in each year from 2001 through 2005 in an effort to operate more efficiently while improving operating margins and cash flows the restructuring plans initiated each year from 2001 through 2005 or the 2001 restructuring 2002 restructuring 2003 restructuring 2004 restructuring and 2005 restructuring respectively were intended to decrease costs through workforce reductions and facility and resource consolidation in order to improve our cost structure the 2001 and 2002 restructurings primarily related to our design services business and certain other business or infrastructure groups throughout the world the 2003 restructuring 2004 restructuring and 2005 restructuring were targeted at reducing costs throughout the company the 2004 restructuring has been completed and there was no remaining balance accrued for this restructuring as of december 30 2006 

 

in addition we have recorded estimated provisions for termination benefits and outplacement costs longterm asset impairments and other restructuring costs each reporting period we evaluate the adequacy of the lease loss accrual for each plan of restructuring we adjust the lease loss accrual for changes in real estate markets or other factors that may affect estimated costs or sublease income we also consider executed sublease agreements and adjust the lease loss accrual if sublease income under the agreement differs from initial estimates 

 

during 2005 in conjunction with the workforce reduction in our european design services business we completed a saleleaseback transaction involving land and a building in livingston scotland proceeds from the sale were 336 million and the total gain on the sale was 36 million we leased back a portion of the facility for the next two years and another portion for ten years with an option to terminate the ten year lease after five years we deferred the gain on the sale and are recognizing the gain ratably over the maximum lease term of ten years 

 

a summary of restructuring and other charges by plan of restructuring in fiscal years 2006 2005 and 2004 is as follows 

 

 

 

due to the immateriality of the 2003 restructuring 2002 restructuring and 2001 restructuring they have been combined in the above table 

 

frequently asset impairments are based on significant estimates and assumptions particularly regarding remaining useful life and utilization rates we may incur other charges in the future if management determines that the useful life or utilization of certain longlived assets has been reduced 

 

the initial facility closure and space reduction costs included in these restructurings were comprised of payments required under leases less any applicable estimated sublease income after the properties were abandoned lease buyout costs and other contractual charges to estimate the initial lease loss which is the loss after our cost recovery efforts from subleasing all or part of a building management made certain assumptions related to the time period over which the relevant building would remain vacant and sublease terms including sublease rates and contractual common area charges 

 

as of december 30 2006 our accrued estimate of the lease loss related to all restructuring activities initiated since 2001 was 313 million this amount may be adjusted in the future based upon changes in the assumptions used to estimate the lease loss since 2001 we have recorded facilities consolidation charges net of credits of 970 million under the 2001 through 2005 restructurings related to space reductions or facility closures of 49 sites as of december 30 2006 28 of these sites had been vacated and space reductions had occurred at the remaining 21 sites we expect to pay all of the facilitiesrelated restructuring liabilities for all our restructuring plans prior to 2016 

 

because the restructuring charges and related benefits are derived from management’s estimates made during the formulation of the restructurings based on thencurrently available information our restructuring activities may not achieve the benefits anticipated on the timetable or at the level contemplated demand for our products and services and ultimately our future financial performance is difficult to predict with any degree of certainty accordingly additional actions including further restructuring of our operations may be required in the future 

 

our workforce reduction activities related to the 2004 restructuring and the 2005 restructuring were completed prior to december 31 2005 we recorded a credit during the twelve months ended december 30 

2006 to remove the remaining severance and benefits accrual related to the 2005 restructuring the other activity recorded in each of the restructuring plans for the year ended december 30 2006 relates to payment of remaining lease obligations net of sublease payments received and changes in estimate related to lease loss accruals 

 

we expect to incur an additional 10 million to 20 million of future costs in connection with the 2005 restructuring and an additional 30 million to 50 million of future costs in connection with the 2003 restructuring primarily for facilitiesrelated charges which will be expensed as incurred the actual amount of additional costs incurred could vary depending on changes in market conditions and the timing of these restructuring activities 

 

writeoff of acquired inprocess research and development 

 

upon consummation of an acquisition we immediately charge to expense any acquired inprocess research and development that has not yet reached technological feasibility and has no alternative future use the value assigned to acquired inprocess research and development is determined by identifying research projects in areas for which technological feasibility has not been established the values are determined by estimating costs to develop the acquired inprocess research and development into commercially viable products estimating the resulting net cash flows from such projects and discounting the net cash flows back to their present value the discount rates utilized include a factor that reflects the uncertainty surrounding successful development of the acquired inprocess research and development 

 

the following table summarizes our writeoffs of acquired inprocess research and development charges in fiscal 2006 2005 and 2004 

 

 

 

the following table summarizes as of december 30 2006 the status of inprocess research and development acquired in fiscal 2006 2005 and 2004 

 

 

loss on extinguishment of debt 

 

we recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of 408 million during the year ended december 30 2006 which includes a premium paid to repurchase a portion of the 2023 notes of 389 million and a writeoff of the related portion of unamortized deferred costs of issuing the 2023 notes of 19 million 

 

interest expense 

 

 

 

2006 compared to 2005 

 

interest expense increased 69 million in 2006 as compared to 2005 primarily due to the increased interest of 64 million related to the term loan 

 

2005 compared to 2004 

 

interest expense decreased 08 million in 2005 as compared to 2004 primarily due to a decrease of 06 million in imputed interest on acquisitionrelated payments that occur over time 

 

other income expense net 

 

other income expense net for fiscal 2006 2005 and 2004 was as follows 

 

 

 

the increases in interest income in 2006 as compared to 2005 and in 2005 as compared to 2004 were due to increases in our cash and cash equivalents balances as well as higher interest rates applicable to those balances 

 

in january 2006 khimetrics inc a cost method investment held by telos venture partners lp a limited partnership in which we and our 1996 deferred compensation venture investment plan trust were the sole limited partners was sold for consideration of 653 per share of common stock under the purchase agreement 10 of the consideration was held in escrow to pay the cost of resolving any claims that could have been asserted against khimetrics on or before the first anniversary of the acquisition the escrow amount remaining after resolution of such claims was distributed to the former stockholders of khimetrics in january and february 2007 no gain was recorded on amounts held in escrow during 2006 in connection with this sale we received approximately 202 million in cash and recorded a gain of approximately 171 million during the year ended december 30 2006 

in addition our 1996 deferred compensation venture investment plan trust received 29 million in cash and recorded a gain of 25 million during the year ended december 30 2006 

 

provision for income taxes 

 

the provision for income taxes and the effective tax rates in fiscal 2006 2005 and 2004 were as follows 

 

 

 

2006 compared to 2005 

 

our effective tax rate decreased in 2006 as compared to 2005 primarily due to the 301 million of nonrecurring federal state and foreign income taxes incurred upon our 2005 repatriation of 5000 million of certain foreign earnings under the american jobs creation act which increased the 2005 annual effective tax rate by approximately 23 percentage points 

 

2005 compared to 2004 

 

our effective tax rate increased in 2005 as compared to 2004 primarily due to the nonrecurring income taxes related to our 2005 repatriation of certain foreign earnings and an increase in foreign income tax expense from operations in 2005 

 

outlook for 2007 

 

in july 2006 the fasb issued fin no 48 “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes – an interpretation of fasb statement no 109” which prescribes a new recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return fin no 48 also provides guidance on derecognition classification interest and penalties accounting in interim periods disclosure and transition fin no 48 is effective for fiscal year 2007 the cumulative effect of applying fin no 48 will be reported as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings or other appropriate components of equity or net assets on our consolidated balance sheet for fiscal year 2007 we are currently studying the transition effects of adopting fin no 48 and we are not yet able to assess the impact of fin no 48 on our 2007 financial statements and therefore we are not currently able to disclose the expected effect of its adoption nor our outlook for the fiscal 2007 effective tax rate 

 

as of december 30 2006 we had total net deferred tax assets of approximately 1501 million realization of the deferred tax assets will depend on generating sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character prior to the expiration of certain net operating loss capital loss and tax credit carryforwards although realization is not assured we believe it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets will be realized the amount of the net deferred tax assets however could be reduced or increased in the near term if actual facts including the estimate of future taxable income differ from those estimated 

 

the irs and other tax authorities regularly examine our income tax returns in november 2003 the irs completed its field examination of our federal income tax returns for the tax years 1997 through 1999 and issued a revenue agent’s report or rar in which the irs proposes to assess an aggregate tax deficiency for the threeyear period of approximately 1430 million the most significant of the disputed adjustments for the tax years 1997 through 1999 relates to transfer pricing arrangements that we have with a foreign subsidiary we have filed a protest to certain of the proposed adjustments with the appeals office of the irs where the matter is currently being considered 

 

in july 2006 the irs completed its field examination of our federal income tax returns for the tax years 2000 through 2002 and issued an rar in which the irs proposes to assess an aggregate tax deficiency for the threeyear period of approximately 3240 million in november 2006 the irs revised the proposed aggregate tax deficiency 

for the threeyear period to be approximately 3180 million the irs is contesting our qualification for deferred recognition of certain proceeds received from restitution and settlement in connection with litigation during the period the proposed tax deficiency for this item is approximately 1520 million the remaining proposed tax deficiency of approximately 1660 million is primarily related to proposed adjustments to our transfer pricing arrangements that we have with foreign subsidiaries and to our deductions for foreign trade income the irs took similar positions with respect to our transfer pricing arrangements in the prior examination period and may make similar claims against our transfer pricing arrangements in future examinations we have filed a timely protest with the irs and will seek resolution of the issues through the appeals office of the irs 

 

we believe that the proposed irs adjustments are inconsistent with applicable tax laws and we are challenging these proposed adjustments vigorously the rars are not final statutory notices of deficiency but the irs imposes interest on the proposed deficiencies until the matters are resolved interest is compounded daily at rates published by the irs which rates are adjusted quarterly and have been between four and ten percent since 1997 

 

significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from tax examinations including the rars for the tax years 1997 through 2002 we provide for tax liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets unless we consider it probable that additional taxes will not be due however the ultimate outcome of tax examinations including the total amount payable or the timing of any such payments upon resolution of these issues cannot be predicted with certainty in addition we cannot assure you that such amount will not be materially different than that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals should the irs or other tax authorities assess additional taxes as a result of a current or a future examination we may be required to record charges to operations in future periods that could have a material impact on our results of operations financial position or cash flows in the applicable period or periods 

 

disclosures about market risk 

 

interest rate risk 

 

our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our portfolio of cash and cash equivalents while we are exposed to interest rate fluctuations in many of the world’s leading industrialized countries our interest income and expense is most sensitive to fluctuations in the general level of united states interest rates in this regard changes in united states interest rates affect the interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents and costs associated with foreign currency hedges 

 

we invest in high quality credit issuers and by policy limit the amount of our credit exposure to any one issuer as part of our policy our first priority is to reduce the risk of principal loss consequently we seek to preserve our invested funds by limiting default risk market risk and reinvestment risk we mitigate default risk by investing in only high quality credit securities that we believe to have low credit risk and by positioning our portfolio to respond appropriately to a significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor the shortterm interestbearing portfolio of cash and cash equivalents includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity 

 

all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase are considered to be cash equivalents investments with maturities greater than three months are classified as availableforsale and are considered to be shortterm investments the carrying value of our interestbearing instruments approximated fair value as of december 30 2006 the following table presents the carrying value and related weighted average interest rates for our interestbearing instruments which are all classified as cash and cash equivalents on our consolidated balance sheet as of december 30 2006 

 

 

 

foreign currency risk 

 

our operations include transactions in foreign currencies and therefore we benefit from a weaker dollar and we are adversely affected by a stronger dollar relative to major currencies worldwide the primary effect of foreign currency transactions on our results of operations from a weakening united states dollar is an increase in revenue offset by a smaller increase in expenses conversely the primary effect of foreign currency transactions on our results of operations from a strengthening united states dollar is a reduction in revenue offset by a smaller reduction in expenses 

 

we enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts with financial institutions to protect against currency exchange risks associated with existing assets and liabilities a foreign currency forward exchange contract acts as a hedge by increasing in value when underlying assets decrease in value or underlying liabilities increase in value due to changes in foreign exchange rates conversely a foreign currency forward exchange contract decreases in value when underlying assets increase in value or underlying liabilities decrease in value due to changes in foreign exchange rates these forward contracts are not designated as accounting hedges under sfas no 133 “accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities” and therefore the unrealized gains and losses are recognized in other income net in advance of the actual foreign currency cash flows with the fair value of these forward contracts being recorded as accrued liabilities or other assets 

 

our policy governing hedges of foreign currency risk does not allow us to use forward contracts for trading purposes our forward contracts generally have maturities of 90 days or less the effectiveness of our hedging program depends on our ability to estimate future asset and liability exposures we enter into currency forward exchange contracts based on estimated future asset and liability exposures recognized gains and losses with respect to our current hedging activities will ultimately depend on how accurately we are able to match the amount of currency forward exchange contracts with actual underlying asset and liability exposures  

 

the following table provides information as of december 30 2006 about our forward foreign currency contracts the information is provided in united states dollar equivalent amounts the table presents the notional amounts at contract exchange rates and the weighted average contractual foreign currency exchange rates expressed as units of the foreign currency per united states dollar which in some cases may not be the market convention for quoting a particular currency all of these forward contracts matured prior to january 12 2007 

 

 

 

while we actively monitor our foreign currency risks there can be no assurance that our foreign currency hedging activities will substantially offset the impact of fluctuations in currency exchange rates on our results of operations cash flows and financial position 

 

equity price risk 

 

1375 convertible senior notes due 2011 and 1500 convertible senior notes due 2013 

 

in december 2006 we issued 2500 million principal amount of 1375 convertible senior notes due 2011 or the 2011 notes and 2500 million of 1500 convertible senior notes due 2013 or the 2013 notes and collectively the convertible senior notes to three initial purchasers in a private placement pursuant to section 42 of the securities act for resale to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to sec rule 144a concurrently with the issuance of the convertible senior notes we entered into hedge transactions with various parties and in separate transactions sold warrants to various parties to reduce the potential dilution from the conversion of the convertible senior notes and to mitigate any negative effect such conversion may have on the price of our common stock for an additional description of the convertible senior notes including the hedge and warrants transactions see the discussion under the heading “liquidity and capital resources — factors affecting liquidity and capital resources” below 

 

zero coupon zero yield senior convertible notes due 2023 

 

in august 2003 we issued 4200 million principal amount of our 2023 notes to two initial purchasers in a private placement pursuant to section 42 of the securities act for resale to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to sec rule 144a concurrently with the issuance of the 2023 notes we entered into hedge transactions with one of the initial purchasers and in a separate transaction sold warrants to one of the initial purchasers to reduce the potential dilution from the conversion of the 2023 notes and to mitigate any negative effect such conversion may have on the price of our common stock for an additional description of the 2023 notes including the hedge and warrants transactions see the discussion under the heading “liquidity and capital resources — factors affecting liquidity and capital resources” below 

 

investments 

 

we have a portfolio of equity investments that includes marketable equity securities and nonmarketable equity securities our equity investments are made primarily in connection with our strategic investment program 

under our strategic investment program from time to time we make cash investments in companies with technologies that are potentially strategically important to us 

 

the fair value of our portfolio of availableforsale marketable equity securities which are included in shortterm investments on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets was 237 million as of december 30 2006 and 330 million as of december 31 2005 while we actively monitor these investments we do not currently engage in any hedging activities to reduce or eliminate equity price risk with respect to these equity investments accordingly we could lose all or part of our investment portfolio of marketable equity securities if there is an adverse change in the market prices of the companies we invest in 

 

our investments in nonmarketable equity securities would be negatively affected by an adverse change in equity market prices although the impact cannot be directly quantified such a change or any negative change in the financial performance or prospects of the companies whose nonmarketable securities we own would harm the ability of these companies to raise additional capital and the likelihood of our being able to realize any gains or return of our investments through liquidity events such as initial public offerings acquisitions and private sales these types of investments involve a high degree of risk and there can be no assurance that any company we invest in will grow or will be successful or that we will be able to liquidate a particular investment when desired accordingly we could lose all or part of our investment 

 

our investments in nonmarketable equity securities had a carrying amount of 314 million as of december 30 2006 and 379 million as of december 31 2005 if we determine that an otherthantemporary decline in fair value exists for a nonmarketable equity security we write down the investment to its fair value and record the related writedown as an investment loss in our consolidated income statements

cash flows from operating activities 

 

cash flows from operating activities are provided by net income adjusted for certain noncash charges as well as changes in the balance of certain assets and liabilities our cash flows from operating activities are significantly influenced by the payment terms set forth in our license agreements and by sales of our receivables 

 

we have entered into agreements whereby we may transfer accounts receivable to certain financing institutions on a nonrecourse or limitedrecourse basis these transfers are recorded as sales and accounted for in accordance with sfas no 140 “accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities” during 2006 we transferred accounts receivable net of the losses on the sale of the receivables totaling 1806 million which approximated fair value to financing institutions on a nonrecourse basis as compared to 1921 million in 2005 and 301 million in 2004

in january 2006 khimetrics inc a cost method investment held by telos venture partners lp a limited partnership in which we and our 1996 deferred compensation venture investment plan trust were the sole limited partners was sold for consideration of 653 per share of common stock under the purchase agreement 10 of the consideration was held in escrow to pay the cost of resolving any claims that could have been asserted against khimetrics on or before the first anniversary of the acquisition the escrow amount remaining after resolution of such claims was distributed to the former stockholders of khimetrics in january and february 2007 no gain was recorded on amounts held in escrow during 2006 in connection with this sale we received approximately 202 million in cash and recorded a gain of approximately 171 million during the year ended december 30 2006 in addition our 1996 deferred compensation venture investment plan trust received 29 million in cash and recorded a gain of 25 million during the year ended december 30 2006 

 

2006 compared to 2005 

 

net cash used for investing activities decreased by 1109 million in 2006 as compared to 2005 the decrease was primarily due to 

 

  

2005 compared to 2004 

 

net cash used for investing activities increased by 77 million in 2005 as compared to 2004 the increase was primarily due to

cash flows from financing activities 

 

financing cash flows consisted primarily of net proceeds from the issuance of the convertible senior notes in 2006 including payments for the hedge transactions and the proceeds from the separate warrant transactions payments on the term loan in 2006 proceeds received from the term loan in 2005 the repurchase of treasury stock and the issuance of stock under certain employee plans in both 2006 and 2005 

 

2006 compared to 2005 

 

net cash used for financing activities was 2339 million in 2006 as compared to net cash provided by financing activities of 2053 million in 2005 a decrease of 4392 million the decrease was primarily due to 

 

  

2005 compared to 2004 

 

net cash provided by financing activities was 2053 million in 2005 as compared to net cash used for financing activities of 211 million in 2004 an increase of 2264 million the increase of cash provided by financing activities was primarily due to 

 

  

other factors affecting liquidity and capital resources 

 

    income taxes 

 

we provide for united states income taxes on the earnings of foreign subsidiaries unless the earnings are considered permanently invested outside of the united states as of december 30 2006 the cumulative amount of earnings upon which united states income taxes have not been provided was approximately 2740 million as of december 30 2006 the unrecognized deferred tax liability for these earnings was approximately 840 million 

 

the irs and other tax authorities regularly examine our income tax returns in november 2003 the irs completed its field examination of our federal income tax returns for the tax years 1997 through 1999 and issued a revenue agent’s report or rar in which the irs proposes to assess an aggregate tax deficiency for the threeyear period of approximately 1430 million in july 2006 the irs completed its field examination of our federal income tax returns for the tax years 2000 through 2002 and issued an rar in which the irs proposes to assess an aggregate tax deficiency for the threeyear period of approximately 3240 million in november 2006 the irs revised the proposed aggregate tax deficiency for the threeyear period to be approximately 3180 million 

 

we believe that the proposed irs adjustments are inconsistent with applicable tax laws and we are challenging these proposed adjustments vigorously the rars are not final statutory notices of deficiency but the irs imposes 

interest on the proposed deficiencies until the matters are resolved interest is compounded daily at rates published by the irs which rates are adjusted quarterly and have been between four and ten percent since 1997 

 

for an additional description of the irs examinations for the years 1997 through 1999 and 2000 through 2002 see the discussion under the heading “provision for income taxes” above 

 

  term loan 

 

in december 2005 our irish subsidiary castlewilder entered into a syndicated term facility agreement or credit agreement with banc of america securities llc as lead arranger and bank of america na as administrative agent the credit agreement provides for a threeyear 1600 million unsecured term loan or term loan under the terms of the credit agreement castlewilder at its election may prepay the loan in whole or in part with no prepayment fee during the year ended december 30 2006 castlewilder made quarterly principal payments of 320 million plus additional prepayments of 1000 million of the principal amount due under the loan thereby reducing principal payments due under the term loan in 2007 and 2008 as of december 30 2006 scheduled principal payments on the term loan due during 2007 are 280 million 

 

  1375 convertible senior notes due 2011 and 1500 convertible senior notes due 2013 

 

in december 2006 we issued 2500 million principal amount of 1375 convertible senior notes due 2011 or the 2011 notes and 2500 million of 1500 convertible senior notes due 2013 or the 2013 notes and collectively the convertible senior notes to three initial purchasers in a private placement pursuant to section 42 of the securities act for resale to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to sec rule 144a we received net proceeds of approximately 4870 million after transaction fees of approximately 130 million including 120 million of underwriting discounts that were recorded in other longterm assets on the consolidated balance sheet as of december 30 2006 and are being amortized to interest expense over the term of the convertible senior notes a portion of the net proceeds totaling 2285 million was used to purchase 1896 million principal amount of our zero coupon zero yield senior convertible notes due 2023 or the 2023 notes 

 

holders may convert their convertible senior notes prior to maturity upon the occurrence of one of the following events 

 

  

on and after november 2 2011 in the case of the 2011 notes and november 1 2013 in the case of 2013 notes until the close of business on the scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date holders may convert their convertible senior notes at any time regardless of the foregoing circumstances we may not redeem the convertible senior notes prior to maturity 

 

the initial conversion rate for the convertible senior notes is 472813 shares of our common stock per 1000 principal amount of convertible senior notes equivalent to a conversion price of approximately 2115 per share of our common stock upon conversion a holder will receive the sum of the daily settlement amounts calculated on a proportionate basis for each day during a specified observation period following the conversion date the daily settlement amount during each date of the observation period consists of 

 

  

in addition if a fundamental change occurs prior to maturity we will in certain cases increase the conversion rate by an amount up to 827 per share for a holder that elects to convert its convertible senior notes in connection with such fundamental change which amount will be paid entirely in cash a fundamental change is any transaction or event whether by means of an exchange offer liquidation tender offer consolidation merger combination reclassification recapitalization or otherwise in connection with which more than 50 of our common stock is 

exchanged for converted into acquired for or constitutes solely the right to receive consideration which is not at least 90 shares of common stock or depositary receipts representing such shares that are 

 

  

as of december 30 2006 none of the conditions allowing the holders of the convertible senior notes to convert had been met 

 

interest on the convertible senior notes began accruing in december 2006 and is payable semiannually each december 15th and june 15th 

 

concurrently with the issuance of the convertible senior notes we entered into hedge transactions with various parties whereby we have the option to purchase up to 236 million shares of our common stock at a price of 2115 per share subject to adjustment these options expire on december 15 2011 in the case of the 2011 notes and december 15 2013 in the case of the 2013 notes and must be settled in net shares the aggregate cost of these hedge transactions was 1198 million and has been recorded as a reduction to stockholders’ equity in accordance with eitf no 0019 “accounting for derivative financial instruments indexed to and potentially settled in a company’s own stock” the estimated fair value of the hedges acquired in connection with the issuance of the convertible senior notes was 1183 million as of december 30 2006 subsequent changes in the fair value of these hedges will not be recognized as long as the instruments remain classified as equity

    zero coupon zero yield senior convertible notes due 2023 

 

in august 2003 we issued 4200 million principal amount of our 2023 notes to two initial purchasers in a private placement pursuant to section 42 of the securities act for resale to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to sec rule 144a we received net proceeds of 4064 million after transaction fees of 136 million that were recorded in other longterm assets and are being amortized to interest expense using the straightline method over five years which is the duration of the first redemption period the 2023 notes were issued by us at par and bear no interest the 2023 notes are convertible into our common stock initially at a conversion price of 1565 per share which would result in an aggregate of 268 million shares issued upon conversion subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events in connection with the issuance of the convertible senior notes in december 2006 we repurchased 1896 million principal amount of the 2023 notes reducing the aggregate number of shares to be issued upon conversion to 147 million 

 

we may redeem for cash all or any part of the 2023 notes on or after august 15 2008 for 10000 of the principal amount the holders of the 2023 notes may require us to repurchase for cash all or any portion of their 2023 notes on august 15 2008 for 10025 of the principal amount on august 15 2013 for 10000 of the principal amount or on august 15 2018 for 10000 of the principal amount by providing to the paying agent a written repurchase notice the repurchase notice must be delivered during the period commencing 30 business days prior to the relevant repurchase date and ending on the close of business on the business day prior to the relevant repurchase date in addition we may redeem for cash all or any part of the 2023 notes on or after august 15 2008 

for 10000 of the principal amount except for those 2023 notes that holders have required us to repurchase on august 15 2008 or on other repurchase dates as described above 

 

each 1000 of principal of the 2023 notes will initially be convertible into 638790 shares of our common stock subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events holders of the 2023 notes may convert their 2023 notes prior to maturity only if 

 

  

in the event of a fundamental change in our corporate ownership or structure the holders may require us to repurchase all or any portion of their 2023 notes for 10000 of the principal amount upon a fundamental change in our corporate ownership or structure in certain circumstances we may choose to pay the repurchase price in cash shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock as of december 30 2006 none of the conditions allowing the holders of the 2023 notes to convert had been met 

 

in connection with the issuance of the convertible senior notes in december 2006 a portion of the proceeds were used to purchase in the open market 2023 notes with a principal balance of 1896 million for a total purchase price of 2285 million in connection with this purchase we incurred expenses of 408 million for the early extinguishment of debt the loss on early extinguishment of debt included the call premium on the purchased 2023 notes and the writeoff of a portion of the unamortized deferred debt issuance costs

  saleleaseback agreement 

 

in january 2007 we completed the sale of certain land and buildings in san jose california for a sale price of 465 million concurrently with the sale we leased back from the purchaser approximately 262500 square feet of office space which represents all available space in the buildings the lease agreement includes an initial term of two years with two options to extend the lease for six months each we have committed to lease payments related to this lease of 22 million in 2007 24 million in 2008 and 02 million in 2009 

 

we received cash payment for the full sale price in january 2007 during the lease term we intend to construct an additional building located on our san jose california campus to replace the buildings we sold in this transaction we expect to use approximately 220 million in cash during 2007 to begin construction on this new building 

 

contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements 

 

a summary of our contractual obligations as of december 30 2006 is as follows 

 

 

 

as of december 30 2006 the primary component of other longterm contractual obligations of 2789 million related to income tax and acquisition related liabilities 

 

we expect that current cash and shortterm investment balances and cash flows that are generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital and other capital requirements for at least the next 12 months 

 

as of december 30 2006 we did not have any significant offbalance sheet arrangements as defined in item 303a4ii of sec regulation sk 

 

new accounting standards 

 

in july 2006 the fasb issued fin no 48 “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes — an interpretation of fasb statement no 109” which prescribes a new recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return fin no 48 also provides guidance on derecognition classification interest and penalties accounting in interim periods disclosure and transition fin no 48 amends sfas no 5 “accounting for contingencies” to eliminate its applicability to income taxes fin no 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2006 the cumulative effect of applying fin no 48 will be reported as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings or other appropriate components of equity or net assets on our consolidated balance sheet for fiscal 2007 we are currently studying the transition effects of adopting fin no 48 and we are not yet able to assess the impact of fin no 48 on our financial statements and therefore we are currently not able to disclose the expected effect of adoption 

 

in september 2006 the sec issued staff accounting bulletin or sab no 108 “considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements” which provides interpretive guidance on how the effects of the carryover or reversal of prior year misstatements should be considered in quantifying a current year misstatement sab no 108 is effective for us for the year ended december 30 2006 the implementation of sab no 108 did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 

 

in september 2006 the fasb issued sfas no 157 “fair value measurements” which defines fair value establishes guidelines for measuring fair value and expands disclosures regarding fair value measurements sfas no 157 does not require any new fair value measurements but rather eliminates inconsistencies in guidance found in various prior accounting pronouncements sfas no 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after november 15 2007 earlier adoption is permitted provided the company has not yet issued financial statements including for interim periods for that fiscal year we are currently evaluating the impact of sfas no 157 but do 

not expect the adoption of sfas no 157 to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows

 item 9a controls and procedures 

 

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

 

we carried out an evaluation required by rule 13a15 of the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended or the exchange act under the supervision and with the participation of our management including the chief executive officer or ceo and the chief financial officer or cfo of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rules 13a15e and 15d15e under the exchange act as of december 30 2006 

 

the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures included a review of our processes and implementation and the effect on the information generated for use in this annual report on form 10k in the course of this evaluation we sought to identify any significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in our disclosure controls and procedures to determine whether we had identified any acts of fraud involving personnel who have a significant role in our disclosure controls and procedures and to confirm that any necessary corrective action including process improvements was taken this type of evaluation is done every fiscal quarter so that our conclusions concerning the effectiveness of these controls can be reported in our periodic reports filed with the sec the overall goals of these evaluation activities are to monitor our disclosure controls and procedures and to make modifications as necessary we intend to maintain these disclosure controls and procedures modifying them as circumstances warrant 

 

based on their evaluation as of december 30 2006 our ceo and cfo have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by us in our reports filed or submitted under the exchange act i is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the sec’s rules and forms and ii is accumulated and communicated to our management including the ceo and cfo as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure 

 

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

 

there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended december 30 2006 that materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting 

 

inherent limitations on effectiveness of controls 

 

our management including our ceo and cfo does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all error and all fraud a control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within cadence have been detected 

 

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rule 13a15f under the exchange act our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 30 2006 in making this assessment our management used the criteria established in internal controlintegrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission our management has concluded that as of december 30 2006 our internal control over financial reporting is effective based on these criteria our independent registered public accounting firm kpmg llp has issued an audit report on our assessment of our internal control over financial reporting which is included herein

factors driving the electronic design automation industry 

  during the last decade the worldwide communications business productivity and consumer electronics markets accounted for much of the growth in the electronics industry everdecreasing silicon manufacturing process geometries coupled with the move to 300 millimeter wafer production are causing ic unit cost decreases volume increases and greater complexity for providers of electronics devices at the same time the development of ics with greater functionality complicates effective integration of components into complete electronic systems these market and technology forces pose major challenges for the global electronics design community and consequently create significant opportunities and challenges for eda product and service providers 

  from a design perspective many of today’s complex ics are systemon achip or soc devices soc design requires the implementation of an entire electronics subsystem on a single ic which is made possible by smaller feature sizes characteristic of the newest ic fabrication processes smaller feature sizes make it 

1 possible to put additional circuitry on a single segment of silicon or die socs typically include one or more processors microprocessors and digital signal processors a highperformance “bus” for onchip data communication numerous memory devices and peripherals custom digital circuitry custom analog circuitry and millions of lines of software code developed to run on the resulting device these complex devices offer benefits in terms of price performance power and size however they are extremely difficult to design successful soc design requires the convergence of the previously distinct domains of embedded software digital logic analog circuitry ic packaging and pcb design this convergence is changing the way designs for these devices are created 

  the migration to nanometer design poses major challenges for design teams nanometer design refers to the design of ics that have feature sizes smaller than 180 nanometers or one hundred eighty billionths of a meter for reference the diameter of the period at the end of this sentence is approximately 400000 nanometers ic feature sizes for wires transistors and contacts decrease with each advance in the semiconductor manufacturing process each move to a smaller feature size eg decreasing from 130 nanometers to 90 nanometers and smaller requires introducing new capabilities throughout the entire design and manufacturing chain to account for physical effects that were inconsequential at larger geometries but now limit device yield performance reliability and the ability to function as intended for example at 130 nanometers signal integrity issues such as crosstalk between signal wires and voltage drop on power wires become critical at 90 nanometers device power leakage becomes a major factor in total power consumption the increased complexity electrical “noise” and power consumption due to leakage combine to increase the challenge to design teams in meeting chip performance specifications 

  these trends pose significant new challenges for electronics design teams specifically nanometer design requires designers to take into account many physical effects that were too small to affect the performance of larger circuit geometries soc design requires new approaches to managing complexity and its related risks the electronics industry addresses these challenges in a number of ways including the use of new eda products the upgrade of existing tools and design methodologies and offering the advantages of highly integrated frontto back design solutions 

operating segments 

  our chief operating decision maker is our president and chief executive officer or ceo our ceo reviews our consolidated results within only one segment 

products 

  our products are engineered to improve our customers’ design productivity and resulting design quality by providing a comprehensive set of eda design technology product revenues include all fees earned from granting licenses to use our software and from sales and leases of our hardware products and exclude revenues derived from our maintenance and services businesses we offer customers three license types for our software perpetual term and subscription see “software licensing arrangements” below for additional discussion of our license types 

  product revenue was 8515 million or 64 of our total revenue in 2005 7298 million or 61 of our total revenue in 2004 and 6635 million or 59 of our total revenue in 2003 

product strategy 

  with the addition of emerging nanometer design considerations to the already burgeoning set of traditional design tasks complex soc or ic design can no longer be accomplished using a collection of discrete design tools what previously consisted of sequential design activities must be merged and accomplished nearly simultaneously without timeconsuming data translation steps we combine our design technologies into “platforms” for four major design activities functional verification digital ic design custom ic design and system interconnect the four cadence ® design platforms are incisive tm functional verification encounter tm digital ic design virtuoso ® custom design and allegro ® system interconnect platforms in addition we augment these platform product offerings with a comprehensive set of design for manufacturing 

2 products that service both the digital and custom ic design flows these four platforms together with our design for manufacturing products comprise our primary product lines 

incisive functional verification platform 

  the incisive functional verification platform enables our customers to employ enterpriselevel verification process automation including verification planning management and process tracking with coordination of all verification activities across teams of specialists and different execution platforms 

  the incisive platform is tailored for three segments hardware description language engineers design teams who are also responsible for verification and multispecialist enterprise teams the incisive platform includes verification tools and technologies from mixedlanguage and mixedsignal simulation through the specman elite ® test bench solution formal analysis and the palladium ® and extreme ® series of emulation and acceleration solutions the incisive planto closure methodology including technical field experts is designed to enable the scalable deployment of best practices and to mitigate our customers’ language technology and methodology adoption risks the technology acquired in our acquisition of verisity ltd or verisity is included in the incisive platform 

encounter digital ic design platform 

  the encounter digital ic design platform enables our customers to implement all aspects of their digital nanometerscale designs it is based on a single user interface and unified inmemory data model and was specifically designed to facilitate the analysis and optimization of physical interconnect throughout our customers’ design processes the encounter platform is comprised of the following core technologies 

   unlike traditional “frontendbackend” systems the encounter platform does not require customers to perform timeconsuming translations between common tasks such as placement power distribution routing and timingcrosstalk analysis the encounter platform supports hierarchical designs with fullchip support for designs containing more than 50 million gates a gate is an electronic switch that allows or prevents the flow of electrical current in a circuit since 2005 the encounter platform has been comprised of three levels encounter l xl and gxl these levels are scaled to provide customers with technologies tailored to specific degrees of design complexity in the digital ic space 

virtuoso custom design platform 

  the virtuoso custom design platform enables design predictability by ensuring that the circuit design representation will perform correctly in the final manufactured chip with the virtuoso platform designers are able to deliver siliconaccurate analog custom digital radio frequency or rf and mixedsignal designs while addressing the growing number of physical effects in package power grid interconnect devices and substrate employing a “topdown” languagebased design 

  the virtuoso platform reduces design time by providing 

 3  allegro system interconnect design platform 

  the allegro system interconnect design platform enables design teams to design highperformance interconnect across the domains of ic package and pcb reducing cost and time to market the system interconnect — between inputoutput or i o buffers and across ics packages and pcbs — can be optimized through the platform’s codesign methodology reducing both hardware costs and design cycles designers use the allegro platform’s constraintdriven methodology and advanced capabilities for design capture signal integrity and physical implementation silicon designin kits speed time to market by allowing ic companies to shorten new device adoption time and allowing systems companies to accelerate pcb system design cycles 

  the system interconnect product group includes the allegro system interconnect platform and the orcad ® product line of pcb design products which are engineered for individual or small design team productivity the orcad product line is marketed worldwide through a network of alternative channel partners 

design for manufacturing 

  the physical layout of each ic requires detailed analysis and optimization to ensure that the design can be manufactured in volume while performing as expected some of the cadence products that deliver design for manufacturing or dfm capabilities for nanometer soc design include 

 kits 

  today’s growing silicon complexity creates an array of design challenges for semiconductor and systems design teams among these is the application of eda technologies to overcome design hurdles in the wired networking wireless and personal entertainment sectors cadence kits are designed to allow companies in these sectors to achieve shorter more predictable design cycles and greater design productivity by greatly simplifying the application and integration of eda technologies and verification ip 

  each kit addresses applicationspecific design issues by combining a verified methodology packaged in platform flows and enabling standardsbased ip — all applied to a segment representative design and delivered with applicability training we introduced the first kits the ams methodology kit and the arm tm methodology kit in september 2005 and our rf design methodology kit in december 2005 

4 verification and application specific programming services 

  we offer verification and applications specific programming or asp services through timeto market engineering or ttme services our ttme team provides customers with consulting services project services andor complete turnkey services for verification acceleration and system emulation quickcycles allows customers to access our palladium simulation acceleration and emulation products on a payasyougo basis either on the customer internet site or remotely over a highspeed secure network connection 

third party programs and initiatives 

  we recognize that certain of our customers may also use internallydeveloped design tools or design tools provided by other eda companies as well as ip available from multiple suppliers we support the integration of third party design products through our openaccess initiative and connections ® and openchoice programs openaccess is a fullfeatured eda database that supports access and manipulation of its internal eda data via a fully documented and freely available programming interface this provides an open application program interface through which applications developed by our customers by their other eda vendors or by university research groups can all operate within a single database and with cadence platforms we have licensed the openaccess database to the openaccess coalition which is operated by the silicon integration initiative an organization of eda electronic system and semiconductor industry leaders focused on improving productivity and reducing cost in creating and producing integrated silicon systems 

  the connections program provides other eda companies with access to our products to ensure that our products work well with those third party tools over 130 eda providers are members of the connections program the openchoice program was instituted to enable interoperability and facilitate open collaboration with leading providers of library processor memory core and verification ip to build validate and deliver accurate models optimized for cadence design and verification solutions the program aims to ensure ip quality and provide our customers with access to optimized ip a key component of the openchoice program is to assist and support library providers in the integration of our design and verification products and model formats into customerowned tooling or cot library solutions 

  in addition we work with vendors of application specific integrated circuits or asics to ensure predictable and smooth handoff of design data from mutual customers to asic implementation these programs foster relationships throughout the silicon design chain with leading ip partners silicon manufacturers and library provider partners to support both asic and cot solutions for our customers they are integral to providing complete design chain solutions to ic and electronic systems designers who depend on coordinated offerings from multiple suppliers 

maintenance 

  we provide technical support to our customers to facilitate their use of our software and hardware products a high level of customer service and support is critical to the adoption and successful use of our products 

  we have a global customer support organization and specialized field application engineering teams located in each of our operating regions to provide assistance to customers where and when they need it 

  standard maintenance support includes three major components our sourcelink ® online support portal which provides 24 hour access to realtime technical information on our products contact center support telephone email and web access to our support engineers and software updates periodic updates with regressiontested critical fixes and updated functionality available via cds or secure internet download 

  maintenance is offered to customers as an integral noncancelable component of our subscription license agreements or as a separate agreement subject to annual renewal for our term and perpetual license customers 

  some of our customers have relocated or expanded the presence of their design teams away from their headquarters or historical locations to less expensive locations in emerging growth regions accordingly to 

5 provide responsive and effective support for our customers we expect to continue expanding the presence of our own support and application engineering teams in these emerging growth regions 

  maintenance revenue was 3515 million or 26 of our total revenue in 2005 3307 million or 28 of our total revenue in 2004 and 3248 million or 29 of our total revenue in 2003 maintenance revenue in 2006 will be generated predominantly from backlog 

services 

  we offer a number of feebased services including education and engineering services related to ic design and methodology these services may be sold separately or sold and performed in conjunction with the sale lease or license of our products 

  services revenue was 1262 million or 9 of our total revenue in 2005 1370 million or 11 of our total revenue in 2004 and 1311 million or 12 of our total revenue in 2003 

education services 

  our education services include internet classroom and custom courses the content of which ranges from how to use the most recent features of our eda products to instruction in the latest ic design techniques 

engineering services 

  we offer engineering services and reusable design technologies to aid customers with the design of complex ics we focus our offerings primarily on soc devices including both asics and application specific standard parts and on analog and mixed signal ics the customers for these services primarily consist of semiconductor and systems companies developing products for the communications computing and consumer market segments we offer engineering capabilities to assist customers from product concept through volume manufacturing 

  we also make our design ip portfolio available to customers as part of our technology and services solutions these reusable design and methodology components enable us to more efficiently deliver our services and allow our customers to reduce the design complexity and time to market for the development of complex socs 

  in our design and methodology service practices we leverage our cumulative experience and knowledge of design practices across many customers and different design environments to improve our own service teams’ and our customers’ productivity we work with customers using outsourcing consultative and collaborative models depending on their projects and needs our virtual computeraided design or vcad model enables our engineering teams at one or more of our locations to virtually work “sidebyside” with our customers’ teams located elsewhere during the course of their design and engineering projects through a secure private network infrastructure 

  through collaboration with our customers we are able to design advanced ics and gain direct and early visibility to industry design issues that may not be addressed adequately by today’s eda solutions this enables us to accelerate the development of new software technology and products to meet the market’s current and future design requirements 

marketing and sales 

  we generally use a direct sales force consisting of sales people and applications engineers to market our products and provide maintenance and services to existing and prospective customers applications engineers provide technical presales and postsales support for software products due to the complexity of many of our eda products and the electronic design process in general the sales cycle is generally long requiring three to six months or more during the sales cycle our direct sales force generally provides technical presentations product demonstrations and support for onsite customer evaluation of our software 

6   we also use traditional marketing approaches to promote our products and services including advertising direct mail telemarketing trade shows public relations and the internet as eda products mature and become widely understood by the marketplace we selectively utilize value added resellers to broaden our reach and reduce cost of sales the orcad and some incisive products are primarily marketed through these channels 

  internationally we market and support our products and services primarily through our subsidiaries until june 28 2003 we licensed most of our software products in japan through innotech corporation or innotech in june 2003 we purchased certain assets from innotech including distribution rights for certain customers in japan since june 2003 we directly license our software products to customers for which we acquired the distribution rights from innotech as of december 31 2005 we were an approximately 7 stockholder of innotech 

software licensing arrangements 

  we sell software using three license types subscription term and perpetual customers who prefer to license technology for a specified limited period of time will choose either a subscription or term license and customers who prefer to have the right to use the technology continuously without time restriction will choose a perpetual license customers who desire rights to remix in new technology during the life of the contract will select a subscription license which allows them limited access to unspecified new technology on a whenandifavailable basis as opposed to a term or perpetual license which does not include remix rights to new technology payment terms for subscription and term licenses generally provide for payments to be made in installments over the license period and payment terms for perpetual licenses generally are net 30 days 

  our revenue recognition depends on a number of contractspecific terms and conditions including the license type payment terms creditworthiness of the customer and other factors as more fully described under the heading “critical accounting estimates” under item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” revenue associated with subscription licenses is recognized over multiple periods during the license term whereas product revenue associated with term and perpetual licenses is generally recognized upon the later of the effective date or delivery of the product assuming all other criteria for revenue recognition have been met although it can vary from quarter to quarter approximately twothirds of our product revenue was recognized from backlog during each of the past three years 

  our revenue and results of operations may miss expectations due to a shortfall in product revenue generated from current transactions or variance in the actual mix of license types executed in any given period and due to other contractspecific terms and conditions as discussed above we are subject to greater credit risk on subscription and term licenses as compared to perpetual licenses due to the installment payment terms generally associated with those license types otherwise the particular risks to us of one license type versus another type do not vary considerably 

  from time to time we sell receivables from our licenses with installment payment terms on a nonrecourse or limitedrecourse basis to third party financing institutions 

  for further discussion of our license agreements revenue recognition policies and results of operations please refer to “critical accounting estimates” under item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” 

research and development 

  our investment in research and development was 3701 million in 2005 3513 million in 2004 and 3401 million in 2003 

  the primary areas of our research include soc design the design of silicon devices in the nanometer range highperformance ic packaging systemin package and pcb design systemlevel modeling and verification highperformance logic verification technology and hardware software coverification because the electronics industry combines rapid innovation with rapidly increasing design and manufacturing 

7 complexity we make significant investments in enhancing our current products as well as creating new products and technologies and integrating those products and technologies together into segmented solutions 

  our future performance depends largely on our ability to maintain and enhance our current product development and commercialization to meet advancing semiconductor manufacturing capability and design complexity develop acquire or interface to new products from third parties and develop solutions that meet increasingly demanding productivity quality predictability and cost requirements in addition to research and development we maintain cadence laboratories an advanced research group responsible for exploring specific new technologies moving those technologies into product development and maintaining strong industry relationships 

manufacturing and distribution 

  our software production consists of configuring the customer’s order outsourcing the recording of the product electronically or on cdrom and producing customerunique access keys that allow customers to use licensed products software and documentation are primarily distributed to customers by secure electronic delivery user manuals and other documentation are generally available by secure electronic delivery or on cdrom but are occasionally supplied in hard copy format 

  cadence performs final assembly and test of its hardware verification acceleration and emulation products in san jose california subcontractors manufacture all major subassemblies including all individual printed circuit boards and custom ics and supply them to us for qualification and testing prior to their incorporation into the assembled product 

proprietary technology 

  our success depends in part upon our proprietary technology we generally rely on patents copyrights trademarks trade secret laws licenses and restrictive agreements to establish and protect our proprietary rights in technology and products many of our products include software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties we may have to seek new licenses or renew existing licenses for this third party software and other intellectual property in the future as part of performing design and methodology services for customers our design and methodology services business licenses certain software and other intellectual property of third parties including that of our competitors 

competition 

  we compete in the eda market for products and maintenance primarily with three other significant companies synopsys inc mentor graphics corporation and magma design automation inc we also compete with numerous smaller eda companies with manufacturers of electronic devices that have developed or have the capability to develop their own eda products and with numerous electronics design and consulting companies we generally compete on the basis of product quality and features integration in a platform or compatibility with other tools price and payment terms and maintenance offerings 

  our maintenance business flows directly from our products business the competitive issues associated with our maintenance business are substantially the same as those for our products business in that every maintenance contract is the direct result of a product contract and once we have entered into a product contract maintenance is generally purchased by the customer to ensure that the customer will receive access to bug fixes and service releases as and when they are made available and other continued support 

  certain competitive factors in the design and methodology services business as described herein differ from those of the products and maintenance businesses while we also compete with other eda companies in the design and methodology services business we compete more with independent design and methodology service businesses these companies vary greatly in focus geographic location capability cost structure and pricing in addition manufacturers of electronic devices may be reluctant to purchase services from independent vendors such as cadence because they wish to promote their own internal design departments we compete with these companies by focusing on the design of complex analog and digital ics it is our 

8 strategy to use design and methodology services as a differentiator to further promote our products and maintenance businesses 

backlog 

  our backlog on december 31 2005 was approximately 18 billion as compared to 17 billion on january 1 2005 backlog consists of revenue to be recognized over multiple fiscal periods after december 31 2005 from 

   the substantial majority of our backlog is generated by our product and maintenance businesses because customer licenses generally include both product and maintenance components we expect that maintenance revenue in 2006 will be predominately generated from backlog historically we have not experienced significant cancellations of our contracts with customers however we often reschedule the required completion dates of design and methodology services contracts which at times defers revenue recognition under those contracts beyond the original expected completion date changes in customer license types or payment terms also can impact the timing of revenue recognition 

revenue seasonality 

  historically orders and revenue have been lowest in our first quarter and highest in our fourth quarter with a material decline between the fourth quarter of one year and the first quarter of the next year we expect the first quarter will remain our lowest quarter for orders and revenues orders and revenues in other quarters will vary based on the particular timing and type of licenses entered into with large customers 

international operations 

  we have approximately 60 design centers research facilities and sales offices located around the world we consider customer sales and support requirements the availability of a skilled workforce and costs and efficiencies among other relative benefits when determining what operations to locate internationally for additional information regarding our international operations see “the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations and other risks to our international operations may seriously harm our financial condition” in item 1a “risk factors” and note 21 to our consolidated financial statements 

employees 

  as of december 31 2005 we employed approximately 5000 individuals with approximately 2200 in sales services marketing support and manufacturing activities approximately 2300 in product development and approximately 500 in management administration and finance none of our employees are represented by a labor union and we have experienced no work stoppages we believe that our employee relations are good 




 item 1a risk factors 

  our business faces many risks described below are what we believe to be the material risks that we face if any of the events or circumstances described in the following risks actually occurs our business financial condition or results of operations could suffer 

risks related to our business 

we are subject to the cyclical nature of the integrated circuit and electronics systems industries and any downturn in these industries may reduce our revenue 

  purchases of our products and services are dependent upon the commencement of new design projects by ic manufacturers and electronics systems companies the ic and electronics systems industries are cyclical and are characterized by constant and rapid technological change rapid product obsolescence and price erosion evolving standards short product life cycles and wide fluctuations in product supply and demand 

  the ic and electronics systems industries have experienced significant downturns often connected with or in anticipation of maturing product cycles of both these industries’ and their customers’ products and a decline in general economic conditions these downturns have been characterized by diminished product demand production overcapacity high inventory levels and accelerated erosion of average selling prices 

  over the past several years ic manufacturers and electronics systems companies have experienced a downturn in demand and production which has resulted in reduced research and development spending by many of our customers many of these companies appear to have experienced a gradual recovery in 2004 and 2005 but they have continued to spend cautiously any economic downturn in the industries we serve could harm our business operating results and financial condition 

our failure to respond quickly to technological developments could make our products uncompetitive and obsolete 

  the industries in which we compete experience rapid silicon technology developments changes in industry standards changes in customer requirements and frequent new product introductions and improvements currently the industries we serve are experiencing several revolutionary trends 

 10    if we are unable to respond quickly and successfully to these developments we may lose our competitive position and our products or technologies may become uncompetitive or obsolete to compete successfully we must develop or acquire new products and improve our existing products and processes on a schedule that keeps pace with technological developments and the requirements for products addressing a broad spectrum of designers and designer expertise in our industries we must also be able to support a range of changing computer software hardware platforms and customer preferences we cannot guarantee that we will be successful in this effort 

we have experienced varied operating results and our operating results for any particular fiscal period are 

affected by the timing of significant orders for our software products fluctuations in customer preferences 

for license types and the timing of recognition of revenue under those license types 

  we have experienced and may continue to experience varied operating results in particular we have experienced net losses for some past periods and we may experience net losses in future periods various factors affect our operating results and some of them are not within our control our operating results for any period are affected by the timing of significant orders for our software products because a significant number of licenses for our software products are in excess of 50 million 

  our operating results are also affected by the mix of license types executed in any given period we license software using three different license types subscription term and perpetual product revenue associated with term and perpetual licenses is generally recognized at the beginning of the license period whereas product revenue associated with subscription licenses is recognized over multiple periods over the term of the license revenue may also be deferred under term and perpetual licenses until payments become due and payable from customers with nonlinear payment terms or as cash is collected from customers with lower credit ratings in addition revenue is impacted by the timing of license renewals the extent to which contracts contain flexible payment terms and the mix of license types ie perpetual term or subscription for existing customers which changes could have the effect of accelerating or delaying the recognition of revenue from the timing of recognition under the original contract 

  we plan operating expense levels primarily based on forecasted revenue levels these expenses and the impact of longterm commitments are relatively fixed in the short term a shortfall in revenue could lead to operating results below expectations because we may not be able to quickly reduce these fixed expenses in response to these shortterm business changes 

  you should not view our historical results of operations as reliable indicators of our future performance if revenue or operating results fall short of the levels expected by public market analysts and investors the trading price of our common stock could decline dramatically 

our future revenue is dependent in part upon our installed customer base continuing to license or buy 

additional products renew maintenance agreements and purchase additional services 

  our installed customer base has traditionally generated additional new license service and maintenance revenues in future periods customers may not necessarily license or buy additional products or contract for additional services or maintenance maintenance is generally renewable annually at a customer’s option and there are no mandatory payment obligations or obligations to license additional software if our customers decide not to renew their maintenance agreements or license additional products or contract for additional services or if they reduce the scope of the maintenance agreements our revenue could decrease which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

11 we may not receive significant revenue from our current research and development efforts for several years if at all 

  internally developing software products and integrating acquired software products into existing platforms is expensive and these investments often require a long time to generate returns our strategy involves significant investments in software research and development and related product opportunities we believe that we must continue to dedicate a significant amount of resources to our research and development efforts to maintain our competitive position however we cannot predict that we will receive significant if any revenue from these investments 

we have acquired and expect to acquire other companies and businesses and may not realize the expected benefits of these acquisitions 

  we have acquired and expect to acquire other companies and businesses in the future while we expect to carefully analyze each potential acquisition before committing to the transaction we may not be able to integrate and manage acquired products and businesses effectively in addition acquisitions involve a number of risks if any of the following events occurs after we acquire another business it could seriously harm our business operating results and financial condition 

   in a number of our acquisitions we have agreed to make future payments or earnouts based on the performance of the businesses we acquired the performance goals pursuant to which these future payments may be made generally relate to achievement by the acquired business of certain specified bookings revenue product proliferation product development or employee retention goals during a specified period following completion of the applicable acquisition future acquisitions may involve issuances of stock as payment of the purchase price for the acquired business grants of incentive stock or options to employees of the acquired businesses which may be dilutive to existing stockholders expenditure of substantial cash resources or the incurrence of material amounts of debt 

  the specific performance goal levels and amounts and timing of contingent purchase price payments vary with each acquisition in 2005 we recorded 275 million of goodwill for achieved earnouts payable to former stockholders of acquired companies the 275 million of earnouts consisted of 235 million of cash payments made prior to december 31 2005 the issuance of 01 million shares of cadence’s common stock valued at 13 million and 27 million accrued in accounts payable and accrued liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2005 

  in connection with our acquisitions completed prior to december 31 2005 we may be obligated to pay up to an aggregate of 270 million in cash during the next 12 months and an additional 70 million in cash in periods after the next 12 months through september 2008 if certain performance goals related to one or more of the following criteria are achieved in full revenue bookings product proliferation product development and employee retention 

12 our failure to attract train motivate and retain key employees may make us less competitive in our industries 

and therefore harm our results of operations 

  our business depends on the efforts and abilities of our senior management our research and development staff and a number of other key management sales support technical and services employees the high cost of training new employees not fully utilizing these employees or losing trained employees to competing employers could reduce our gross margins and harm our business and operating results competition for highly skilled employees can be intense particularly in geographic areas recognized as high technology centers such as the silicon valley area where our principal offices are located and the other locations where we maintain facilities if economic conditions continue to improve and job opportunities in the technology industry become more plentiful we may experience increased employee attrition and increased competition for skilled employees to attract retain and motivate individuals with the requisite expertise we may be required to grant large numbers of stock options or other stockbased incentive awards which may be dilutive to existing stockholders our adoption of statement of financial accounting standards or sfas no 123r “sharebased payments” during our first quarter of 2006 will result in additional equitybased compensation expense we may also be required to pay key employees significant base salaries and cash bonuses which could harm our operating results 

  in addition regulations adopted by nasdaq require stockholder approval for new equity compensation plans and significant amendments to existing plans including increases in shares available for issuance under such plans and prohibit nasdaq member organizations from giving a proxy to vote on equity compensation plans unless the beneficial owner of the shares has given voting instructions these regulations could make it more difficult for us to grant equity compensation to employees in the future to the extent that these regulations make it more difficult or expensive to grant equity compensation to employees we may incur increased compensation costs or find it difficult to attract retain and motivate employees which could materially and adversely affect our business 

the competition in our industries is substantial and we cannot assure you that we will be able to continue 

to successfully compete in our industries 

  the eda market and the commercial electronics design and methodology services industries are highly competitive if we fail to compete successfully in these industries it could seriously harm our business operating results and financial condition to compete in these industries we must identify and develop or acquire innovative and cost competitive eda products integrate them into platforms and market them in a timely manner we must also gain industry acceptance for our design and methodology services and offer better strategic concepts technical solutions prices and response time or a combination of these factors than those of other design companies and the internal design departments of electronics manufacturers we cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully in these industries factors that could affect our ability to succeed include 

 13   we compete in the eda products market primarily with synopsys inc mentor graphics corporation and magma design automation inc we also compete with numerous smaller eda companies with manufacturers of electronic devices that have developed or have the capability to develop their own eda products and with numerous electronics design and consulting companies manufacturers of electronic devices may be reluctant to purchase design and methodology services from independent vendors such as us because they wish to promote their own internal design departments 

we may need to change our pricing models to compete successfully 

  the highly competitive markets in which we compete can put pressure on us to reduce the prices of our products if our competitors offer deep discounts on certain products in an effort to recapture or gain market segment share or to sell other software or hardware products we may then need to lower our prices or offer other favorable terms to compete successfully any such changes would be likely to reduce our profit margins and could adversely affect our operating results any broadlybased changes to our prices and pricing policies could cause sales and software license revenues to decline or be delayed as our sales force implements and our customers adjust to the new pricing policies some of our competitors may bundle products for promotional purposes or as a longterm pricing strategy or provide guarantees of prices and product implementations these practices could over time significantly constrain the prices that we can charge for our products if we cannot offset price reductions with a corresponding increase in the number of sales or with lower spending then the reduced license revenues resulting from lower prices could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

we rely on our proprietary technology as well as software and other intellectual property rights licensed to 

us by third parties and we cannot assure you that the precautions taken to protect our rights will be 

adequate or that we will continue to be able to adequately secure such intellectual property rights from 

third parties 

  our success depends in part upon our proprietary technology we generally rely on patents copyrights trademarks trade secret laws licenses and restrictive agreements to establish and protect our proprietary rights in technology and products despite precautions we may take to protect our intellectual property we cannot assure you that third parties will not try to challenge invalidate or circumvent these safeguards we also cannot assure you that the rights granted under our patents or attendant to our other intellectual property will provide us with any competitive advantages or that patents will be issued on any of our pending applications or that future patents will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology furthermore the laws of foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights in those countries to the same extent as applicable law protects these rights in the united states many of our products include software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties we may have to seek new or renew existing licenses for such software and other intellectual property in the future our design and methodology services business holds licenses to certain software and other intellectual property owned by third parties including that of our competitors our failure to obtain for our use software or other intellectual property licenses or other intellectual property rights on favorable terms or the need to engage in litigation over these licenses or rights could seriously harm our business operating results and financial condition 

we could lose key technology or suffer serious harm to our business because of the infringement of our 

intellectual property rights by third parties or because of our infringement of the intellectual property 

rights of third parties 

  there are numerous patents in the eda industry and new patents are being issued at a rapid rate it is not always practicable to determine in advance whether a product or any of its components infringes the patent rights of others as a result from time to time we may be compelled to respond to or prosecute intellectual property infringement claims to protect our rights or defend a customer’s rights these claims regardless of merit could consume valuable management time result in costly litigation or cause product shipment delays all of which could seriously harm our business operating results and financial condition in settling these claims we may be required to enter into royalty or licensing agreements with the third parties claiming 

14 infringement these royalty or licensing agreements if available may not have terms favorable to us being compelled to enter into a license agreement with unfavorable terms could seriously harm our business operating results and financial condition any potential intellectual property litigation could compel us to do one or more of the following 

   if we were compelled to take any of these actions our business and results of operations may suffer 

if our security measures are breached and an unauthorized party obtains access to customer data our 

information systems may be perceived as being unsecure and customers may curtail their use of or stop 

their use of our products and services 

  our products and services involve the storage and transmission of customers’ proprietary information and breaches of our security measures could expose us to a risk of loss or misuse of this information litigation and potential liability because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage information systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventive measures if an actual or perceived breach of our security occurs the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed and we could lose existing customers and our ability to obtain new customers 

we may not be able to effectively implement our restructuring activities and our restructuring activities 

may not result in the expected benefits which would negatively impact our future results of operations 

  the eda market and the commercial electronics design and methodology services industries are highly competitive and change quickly we have responded to increased competition and changes in the industries in which we compete in part by restructuring our operations and reducing the size of our workforce despite our restructuring efforts over the last few years we cannot assure you that we will achieve all of the operating expense reductions and improvements in operating margins and cash flows currently anticipated from these restructuring activities in the periods contemplated or at all our inability to realize these benefits and our failure to appropriately structure our business to meet market conditions could negatively impact our results of operations 

  as part of our recent restructuring activities we have reduced the workforce in certain revenuegenerating portions of our business this reduction in staffing levels could require us to forego certain future opportunities due to resource limitations which could negatively affect our longterm revenues 

  in addition these workforce reductions could result in a lack of focus and reduced productivity by remaining employees due to changes in responsibilities or concern about future prospects which in turn may negatively affect our future revenues further we believe our future success depends in large part on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled personnel our restructuring activities could negatively affect our ability to attract such personnel as a result of perceived risk of future workforce reductions 

  during fiscal year ended december 31 2005 we implemented a new plan of restructuring we also cannot assure you that we will not be required to implement further restructuring activities or reductions in our workforce based on changes in the markets and industries in which we compete or that any future restructuring efforts will be successful 

15 the long sales cycle of our products and services makes the timing of our revenue difficult to predict and 

may cause our operating results to fluctuate unexpectedly 

  we have a long sales cycle that generally extends at least three to six months the length of the sales cycle may cause our revenue and operating results to vary from quarter to quarter the complexity and expense associated with our business generally requires a lengthy customer education evaluation and approval process consequently we may incur substantial expenses and devote significant management effort and expense to develop potential relationships that do not result in agreements or revenue and may prevent us from pursuing other opportunities 

  in addition sales of our products and services may be delayed if customers delay approval or commencement of projects because of 

   long sales cycles for acceleration and emulation hardware products subject us to a number of significant risks over which we have limited control including insufficient excess or obsolete inventory variations in inventory valuation and fluctuations in quarterly operating results 

  also because of the timing of large orders and our customers’ buying patterns we may not learn of bookings shortfalls revenue shortfalls earnings shortfalls or other failures to meet market expectations until late in a fiscal quarter which could cause even more immediate and serious harm to the trading price of our common stock 

the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations and other risks to our international operations may 

seriously harm our financial condition 

  we have significant operations outside the united states our revenue from international operations as a percentage of total revenue was approximately 54 in 2005 50 in 2004 and 44 in 2003 we expect that revenue from our international operations will continue to account for a significant portion of our total revenue we also transact business in various foreign currencies recent economic and political uncertainty and the volatility of foreign currencies in certain regions most notably the japanese yen european union euro and the british pound have had and may in the future have a harmful effect on our revenue and operating results 

  fluctuations in the rate of exchange between the united states dollar and the currencies of other countries in which we conduct business could seriously harm our business operating results and financial condition for example if there is an increase in the rate at which a foreign currency exchanges into united states dollars it will take more of the foreign currency to equal the same amount of united states dollars than before the rate increase if we price our products and services in the foreign currency we will receive fewer united states dollars than we did before the rate increase went into effect if we price our products and services in united states dollars an increase in the exchange rate will result in an increase in the price for our products and services compared to those products of our competitors that are priced in local currency this could result in our prices being uncompetitive in markets where business is transacted in the local currency 

  exposure to foreign currency transaction risk can arise when transactions are conducted in a currency different from the functional currency of one of our subsidiaries a subsidiary’s functional currency is generally the currency in which it primarily conducts its operations including product pricing expenses and borrowings although we attempt to reduce the impact of foreign currency fluctuations significant exchange rate movements may hurt our results of operations as expressed in united states dollars 

  our international operations may also be subject to other risks including 

 16    we have offices throughout the world including key research facilities outside of the united states our operations are dependent upon the connectivity of our operations throughout the world activities that interfere with our international connectivity such as computer “hacking” or the introduction of a virus into our computer systems could significantly interfere with our business operations 

our operating results could be adversely affected as a result of changes in our effective tax rates 

  our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by the following 

   any significant change in our future effective tax rates could adversely impact our results of operations for future periods 

we have received an examination report from the internal revenue service proposing a tax deficiency in 

certain of our tax returns and the outcome of current and future tax examinations may have a material 

adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows 

  the internal revenue service or irs and other tax authorities regularly examine our income tax returns in november 2003 the irs completed its field examination of our federal income tax returns for the tax years 1997 through 1999 and issued a revenue agent’s report or rar in which the irs proposes to assess an aggregate tax deficiency for the threeyear period of approximately 1430 million plus interest which interest will accrue until the matter is resolved this interest is compounded daily at rates published by the irs which rates are adjusted quarterly and have been between four and nine percent since 1997 the rar is not a final statutory notice of deficiency and we have filed a protest to certain of the proposed adjustments with the appeals office of the irs where the matter is currently being considered the irs may also make similar claims for years subsequent to 1999 

  the most significant of the disputed adjustments relates to transfer pricing arrangements that we have with a foreign subsidiary we believe that the proposed irs adjustments are inconsistent with the applicable tax laws and that we have meritorious defenses to the proposed adjustments we are challenging these proposed adjustments vigorously 

  the irs is currently examining our federal income tax returns for tax years 2000 through 2002 and may challenge the tax reported on these tax returns 

  significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from tax examinations including the current irs examination and the irs rar for the tax years 1997 through 1999 we provide for tax liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets unless we consider it probable 

17 that additional taxes will not be due however the ultimate outcome of tax examinations cannot be predicted with certainty including the total amount payable or the timing of any such payments upon resolution of these issues in addition we cannot assure you that such amount will not be materially different than that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals should the irs or other tax authorities assess additional taxes as a result of a current or a future examination we may be required to record charges to operations in future periods that could have a material impact on the results of operations financial position or cash flows in the applicable period or periods recorded 

forecasting our estimated annual effective tax rate is complex and subject to uncertainty and material 

differences between forecasted and actual tax rates could have a material impact on our results of 

operations 

  forecasts of our income tax position and resultant effective tax rate are complex and subject to uncertainty because our income tax position for each year combines the effects of a mix of profits and losses earned by us and our subsidiaries in tax jurisdictions with a broad range of income tax rates as well as benefits from available deferred tax assets and costs resulting from tax audits to forecast our global tax rate pretax profits and losses by jurisdiction are estimated and tax expense by jurisdiction is calculated if the mix of profits and losses our ability to use tax credits or effective tax rates by jurisdiction is different than those estimates our actual tax rate could be materially different than forecasted which could have a material impact on our results of operations 

failure to obtain export licenses could harm our business by rendering us unable to ship products and transfer 

our technology outside of the united states 

  we must comply with united states department of commerce regulations in shipping our software products and transferring our technology outside the united states and to foreign nationals although we have not had any significant difficulty complying with these regulations so far any significant future difficulty in complying with such regulations could harm our business operating results and financial condition 

errors or defects in our products and services could expose us to liability and harm our reputation 

  our customers use our products and services in designing and developing products that involve a high degree of technological complexity each of which has its own specifications because of the complexity of the systems and products with which we work some of our products and designs can be adequately tested only when put to full use in the marketplace as a result our customers or their end users may discover errors or defects in our software or the systems we design or the products or systems incorporating our design and intellectual property may not operate as expected errors or defects could result in 

 new accounting standards related to equity compensation will cause us to recognize additional expense 

  in december 2004 the financial accounting standards board or fasb issued sfas no 123r which requires the measurement of all sharebased payments to employees including grants of employee stock options using a fairvaluebased method and the recording of such expense in our consolidated statements of operations we are required to adopt sfas no 123r in our first quarter of fiscal 2006 we expect the adoption of sfas no 123r to have a significant adverse effect on our consolidated statements of operations net income loss per share and consolidated statements of cash flows 

18 if we become subject to unfair hiring claims we could be prevented from hiring needed employees incur 

liability for damages and incur substantial costs in defending ourselves 

  companies in our industry whose employees accept positions with competitors frequently claim that these competitors have engaged in unfair hiring practices or that the employment of these persons would involve the disclosure or use of trade secrets these claims could prevent us from hiring employees or cause us to incur liability for damages we could also incur substantial costs in defending ourselves or our employees against these claims regardless of their merits defending ourselves from these claims could also divert the attention of our management away from our operations 

our business is subject to the risk of earthquakes floods and other natural catastrophic events 

  our corporate headquarters including certain of our research and development operations and certain of our distribution facilities are located in the silicon valley area of northern california which is a region known to experience seismic activity in addition several of our facilities including our corporate headquarters certain of our research and development operations and certain of our distribution operations are in areas of san jose california that have been identified by the director of the federal emergency management agency or fema as being located in a special flood area the areas at risk are identified as being in a one hundred year flood plain using fema’s flood hazard boundary map or the flood insurance rate map if significant seismic or flooding activity were to occur our operations may be interrupted which would adversely impact our business and results of operations 

we maintain research and other facilities in parts of the world that are not as politically stable as the 

united states and as a result we may face a higher risk of business interruption from acts of war or 

terrorism than businesses located only or primarily in the united states 

  we maintain international research and other facilities some of which are in parts of the world that are not as politically stable as the united states consequently we may face a greater risk of business interruption as a result of terrorist acts or military conflicts than businesses located domestically furthermore this potential harm is exacerbated given that damage to or disruptions at our international research and development facilities could have an adverse effect on our ability to develop new or improve existing products as compared to other businesses which may only have sales offices or other less critical operations abroad we are not insured for losses or interruptions caused by acts of war or terrorism 

risks related to our securities and our debt obligations 

our debt obligations expose us to risks that could adversely affect our business operating results and financial 

condition and could prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under such indebtedness 

  we have a substantial level of debt as of december 31 2005 we had 4200 million of outstanding indebtedness from our zero coupon zero yield senior convertible notes due 2023 or the notes that we issued in august 2003 and a 1600 million term loan borrowed by a whollyowned irish subsidiary and guaranteed by cadence the level of our indebtedness among other things could 

 19   if we experience a decline in revenue due to any of the factors described in this item 1a “risk factors” or otherwise we could have difficulty paying amounts due on our indebtedness in the case of the notes although the notes mature in 2023 the holders of the notes may require us to repurchase their notes at an additional premium of 025 in 2008 which makes it probable that we will be required to repurchase the notes in 2008 if the notes are not otherwise converted into our common stock if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow or otherwise obtain funds necessary to make required payments or if we fail to comply with the various requirements of our indebtedness including the notes and the term loan we would be in default which would permit the holders of our indebtedness to accelerate the maturity of the indebtedness and could cause defaults under our other indebtedness any default under our indebtedness could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

  the terms of the notes do not prohibit us from incurring additional debt in addition our outstanding indebtedness under the notes does not restrict our ability to pay dividends issue or repurchase stock or other securities or require us to achieve or maintain any minimum financial results relating to our financial position or results of operations although the notes do not contain such financial and other restrictive covenants the documents governing the term loan do include such covenants including certain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness and liens disposition of assets payment of cash dividends by us to our stockholders and our ability to engage in certain corporate transactions we are also required to maintain certain minimum interest coverage and leverage ratios under the term loan we are required to repay the principal amount thereof over a three year period see “other factors affecting liquidity and capital resources” in item 7 below if we incur additional indebtedness or other liabilities our ability to pay our obligations on our outstanding indebtedness could be adversely affected 

we may be unable to adequately service our indebtedness which may result in defaults and other costs to us 

  we may not have sufficient funds or may be unable to arrange for additional financing to pay the outstanding obligations due on our indebtedness any future borrowing arrangements or debt agreements to which we become a party may contain additional restrictions on or prohibitions against our repayment on our outstanding indebtedness or otherwise have the effect of making it more difficult to repay our existing outstanding indebtedness with respect to the notes at maturity the entire outstanding principal amount of the notes will become due and payable holders may require us to repurchase for cash all or any portion of the notes on august 15 2008 for 10025 of the principal amount august 15 2013 for 10000 of the principal amount and august 15 2018 for 10000 of the principal amount as a result although the notes mature in 2023 the holders may require us to repurchase the notes at an additional premium in 2008 which makes it probable that we will be required to repurchase the notes in 2008 if the notes are not otherwise converted into our common stock if we are prohibited from paying our outstanding indebtedness we could try to obtain the consent of lenders under those arrangements or we could attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain the restrictions if we do not obtain the necessary consents or refinance the borrowings we may be unable to satisfy our outstanding indebtedness any such failure would constitute an event of default under our indebtedness which could in turn constitute a default under the terms of any other indebtedness then outstanding 

  in addition a material default on our indebtedness could suspend our eligibility to register securities using certain registration statement forms under sec guidelines which permit incorporation by reference of substantial information regarding us which could potentially hinder our ability to raise capital through the issuance of our securities and will increase the costs of such registration to us 

conversion of the notes will dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders 

  the terms of the notes permit the holders to convert the notes into shares of our common stock the notes are convertible into our common stock initially at a conversion price of 1565 per share which would result in an aggregate of approximately 268 million shares of our common stock being issued upon conversion subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events the conversion of some or all of the notes will dilute the ownership interest of our existing stockholders any sales in the public market of the common stock issuable upon conversion could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock prior to the 

20 conversion of the notes if the trading price of our common stock exceeds the conversion price of the notes by 14500 or more over specified periods basic earnings per share will be diluted if and to the extent the convertible notes hedge instruments are not exercised the holders of the notes may require us to repurchase for cash all or any portion of their notes on august 15 2008 for 10025 of the principal amount on august 15 2013 for 10000 of the principal amount or on august 15 2018 for 10000 of the principal amount by providing to the paying agent a written repurchase notice the repurchase notice must be delivered during the period commencing 30 business days prior to the relevant repurchase date and ending on the close of business on the business day prior to the relevant repurchase date we may redeem for cash all or any part of the notes on or after august 15 2008 for 10000 of the principal amount except for those notes that holders have required us to repurchase on august 15 2008 or on other repurchase dates as described above 

  each 1000 of principal of the notes is initially convertible into 63879 shares of our common stock subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events holders of the notes may convert their notes prior to maturity only if 1 the price of our common stock reaches 2269 during certain periods of time specified in the notes 2 specified corporate transactions occur 3 the notes have been called for redemption or 4 the trading price of the notes falls below a certain threshold as a result although the notes mature in 2023 the holders may require us to repurchase their notes at an additional premium in 2008 which makes it probable that we will be required to repurchase the notes in 2008 if the notes are not otherwise converted into our common stock as of december 31 2005 none of the conditions allowing holders of the notes to convert had been met 

  although the conversion price is currently 1565 per share the convertible notes hedge and warrant transactions that we entered into in connection with the issuance of the notes effectively increased the conversion price of the notes until 2008 to approximately 2308 per share which would result in an aggregate issuance upon conversion prior to august 15 2008 of approximately 182 million shares of our common stock we have entered into convertible notes hedge and warrant transactions to reduce the potential dilution from the conversion of the notes however we cannot guarantee that such convertible notes hedge and warrant instruments will fully mitigate the dilution in addition the existence of the notes may encourage short selling by market participants because the conversion of the notes could depress the price of our common stock 

we may at the option of the noteholders and only in certain circumstances be required to repurchase the 

notes in cash or shares of our common stock 

  under the terms of the notes we may be required to repurchase the notes following a significant change in our corporate ownership or structure such as a change of control prior to maturity of the notes following a significant change in our corporate ownership or structure in certain circumstances we may choose to pay the repurchase price of the notes in cash shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock if we choose to pay all or any part of the repurchase price of the notes in shares of our common stock this would result in dilution to the holders of our common stock 

convertible notes hedge and warrant transactions entered into in connection with the issuance of the 

notes may affect the value of our common stock 

  we entered into convertible notes hedge transactions with jp morgan chase bank an affiliate of one of the initial purchasers of the notes at the time of issuance of the notes with the objective of reducing the potential dilutive effect of issuing our common stock upon conversion of the notes we also entered into warrant transactions in connection with our convertible notes hedge and warrant transactions jp morgan chase bank or its affiliates purchased our common stock in secondary market transactions and entered into various overthe counter derivative transactions with respect to our common stock this entity or its affiliates is likely to modify its hedge positions from time to time prior to conversion or maturity of the notes by purchasing and selling shares of our common stock other of our securities or other instruments it may wish to use in connection with such hedging any of these transactions and activities could adversely affect the value of our common stock and as a result the number of shares and the value of the common stock holders will receive upon conversion of the notes in addition subject to movement in the price of our common stock if 

21 the convertible notes hedge transactions settle in our favor we could be exposed to credit risk related to the other party 

rating agencies may provide unsolicited ratings on the notes that could reduce the market value or 

liquidity of our common stock 

  we have not requested a rating of the notes from any rating agency and we do not anticipate that the notes will be rated however if one or more rating agencies independently elects to rate the notes and assigns the notes a rating lower than the rating expected by investors or reduces such rating in the future the market price or liquidity of the notes and our common stock could be harmed a resulting decline in the market price of the notes as compared to the price of our common stock may require us to repurchase the notes 

antitakeover defenses in our governing documents and certain provisions under delaware law could 

prevent an acquisition of our company or limit the price that investors might be willing to pay for our 

common stock 

  our governing documents and certain provisions of the delaware general corporation law could make it difficult for another company to acquire control of our company for example 

   all or any one of these factors could limit the price that certain investors would be willing to pay for shares of our common stock and could delay prevent or allow our board of directors to resist an acquisition of our company even if the proposed transaction were favored by a majority of our independent stockholders

 item 3 legal proceedings tableend   from time to time we are involved in various disputes and litigation matters that arise in the ordinary course of business these include disputes and lawsuits related to intellectual property mergers and acquisitions licensing contract law distribution arrangements and employee relations matters periodically we review the status of each significant matter and assess its potential financial exposure if the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount or the range of loss can be estimated we accrue a liability for the estimated loss in accordance with sfas no 5 “accounting for contingencies” legal proceedings are subject to uncertainties and the outcomes are difficult to predict because of such uncertainties accruals are based only on the best information available at the time as additional information becomes available we reassess the potential liability related to pending claims and litigation matters and may revise estimates 

  while the outcome of these disputes and litigation matters cannot be predicted with any certainty management does not believe that the outcome of any current matters will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations

overview 

general 

  we develop electronic design automation or eda software and intellectual property we license software sell or license intellectual property sell or lease hardware technology and provide design and methodology services throughout the world to help manage and accelerate electronics product development processes our broad range of products and services are used by the world’s leading electronics companies to design and develop complex integrated circuits or ics and personal and commercial electronics systems 

  during the last decade the communications business productivity and consumer electronics markets accounted for much of the growth in the electronics industry everdecreasing silicon manufacturing process geometries coupled with the move to 300 millimeter wafer production are causing ic unit cost decreases this has enabled dieperwafer volume efficiencies and increased complexity for manufacturers of electronic devices at the same time the development of ics with greater functionality makes it more difficult to effectively integrate these components into complete electronics systems these market and technology forces create major challenges for the global electronics design community while simultaneously offering significant opportunities for providers of eda products and services in response to these opportunities we have initiated significant restructuring activities over the past several years including during the year ended december 31 2005 to better align our cost structure with projected demand for our products and services 

  we have identified certain items that management uses as performance indicators to manage our business including revenue certain elements of operating expenses and cash flow from operations and we describe these items more fully in the “results of operations” below 

acquisitions 

  we have acquired companies businesses and technology some of which are described below and we expect to acquire other companies businesses and technology in the future we undertake these acquisitions as part of our overall business strategy and specifically to acquire key personnel technology and customer relationships of the acquired business for each of these acquisitions the results of operations and the estimated fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed have been included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of the acquisition these acquisitions are described in more detail below and in note 4 to our consolidated financial statements 

28   comparative pro forma financial information was not presented for the acquisitions completed in 2005 2004 or 2003 because these acquisitions were not material to our consolidated financial statements either individually or in the aggregate 

  a summary of certain information regarding acquisitions all of which were for cash we completed in 2005 2004 and 2003 including the aggregate initial purchase price paid is as follows 

   the businesses or assets acquired include 

       the purchase prices of our acquisitions generally consist of one or more of the following cash payments shares of our common stock the fair value of assumed options if any and acquisition costs the purchase price and goodwill associated with certain business acquisitions will be greater than the initial purchase price paid if certain performance goals are achieved generally over a period of up to four years following the completion of the respective acquisition related to one or more of the following revenue bookings product proliferation product development and employee retention 

  concurrent with our acquisition of certain innotech assets we also modified our distributor agreement with innotech prior to this acquisition we licensed most of our software products in japan through innotech we now directly license our software products to the customers for which we acquired the distribution rights from innotech as of december 31 2005 we were an approximately 7 stockholder of innotech 

acquisitionrelated earnouts 

  for many of our acquisitions of private companies a portion of the purchase price is payable only after the acquired business group’s achievement of certain performance goals which generally relate to one or more of the following revenue bookings product proliferation product development and employee retention the specific performance goal levels and amounts and timing of contingent purchase price payments vary with each acquisition in connection with some acquisitions we may grant equity awards with either timebased or performancebased vesting or a combination of both to employees of the acquired business as performance incentives as a result the amount of cash consideration or shares of our common stock issued to former stockholders of the acquired entity will increase as the performance goals are achieved generally over a period 

29 of up to four years following the completion of the respective acquisition accordingly goodwill and stock compensation expense will increase upon the attainment of such goals 

  in connection with our acquisitions completed prior to december 31 2005 we may be obligated to pay up to an aggregate of 270 million in cash during the next 12 months and an additional 70 million in cash in periods after the next 12 months through september 2008 if certain performance goals related to one or more of the following criteria are achieved in full revenue bookings product proliferation product development and employee retention 

  the goodwill recorded in connection with the belowdescribed contingent earnouts for acquisitions is not expected to be deductible for income tax purposes 

  2005 earnouts 

  during the year ended december 31 2005 we recorded 275 million of goodwill for achieved earnouts payable to former stockholders of acquired companies the 275 million of earnouts consisted of 235 million of cash payments made prior to december 31 2005 the issuance of 01 million shares of our common stock valued at 13 million and 27 million accrued in accounts payable and accrued liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2005

  during 2004 we recorded 406 million of goodwill as contingent purchase price payable to stockholders of acquired companies the 406 million of goodwill consisted of 170 million of actual cash payments 72 million of accrued payments and the issuance of 11 million shares of our common stock valued at 164 million in addition we recognized stock compensation expense of 12 million in connection with these acquisitions in accordance with fasb interpretation no 44 “accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation an interpretation of apb no 25” 

  2003 earnouts 

  during 2003 we paid 24 million in cash and issued or reserved for issuance an additional 37 million shares of our common stock valued at 577 million related to acquisition earnouts we recorded 523 million in additional goodwill consisting of 24 million in cash and 499 million representing the issuance or reserve for issuance of 32 million shares we also recorded additional stock compensation expense of 78 million representing the issuance or reserve for issuance of 04 million shares for earnouts achieved during 2003 in addition we recorded 05 million in deferred stock compensation for estimated future earnouts in accordance with fasb interpretation no 28 “accounting for stock appreciation rights and other variable stock option or award plans” 

legal settlements 

  in september 2003 we entered into a settlement with mentor graphics corporation pursuant to which cadence mentor and their respective affiliated parties settled all outstanding litigation between the companies and such affiliated parties relating to emulation and acceleration systems the companies also agreed that for a period of seven years neither will sue the other over patented emulation and acceleration technology mentor also paid us 180 million in cash as part of the settlement net of related legal costs we recorded a gain of 145 million during the year ended january 3 2004 for the settlement 

critical accounting estimates 

  in preparing our consolidated financial statements we make assumptions judgments and estimates that can have a significant impact on our revenue operating income loss and net income loss as well as on the value of certain assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets we base our assumptions judgments and estimates on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different 

30 assumptions or conditions on a regular basis we evaluate our assumptions judgments and estimates and make changes accordingly we believe that the assumptions judgments and estimates involved in the accounting for revenue recognition accounting for income taxes valuation of longlived and intangible assets restructuring charges and valuation of stockbased awards have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements therefore we consider these to be our critical accounting estimates historically our assumptions judgments and estimates relative to our critical accounting estimates have not differed materially from actual results for further information on our significant accounting policies see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition 

  we apply the provisions of statement of position or sop 972 “software revenue recognition” as amended by sop 989 “modification of sop 972 software revenue recognition with respect to certain transactions” to all product revenue transactions where the software is not incidental we also apply the provisions of sfas no 13 “accounting for leases” to all hardware lease transactions we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists the product has been delivered the fee is fixed or determinable collection of the resulting receivable is probable and vendorspecific objective evidence of fair value or vsoe exists 

  we license software using three different license types 

   persuasive evidence of an arrangement  — generally we use the customer signed contract as evidence of an arrangement for subscription and term licenses and hardware leases if a customer signed contract does not exist we have historically used a purchase order as evidence of an arrangement for perpetual licenses hardware sales maintenance renewals and small fixedprice service projects such as training classes and small methodology service engagements of approximately 10000 or less for all other service engagements we use a signed professional services agreement and a statement of work to evidence an arrangement in cases where both a signed contract and a purchase order exist we consider the signed contract to be the most persuasive evidence of the arrangement sales through our distributors are evidenced by a master agreement governing the relationship together with binding purchase orders from the distributor on a transactionbytransaction basis 

  product delivery  — software and the corresponding access keys are generally delivered to customers electronically electronic delivery occurs when we provide the customer access to the software occasionally we will deliver the software on a compact disc with standard transfer terms of freeon board or fob shipping point our software license agreements generally do not contain conditions for acceptance with respect to hardware delivery of an entire system is deemed to occur upon its successful installation for certain hardware products installation is the responsibility of the customer as the system is fully functional at the time of shipment for these products delivery is deemed to be complete when the products are shipped with freight terms of fob shipping point 

31   fee is fixed or determinable  — we assess whether a fee is fixed or determinable at the outset of the arrangement primarily based on the payment terms associated with the transaction we have established a history of collecting under the original contract without providing concessions on payments products or services for our installment contracts that do not include a substantial up front payment we may only determine that a fee is fixed or determinable if the arrangement has payment periods that are equal to or less than the term of the licenses and the payments are collected in equal or nearly equal installments when evaluated over the entire term of the arrangement 

  significant judgment is involved in assessing whether a fee is fixed or determinable including assessing whether a contract amendment to a term arrangement constitutes a concession our experience has been that we are able to determine whether a fee is fixed or determinable for term licenses while we do not expect that experience to change if we no longer were to have a history of collecting under the original contract without providing concessions on term licenses revenue from term licenses would be required to be recognized when payments under the installment contract become due and payable such a change could have a material impact on our results of operations 

  collection is probable  — we have concluded that collection is not probable for license arrangements executed with customers in certain countries for all other countries we assess the probability of collecting from each customer at the outset of the arrangement based on a number of factors including the customer’s payment history and its current creditworthiness if in our judgment collection of a fee is not probable we defer the revenue until the uncertainty is removed which generally means revenue is recognized upon our receipt of cash payment our experience has been that we are able to estimate whether collection is probable while we do not expect that experience to change if we were to determine that collection is not probable for any license arrangement particularly those with installment payment terms revenue from such license would be recognized generally upon the receipt of cash payment such a change could have a material impact on our results of operations 

  vendorspecific objective evidence of fair value  — our vsoe for certain product elements of an arrangement is based upon the pricing in comparable transactions when the element is sold separately vsoe for maintenance is generally based upon the customer’s stated annual renewal rates vsoe for services is generally based on the price charged when the services are sold separately for multiple element arrangements vsoe must exist to allocate the total fee among all delivered and undelivered elements of the arrangement if vsoe does not exist for all elements to support the allocation of the total fee among all delivered and undelivered elements of the arrangement revenue is deferred until such evidence does exist for the undelivered elements or until all elements are delivered whichever is earlier if vsoe of all undelivered elements exists but vsoe does not exist for one or more delivered elements revenue is recognized using the residual method under the residual method the vsoe of the undelivered elements is deferred and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee is recognized as revenue as the elements are delivered our experience has been that we are able to estimate vsoe while we do not expect that experience to change if we could no longer support vsoe for undelivered elements of multiple element arrangements revenue would be deferred until we have vsoe for the undelivered elements or all elements are delivered whichever is earlier such a change could have a material impact on our results of operations 

  finance fee revenue  — finance fees result from discounting to present value the product revenue derived from our installment contracts in which the payment terms extend beyond one year from the effective date of the contract finance fees are recognized using a method that approximates the effective interest method over the relevant license term and are classified as product revenue finance fee revenue represented 2 of total revenue for each of the years ended december 31 2005 and january 1 2005 and 1 of total revenue for the year ended january 3 2004 upon the sale of an installment contract we recognize the remaining finance fee revenue associated with the installment contract 

  services revenue  — services revenue consists primarily of revenue received for performing design and methodology services these services are not related to the functionality of the products licensed revenue from service contracts is recognized either on the time and materials method as work is performed or on the percentageof completion method for contracts with fixed or notto exceed fees we estimate on a monthly 

32 basis the percentageof completion which is based on the completion of milestones relating to the arrangement we have a history of accurately estimating project status and the costs necessary to complete projects a number of internal and external factors can affect our estimates including labor rates utilization and efficiency variances and specification and testing requirement changes if different conditions were to prevail such that accurate estimates could not be made then the use of the completed contract method would be required and the recognition of all revenue and costs would be deferred until the project was completed such a change could have a material impact on our results of operations 

accounting for income taxes 

  we provide for the effect of income taxes in our consolidated financial statements in accordance with sfas no 109 “accounting for income taxes” under sfas no 109 income tax expense benefit is recognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and for deferred tax assets and liabilities for the tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity’s financial statements or tax returns 

  we must make significant assumptions judgments and estimates to determine our current provision for income taxes our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance to be recorded against our deferred tax assets our judgments assumptions and estimates relating to the current provision for income taxes take into account current tax laws our interpretation of current tax laws and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax authorities changes in tax laws or our interpretation of tax laws and developments in current and future tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our results of operations financial position or cash flows our assumptions judgments and estimates relating to the value of our net deferred tax assets take into account predictions of the amount and category of future taxable income from potential sources including tax planning strategies that would if necessary be implemented to prevent a loss carryforward or tax credit carryforward from expiring unused actual operating results and the underlying amount and category of income in future years could render our current assumptions judgments and estimates of recoverable net deferred taxes inaccurate thus materially affecting our results of operations and financial position 

  see the factors affecting future results above in item 1a “risk factors” entitled “our operating results could be adversely affected as a result of changes in our effective tax rates” “we have received an examination report from the internal revenue service proposing a tax deficiency in certain of our tax returns and the outcome of current and future tax examinations may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows” and “forecasting our estimated annual effective tax rate is complex and subject to uncertainty and material differences between forecasted and actual tax rates could have a material impact on our results of operations” 

valuation of longlived and intangible assets 

  we review longlived assets including certain identifiable intangibles for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that we will not be able to recover the asset’s carrying amount in accordance with sfas no 144 “accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets” 

  for longlived assets to be held and used including acquired intangibles we initiate our review whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a longlived asset may not be recoverable recoverability of an asset is measured by comparing its carrying amount to the expected future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of that asset excluding future interest costs that would be recognized as an expense when incurred any impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair market value significant management judgment is required in 

 33   in future periods material impairment charges could be necessary should different conditions prevail or different judgments be made 

restructuring charges 

  we account for restructuring charges in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 100 “restructuring and impairment charges” as amended since fiscal 2001 we have undertaken significant restructuring initiatives all restructuring activities initiated prior to fiscal 2003 were accounted for in accordance with emerging issues task force or eitf no 943 “liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring” and eitf no 8810 “costs associated with lease modifications or terminations” for restructuring activities initiated after fiscal 2002 we accounted for the leased facilities in accordance with sfas no 146 “accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities” in addition for all periods presented we accounted for the assetrelated portions of these restructurings in accordance with sfas no 144 “accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets” for all periods presented the severance and benefits charges were accounted for in accordance with sfas no 112 “employers’ accounting for postemployment benefits — an amendment of fasb statements no 5 and 43” 

  these restructuring initiatives have required us to make a number of estimates and assumptions related to losses on excess facilities vacated or consolidated particularly estimating when if at all we will be able to sublet vacated facilities and if we do the sublease terms closure and space reduction costs that are part of our restructuring charges include payments required under leases less any applicable estimated sublease income after the facilities are abandoned lease buyout costs and certain contractual costs to maintain facilities during the abandonment period 

  in addition we have recorded estimated provisions for termination benefits and outplacement costs and other restructuring costs we regularly evaluate the adequacy of our restructuring accrual and adjust the balance based on changes in estimates and assumptions we may incur future charges for new restructuring activities as well as changes in estimates to amounts previously recorded 

valuation of stockbased awards 

  beginning in the first quarter of 2006 we will account for stockbased compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 123r under sfas no 123r stockbased compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period determining the fair value of stockbased awards at the grant date requires judgment including estimating the expected term of stock options the expected volatility of our stock and expected dividends in addition judgment is also required in estimating the amount of stockbased awards that are expected to be forfeited if actual results differ significantly from these estimates stockbased compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially affected 

results of operations 

  we primarily generate revenue from licensing our eda software selling or leasing our hardware technology selling or licensing our intellectual property providing maintenance for our software and hardware and providing design and methodology services we principally utilize three license types subscription term and perpetual the different license types provide a customer with different terms of use for our products such as i the right to access new technology ii the duration of the license and iii payment terms customer decisions regarding these aspects of license transactions determine the license type timing of revenue recognition and potential future business activity for example if a customer chooses a fixed term of use this will result in either a subscription or term license a business implication of this decision is that at the expiration of the license period the customer must decide whether to continue using the technology and therefore renew the license agreement because larger customers generally use products from two or more of our five product groups rarely will a large customer completely terminate its relationship with us at expiration 

34 of the license see “critical accounting estimates” above for additional discussion of license types and timing of revenue recognition 

  a substantial portion of our revenue is recognized over multiple periods as a result we do not believe that pricing volatility has been a material component of the change in our revenue from period to period 

  the amount of revenue recognized in future periods will depend on among other things the terms and timing of our contract renewals or additional product sales with existing customers the size of such transactions and sales to new customers 

  the value and duration of contracts and consequently product revenue recognized is affected by the competitiveness of our products product revenue recognized in any period is also affected by the extent to which customers purchase subscription term or perpetual licenses and the extent to which contracts contain flexible payment terms the timing of product revenue recognition is also affected by changes in the extent to which existing contracts contain flexible payment terms and changes in contractual arrangements eg subscription to term with existing customers 

revenue and revenue mix 

  we analyze our software and hardware businesses by product group combining revenues for both product and maintenance because of their interrelationship we have formulated a design solution strategy that combines our design technologies into “platforms” which are included in the various product groups described below 

  our product groups are 

  functional verification products in this group which include the incisive tm functional verification platform are used to verify that the high level logical specification of an ic design is correct the technology acquired from verisity has been incorporated into the incisive functional verification platform 

  digital ic design products in this group which include the encounter tm digital ic design platform are used to accurately convert the highlevel logical specification of a digital integrated circuit into a detailed physical blueprint and then detailed design information showing how the integrated circuit will be physically implemented this data is used for creation of the photomasks used in chip manufacture 

  custom ic design our custom design products which include the virtuoso ® custom design platform are used for integrated circuits that must be designed at the transistor level including analog radio frequency memories high performance digital blocks and standard cell libraries detailed design information showing how the integrated circuit will be physically implemented is used for creation of the photomasks used in chip manufacture 

  design for manufacturing included in this product group are our physical verification and analysis products these products are used to analyze and verify that the physical blueprint of the integrated circuit has been constructed correctly and can be manufactured successfully 

  system interconnect this product group consists of our pcb and ic package design products including the allegro ® system interconnect design platform which enables consistent codesign of integrated circuits ic packages and pcbs 

35 revenue by year 

  the table below shows our revenue for the years ended 2005 2004 and 2003 and the percentage change in revenue between those years 

   2005 compared to 2004 

  product revenue was higher in 2005 as compared to 2004 primarily because of increased revenue from licenses for digital ic design functional verification and custom ic products services revenue was lower in 2005 as compared to 2004 due to our reduced capacity to satisfy demand for our design services after having implemented certain restructuring activities 

  2004 compared to 2003 

  product revenue was higher in 2004 as compared to 2003 primarily because of increased revenue from licenses for digital ic and system interconnect products and sales of certain intellectual property services revenue increased in 2004 due to an increase in customer spending for design and methodology services as the electronics industry experienced some recovery from the economic downturn of 2002 and 2003 

revenue by product group 

  the following table shows for 2005 2004 and 2003 the percentage of product and related maintenance revenue contributed by each of our five product groups and services and other 

   revenue generated by products acquired with verisity is included in the functional verification product group 

  during 2004 we recognized 110 million of revenue from the sale of intellectual property or ip this sale of ip is included in services and other in the preceding table and in product revenue in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations 

36 revenue by geography 

 revenue by geography as a percent of total revenue 

   both our domestic and international businesses have been affected by the revenue trends discussed above in this section entitled “results of operations” the rate of revenue change varies geographically primarily due to differences in the timing and size of term licenses in those regions 

  changes in foreign currency exchange rates caused our revenue to decrease by 57 million in 2005 as compared to 2004 and to increase by 160 million in 2004 as compared to 2003 primarily due to fluctuations of the japanese yen in relation to the united states dollar additional information about revenue and other financial information by geography can be found in note 21 to our consolidated financial statements 

cost of revenue 

 cost of revenue as a percent of related revenue 

   cost of product includes costs associated with the sale or lease of our hardware and licensing of our software products cost of product primarily includes the cost of employee salaries and benefits amortization 

37 of intangible assets directly related to cadence products the cost of technical documentation and royalties payable to thirdparty vendors cost of product associated with our hardware products also includes materials assembly labor and overhead these additional manufacturing costs make our cost of hardware product higher as a percentage of revenue than our cost of software product 

  a summary of cost of product is as follows 

   2005 compared to 2004 

  cost of product decreased 24 million in 2005 as compared to 2004 primarily due to a decrease of 135 million in the cost of hardware products sold as a result of sales of products with lower costs partially offset by a 66 million increase in amortization of intangibles a 16 million increase in royalty expenses and an increase in other individually insignificant items 

  cost of product in the future will depend primarily upon the actual mix of hardware and software product sales in any given period and the degree to which we license and incorporate thirdparty technology in our products licensed or sold in any given period 

  cost of services primarily includes employee salary and benefit costs costs to maintain the infrastructure necessary to manage a services organization and provisions for contract losses if any cost of services decreased 07 million in 2005 as compared to 2004 primarily due to a 15 million decrease in other operating expenses partially offset by a 09 million increase in salary and benefit costs 

  cost of maintenance includes the cost of customer services such as hotline and onsite support certain employees and documentation of maintenance updates cost of maintenance increased 58 million in 2005 as compared to 2004 due to a 31 million increase in amortization of intangible assets and a 22 million increase in salary and benefit costs the remaining increase in cost of maintenance is due to other individually insignificant items 

  2004 compared to 2003 

  cost of product increased 150 million in 2004 as compared to 2003 primarily due to an increase of 180 million in cost of goods sold for our hardware business resulting from increased sales of our hardware products and an increase of 50 million in amortization of intangible assets partially offset by a 44 million decrease in royalty expenses and a 36 million decrease in amortized software costs 

  cost of services decreased 22 million in 2004 as compared to 2003 primarily due to a decrease in salary and benefit costs resulting from decreases in employees in our services business services gross margin as a percentage of services revenue increased during 2004 as compared to 2003 due to increased services revenues and decreased cost of services 

  cost of maintenance decreased 35 million in 2004 as compared to 2003 due to a 23 million decrease in salary and benefit costs and a 12 million decrease in information technology facilities and general operating expenses 

38 operating expenses 

 operating expenses as a percent of total revenue 

 operating expense summary 

  with the adoption of sfas no 123r in the first quarter of 2006 we expect our operating expenses to increase due to the expensing of the fair value of awards granted under our equity compensation plans 

  2005 compared to 2004 

  operating expenses increased 811 million during 2005 as compared to 2004 primarily due to a 573 million increase in employee salary and benefit costs primarily due to our acquisition of verisity and increased bonus and commission costs and an 86 million increase in losses associated with the sale of installment contract receivables the increase in operating expenses was also due to executive severance costs and other individually insignificant items these increases were partially offset by our restructuring activities as discussed below 

  2004 compared to 2003 

  operating expenses increased 83 million during 2004 as compared to 2003 primarily due to a 318 million increase in employee salary and benefit and related costs including bonuses earned in 2004 that had not been earned in 2003 this increase was partially offset by a 132 million decrease in depreciation and amortization expense a 74 million decrease in outside services and a 72 million decrease in commission payments to innotech as a result of our acquisition from innotech in 2003 of distribution rights to certain of its customers 

  foreign currency exchange rates increased operating expenses by 109 million in 2004 as compared to 2003 primarily due to the strengthening of the european union euro british pound and japanese yen in relation to the united states dollar 

marketing and sales 

  2005 compared to 2004 

  marketing and sales expenses increased 301 million during 2005 as compared to 2004 primarily due to a 279 million increase in employee salary commission and benefit costs the remaining increase in marketing and sales expense was due to other individually insignificant items partially offset by a 19 million decrease in outside marketing program costs 

39   2004 compared to 2003 

  marketing and sales expenses decreased 07 million during 2004 as compared to 2003 primarily due to a 72 million decrease in commission payments to innotech as a result of our acquisition from innotech of distribution rights to certain of its customers and a 31 million reduction in depreciation related to prior restructuring activities this decrease was partially offset by a 77 million increase in employee salary and benefit and related costs and a 22 million increase in marketing program costs 

research and development 

  2005 compared to 2004 

  research and development expense increased 188 million in 2005 as compared to 2004 primarily due to a 224 million increase in employee salary and benefit costs partially offset by a 39 million decrease in depreciation expense the increase in salary and benefit costs resulted primarily from the acquisition of verisity and increased staffing to support product development 

  2004 compared to 2003 

  research and development expense increased 112 million during 2004 as compared to 2003 primarily due to a 214 million increase in employee salary and benefit and related costs resulting from an increase in employees due to business acquisitions and increased staffing to support product development this increase was partially offset by a 74 million decrease in expenses related to our use of outside services and a 32 million decrease in costs associated with outsourced research and development projects 

general and administrative 

  2005 compared to 2004 

  general and administrative expense increased 322 million in 2005 as compared to 2004 primarily due to an 86 million increase in losses on the sale of installment contract receivables a 71 million increase in executive severance costs a 65 million increase in employee salary and benefit costs and a 52 million increase in legal and consulting services the remaining increase in general and administrative expense is due to other individually insignificant items partially offset by a 12 million decrease in professional fees related to our annual audit and sarbanesoxley section 404 compliance 

  2004 compared to 2003 

  general and administrative expense decreased 22 million in 2004 as compared to 2003 primarily due to a 30 million decrease in losses on the sale of installment contract receivables a 26 million decrease in legal expense a 24 million decrease in bad debt expense and a 13 million decrease in insurance expense partially offset by a 45 million increase in employee salary benefit and related costs and a 26 million increase in professional fees related to our annual audit and sarbanesoxley section 404 compliance 

amortization of acquired intangibles 

   we expect amortization of acquired intangibles to significantly decrease in 2006 due to the completed amortization of certain existing intangible assets during 2005 

  2005 compared to 2004 

  amortization of acquired intangibles decreased 79 million in 2005 as compared to 2004 primarily due to a 210 million decrease in the amortization of acquired intangibles reflecting the full amortization of 

40 intangible assets from prior year acquisitions partially offset by increases of 131 million in amortization of acquired intangibles in connection with acquisitions completed in 2005 and 2004 

  2004 compared to 2003 

  amortization of acquired intangibles decreased 69 million in 2004 as compared to 2003 primarily due to an 114 million decrease in the amortization of acquired intangibles reflecting the full amortization of intangible assets from prior year acquisitions partially offset by increases of 56 million in amortization of acquired intangibles in connection with acquisitions completed in 2004 and 2003 

deferred compensation 

   we amortize deferred stock compensation related to fixed awards using the straightline method over the period that the stock options and restricted stock vest we recognize stock compensation expense related to variable awards using an accelerated method over the period that the stock options and restricted stock are earned 

  with the adoption of sfas no 123r in the first quarter of 2006 we expect deferred compensation to decrease as the related equity compensation expense will be reflected throughout our other operating expenses 

  2005 compared to 2004 

  deferred compensation increased 189 million in 2005 as compared to 2004 due to a 104 million increase in deferred compensation related to our nonqualified deferred compensation plans and a 91 million increase in deferred stock compensation primarily related to incentive stock grants 

  2004 compared to 2003 

  deferred stock compensation decreased 213 million in 2004 as compared to 2003 due to a 246 million decrease in deferred stock compensation primarily related to our previously completed acquisitions and an 116 million decrease in deferred compensation expense related to our nonqualified deferred compensation plans this decrease was partially offset by a 149 million increase in deferred stock compensation primarily related to incentive stock grants 

restructuring and other charges 

  we have initiated a separate plan of restructuring in each year since 2001 in an effort to reduce operating expenses and improve operating margins and cash flows 

  the restructuring plans initiated each year from 2001 through 2004 or the 2001 restructuring 2002 restructuring 2003 restructuring and 2004 restructuring respectively were intended to decrease costs through workforce reductions and facility and resource consolidation in order to improve our cost structure the 2001 and 2002 restructurings primarily related to our design services business and certain other business or infrastructure groups throughout the world the 2003 and 2004 restructurings were targeted at reducing costs throughout the company 

  during 2005 we implemented a new plan of restructuring or the 2005 restructuring in an effort to decrease costs by reducing workforce and consolidating facilities throughout the company 

  during 2005 in conjunction with the workforce reduction involving our european design services business we completed a saleleaseback transaction involving land and a building in livingston scotland proceeds from the sale were 336 million and the total gain on the sale was 36 million we have agreed to lease back a portion of the facility for the next two years and another portion for ten years with an option to 

41 terminate the ten year lease at five years we have deferred the gain on the sale and will recognize the gain ratably over the maximum remaining lease term of ten years 

  a summary of restructuring and other charges by plan of restructuring for fiscal years 2005 2004 and 2003 is as follows 

   frequently asset impairments are based on significant estimates and assumptions particularly regarding remaining useful life and utilization rates we may incur other charges in the future if management determines that the useful life or utilization of certain longlived assets has been reduced 

  facility closure and office space reduction costs include payments required under leases less any applicable estimated sublease income after the properties were abandoned lease buyout costs and other contractual charges to determine the lease loss which is the loss after our cost recovery efforts from subleasing all or part of a building certain assumptions were made related to the time period over which the relevant building would remain vacant and sublease terms including sublease rates and contractual common area charges 

  as of december 31 2005 our estimate of the accrued lease loss related to all worldwide restructuring activities initiated since 2001 was 348 million this amount will be adjusted in the future based upon changes in the assumptions used to estimate the lease loss the lease loss could range as high as 388 million if sublease rental rates decrease in applicable markets or if it takes longer than currently expected to find a suitable tenant to sublease the facilities since 2001 we have recorded facilities consolidation charges under the 2001 through 2005 restructurings of 977 million related to reducing space in or the closing of 49 sites of which 28 have been vacated and 21 have been downsized we expect to pay all of the facilitiesrelated restructuring liabilities for all our restructuring plans prior to 2016 

  because the restructuring charges and related benefits are derived from management’s estimates made during the formulation of the restructurings based on thencurrently available information our restructuring activities may not achieve the benefits anticipated on the timetable or at the level contemplated demand for our products and services and ultimately our future financial performance is difficult to predict with any 

42 degree of certainty accordingly additional actions including further restructuring of our operations may be required in the future 

  the following is further discussion of the activity under each restructuring plan 

  2005 restructuring  — during the year ended december 31 2005 we reduced our workforce by approximately 300 employees including approximately 65 employees in our european design services business and consolidated facilities and resources throughout the company costs resulting from the 2005 restructuring included severance payments severancerelated benefits outplacement services lease costs associated with facilities vacated and downsized and charges for assets writtenoff as a result of the restructuring severance and benefits expenses associated with the 2005 restructuring were approximately 208 million 

  all terminations and termination benefits associated with the workforce reductions under the 2005 restructuring were communicated to the affected employees prior to december 31 2005 with substantially all termination benefits paid prior to december 31 2005 the remaining termination benefits are expected to be paid by april 1 2006 

  assetrelated and other charges of 24 million recorded in the year ended december 31 2005 are comprised of 15 million of expenses from the restructuring activities primarily related to the writeoff of leasehold improvements for facilities vacated and downsized and 09 million of other charges related to the disposal of other assets not associated with our restructuring activities 

  facilitiesrelated expenses of 24 million for the year ended december 31 2005 are comprised of 18 million of expenses for facilities vacated or consolidated and 06 million related to changes in lease loss estimates for vacated and downsized facilities facilitiesrelated expenses include payments required under leases net of estimated sublease income lease buyout costs and other contractual charges 

  we expect total ongoing annual savings of approximately 383 million related to the actions of the 2005 restructuring we also expect to incur an additional 10 million to 20 million of future costs in connection with the 2005 restructuring primarily for facilitiesrelated charges which will be expensed as incurred the actual amount of additional costs incurred could vary depending on changes in market conditions and the timing of these restructuring activities 

  2004 restructuring  — we recorded a net credit of 03 million during 2005 which relates to reversing the portion of the severance and other benefits accrual in excess of the remaining expected obligation 

  2003 restructuring  — during 2005 we recorded additional expense of 48 million related primarily to changes in estimated sublease income from vacated and downsized facilities cadence also paid approximately 35 million of fees related to headcount reductions at a foreign facility the liability associated with this payment was recorded prior to the year ended december 31 2005 

  we expect to incur an additional 30 million to 50 million of future costs in connection with the 2003 restructuring primarily for facilitiesrelated charges which will be expensed as incurred the actual amount of additional costs incurred could vary depending on changes in market conditions and the timing of these restructuring activities 

  2002 restructuring  — during 2005 we recorded a net credit of 04 million related to changes in lease loss estimates for facilities included in the 2002 restructuring 

  2001 restructuring  — during 2005 we recorded additional expense of 57 million related to a change in the lease loss estimate for a facility included in the 2001 restructuring 

writeoff of acquired inprocess research and development 

  upon consummation of an acquisition we immediately charge to expense any acquired inprocess research and development that has not yet reached technological feasibility and has no alternative future use the value assigned to acquired inprocess research and development is determined by identifying research projects in areas for which technological feasibility has not been established the values are determined by 

43 estimating costs to develop the acquired inprocess research and development into commercially viable products estimating the resulting net cash flows from such projects and discounting the net cash flows back to their present value the discount rates utilized include a factor that reflects the uncertainty surrounding successful development of the acquired inprocess research and development 

  described below are the writeoffs of acquired inprocess research and development charges in 2005 2004 and 2003 

   described below is a summary of inprocess research and development acquired during 2005 2004 and 2003 as of december 31 2005 

 interest expense 

   we expect interest expense to increase during 2006 due to the 1600 million term loan entered into by our irish subsidiary castlewilder in december 2005 

  2005 compared to 2004 

  interest expense decreased 08 million in 2005 as compared to 2004 primarily due to a decrease of 06 million in imputed interest on acquisitionrelated payments which occur over time the remaining decrease of 02 million is due to other individually insignificant items 

44   2004 compared to 2003 

  interest expense increased 12 million in 2004 as compared to 2003 primarily due to an increase of 18 million in amortization expense related to the costs associated with the issuance of our notes in august 2003 an increase of 13 million in imputed interest on acquisitionrelated payments which occur over time partially offset by a decrease of 19 million in interest expense related to our 2002 credit facilities that were terminated in 2003 after the issuance of the notes 

other income expense net 

  other income expense net for the years ended 2005 2004 and 2003 is as follows 

 provision for income taxes 

  the provision for income taxes and the effective tax rates for 2005 2004 and 2003 are as follows 

   2005 compared to 2004 

  the effective tax rate in 2005 increased from that in 2004 primarily due to 301 million of federal state and foreign income taxes incurred upon our repatriation of 5000 million of certain foreign earnings under the american jobs creation act or ajca and an increase in foreign income tax expense from operations 

  2004 compared to 2003 

  the income before provision for income taxes resulted in a provision for income taxes in 2004 compared to a benefit for income taxes in 2003 the 2004 provision for income taxes has a greater benefit from foreign income that is taxed at a lower rate than the united states federal statutory rate when compared to 2003 

  outlook for 2006 

  we are currently projecting the effective income tax rate for 2006 to be approximately 40 the decrease in the effective income tax rate as compared to 2005 is primarily due to the nonrecurring income taxes related to the 2005 repatriation of certain foreign earnings with the adoption of sfas no 123r in the first quarter of 2006 we may have additional volatility in our effective income tax rate due to certain stockbased compensation for which we are not allowed to anticipate a tax deduction the tax deduction will be recognized in the period of the taxable event 

45   as of december 31 2005 we had total net deferred tax assets of approximately 1483 million realization of the deferred tax assets will depend on generating sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character prior to the expiration of certain net operating loss capital loss and tax credit carryforwards although realization is not assured we believe it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets will be realized the amount of the net deferred tax assets however could be reduced or increased in the near term if actual facts including the estimate of future taxable income differ from those estimated 

  during the fourth quarter of 2005 we completed our evaluation of the repatriation provisions of the ajca which created a temporary one year incentive for united states corporations to repatriate accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries by providing an 85 dividends received deduction for certain qualifying dividends we made the determination to repatriate 500 million of certain foreign earnings which were previously considered to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the united states we will invest these earnings in the united states pursuant to the ajca guidelines we completed the repatriation and we recorded an income tax expense of 301 million associated with the repatriation during the fourth quarter of 2005 in the future we intend to indefinitely reinvest our foreign earnings outside of the united states 

  the irs and other tax authorities regularly examine our income tax returns in november 2003 the irs completed its field examination of our federal income tax returns for the tax years 1997 through 1999 and issued a revenue agent’s report or the rar in which the irs proposes to assess an aggregate tax deficiency for the threeyear period of approximately 1430 million plus interest which interest will accrue until the matter is resolved this interest is compounded daily at rates published by the irs which rates are adjusted quarterly and have been between four and nine percent since 1997 the rar is not a final statutory notice of deficiency and we have protested certain of the proposed adjustments with the appeals office of the irs where the matter is presently being considered the most significant of the disputed adjustments relates to transfer pricing arrangements that we have with a foreign subsidiary we believe that the proposed irs adjustments are inconsistent with applicable tax laws and that we have meritorious defenses to the proposed adjustments the irs may also make similar claims for years subsequent to 1999 

  the irs is currently examining our federal income tax returns for the tax years 2000 through 2002 and may challenge the tax reported on these tax returns 

  significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes we have assessed the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from tax examinations including the current irs examination and the irs rar for tax years 1997 through 1999 we provide for tax liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets unless we consider it probable that additional taxes will not be due however the ultimate outcome of tax examinations cannot be predicted with certainty including the total amount payable or the timing of any such payments upon resolution of these issues in addition we cannot be certain that such amount will not be materially different than that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals should the irs or other tax authorities assess additional taxes as a result of a current or a future examination we may be required to record charges to operations in future periods that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows in the period or periods recorded 

disclosures about market risk 

interest rate risk 

  our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our shortterm investment portfolio and the term loan entered into by our irish subsidiary castlewilder while we are exposed to interest rate fluctuations in many of the world’s leading industrialized countries our interest income and expense is most sensitive to fluctuations in the general level of united states interest rates in this regard changes in united states interest rates affect the interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents shortterm and longterm investments and costs associated with foreign currency hedges and interest paid on the castlewilder term loan 

46   we invest in high quality credit issuers and by policy limit the amount of our credit exposure to any one issuer as part of our policy our first priority is to reduce the risk of principal loss consequently we seek to preserve our invested funds by limiting default risk market risk and reinvestment risk we mitigate default risk by investing in only high quality credit securities that we believe to have low credit risk and by positioning our portfolio to respond appropriately to a significant reduction in the credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor the shortterm interestbearing portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity 

  the table below presents the carrying value and related weighted average interest rates for our interestbearing instruments all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase are considered to be cash equivalents investments with maturities between three and 12 months are considered to be shortterm investments investments with maturities greater than 12 months are considered longterm investments the carrying value of our interestbearing instruments approximated fair value at december 31 2005 

   in connection with the castlewilder term loan we manage interest rate risk by having the option to choose between two interest rates i a base rate equal to the higher of the federal funds rate plus a spread of 050 or the “prime rate” publicly announced by bank of america na or ii a liborbased rate equal to libor plus a spread of 0625 the loan was initially a base rate loan that converted on december 22 2005 into a liborbased rate loan which accrued interest monthly at a rate of 4995 as of december 31 2005 we can change our interest rate election each interest period as defined in the loan agreement the margin with respect to the loan if the loan is a libor loan may be increased or decreased depending upon our consolidated leverage ratio 

foreign currency risk 

  our operations include transactions in foreign currencies and therefore we benefit from a weaker dollar and we are adversely affected by a stronger dollar relative to major currencies worldwide the primary effect of foreign currency transactions on our results of operations from a weakening united states dollar is an increase in revenue offset by a smaller increase in expenses conversely the primary effect of foreign currency transactions on our results of operations from a strengthening united states dollar is a reduction in revenue offset by a smaller reduction in expenses 

  we enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts with financial institutions to protect against currency exchange risks associated with existing assets and liabilities a foreign currency forward exchange contract acts as a hedge by increasing in value when underlying assets decrease in value or underlying liabilities increase in value due to changes in foreign exchange rates conversely a foreign currency forward exchange contract decreases in value when underlying assets increase in value or underlying liabilities decrease in value due to changes in foreign exchange rates these forward contracts are not designated as accounting hedges under sfas no 133 “accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities” and therefore the unrealized gains and losses are recognized in other income expense net in advance of the actual foreign currency cash flows with the fair value of these forward contracts being recorded as accrued liabilities or other assets 

47   our policy governing hedges of foreign currency risk does not allow us to use forward contracts for trading purposes our forward contracts generally have maturities of 180 days or less the effectiveness of our hedging program depends on our ability to estimate future asset and liability exposures we enter into currency forward exchange contracts based on estimated future asset and liability exposures recognized gains and losses with respect to our current hedging activities will ultimately depend on how accurately we are able to match the amount of currency forward exchange contracts with actual underlying asset and liability exposures 

  the table below provides information as of december 31 2005 about our forward foreign currency contracts the information is provided in united states dollar equivalent amounts the table presents the notional amounts at contract exchange rates and the weighted average contractual foreign currency exchange rates expressed as units of the foreign currency per united states dollar which in some cases may not be the market convention for quoting a particular currency all of these forward contracts mature prior to march 17 2006 

   while we actively monitor our foreign currency risks there can be no assurance that our foreign currency hedging activities will substantially offset the impact of fluctuations in currency exchange rates on our results of operations cash flows and financial position 

equity price risk 

  in august 2003 we issued 4200 million principal amount of the notes to two initial purchasers in a private offering for resale to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to sec rule 144a for which we received net proceeds of approximately 4064 million after transaction fees of approximately 136 million the notes are convertible into our common stock initially at a conversion price of 1565 per share which would result in an aggregate of 268 million shares issued upon conversion subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events we may redeem for cash all or any part of the notes on or after august 15 2008 for 10000 of the principal amount the holders may require us to repurchase for cash all or any portion of their notes on august 15 2008 for 10025 of the principal amount on august 15 2013 for 10000 of the principal amount or on august 15 2018 for 10000 of the principal amount the notes do not contain restrictive financial covenants 

  each 1000 of principal of the notes will initially be convertible into 638790 shares of our common stock subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events holders of the notes may convert their notes prior to maturity only if 1 the price of our common stock reaches 2269 during certain periods of time specified in the notes 2 specified corporate transactions occur 3 the notes have been called for redemption or 4 the trading price of the notes falls below a certain threshold 

  in addition in the event of a significant change in our corporate ownership or structure the holders may require us to repurchase all or any portion of their notes for 10000 of the principal amount 

48   concurrently with the issuance of the notes we entered into convertible notes hedge transactions with jp morgan chase bank whereby we have options to purchase up to 268 million shares of our common stock at a price of 1565 per share these options expire on august 15 2008 and must be settled in net shares the cost of the convertible notes hedge transactions to us was approximately 1346 million as of december 31 2005 the estimated fair value of the options acquired in the convertible notes hedge transactions was 1308 million 

  in addition we sold to jp morgan chase bank warrants to purchase up to 268 million shares of our common stock at a price of 2308 per share the warrants expire on various dates from february 2008 through may 2008 and must be settled in net shares we received approximately 564 million in cash proceeds for the sales of these warrants as of december 31 2005 the estimated fair value of the sold warrants was 296 million 

  for additional discussion of the notes see “liquidity and capital resources” below 

  we have a portfolio of equity investments that includes marketable equity securities and nonmarketable equity securities our equity investments primarily are made in connection with our strategic investment program under our strategic investment program from time to time we make cash investments in companies with technologies that are potentially strategically important to us 

  the fair value of our portfolio of availableforsale marketable equity securities which are included in shortterm investments in the accompanying consolidated financial statements was 330 million as of december 31 2005 and 359 million as of january 1 2005 while we actively monitor these investments we do not currently engage in any hedging activities to reduce or eliminate equity price risk with respect to these equity investments accordingly we could lose all or part of our investment portfolio of marketable equity securities if there is an adverse change in the market prices of the companies we invest in 

  our investments in nonmarketable equity securities would be negatively affected by an adverse change in equity market prices although the impact cannot be directly quantified such a change or any negative change in the financial performance or prospects of the companies whose nonmarketable securities we own would harm the ability of these companies to raise additional capital and the likelihood of our being able to realize any gains or return of our investments through liquidity events such as initial public offerings acquisitions and private sales these types of investments involve a high degree of risk and there can be no assurance that any company we invest in will grow or will be successful accordingly we could lose all or part of our investment 

  our investments in nonmarketable equity securities had a carrying amount of 379 million as of december 31 2005 and 457 million as of january 1 2005 if we determine that an otherthantemporary decline in fair value exists for a nonmarketable equity security we write down the investment to its fair value and record the related writedown as an investment loss in our consolidated statements of operations

cash flows from operating activities 

  cash flows from operating activities are provided by net income adjusted for certain noncash charges as well as changes in the balance of certain assets and liabilities our cash flows from operating activities are significantly influenced by the payment terms set forth in our license agreements and by sales of receivables 

  we have entered into agreements whereby we may transfer accounts receivable to certain financing institutions on a nonrecourse basis these transfers are recorded as sales and accounted for in accordance with sfas no 140 “accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities” during 2005 we transferred accounts receivable totaling 1921 million which approximated fair value to financing institutions on a nonrecourse basis as compared to 301 million in 2004 and 874 million in 2003 

  provision for sales returns is accounted for as a reduction of revenue provision for sales returns decreased by 05 million in 2005 as compared to 2004 and decreased 70 million in 2004 as compared to 2003 

  2005 compared to 2004

52 the matter is resolved the rar is not a final statutory notice of deficiency and we have filed a protest with the irs to certain of the proposed adjustments we are challenging these proposed adjustments vigorously while we are protesting certain of the proposed adjustments we cannot predict with certainty the ultimate outcome of the tax examination including the amount payable or timing of such payments which may materially impact our cash flows in the period or periods resolved the irs may also make similar claims for tax returns filed for years subsequent to 1999

  during 2005 we recorded restructuring and other charges of 353 million and made 335 million of cash payments related to all of our restructuring activities we expect to incur an additional 40 million to 70 million of future costs in connection with our restructuring activities in subsequent periods primarily for facilitiesrelated charges in connection with the 2003 and 2005 restructurings which amounts will be expensed as incurred 

  in december 2005 our irish subsidiary castlewilder entered into a syndicated term facility agreement or credit agreement with banc of america securities llc as lead arranger bank of america na as administrative agent the credit agreement provides for a threeyear 160 million unsecured term loan with the consent of all of the lenders we may at the end of the second year of the loan extend the maturity date to december 31 2009 castlewilder’s obligations under the credit agreement are guaranteed by us and cadence technology limited a whollyowned subsidiary of castlewilder our guaranty contains certain financial covenants that must be maintained by us on a consolidated basis as well as limitations on our ability to incur additional indebtedness and liens make investments dispose of assets pay dividends or other distributions engage in certain corporate transactions and certain other activities

  in addition we sold warrants to purchase up to 268 million shares of our common stock at a price of 2308 per share the warrants expire on various dates from february 2008 through may 2008 and must be settled in net shares we received approximately 564 million in cash proceeds for the sales of these warrants as of december 31 2005 the estimated fair value of the sold warrants was 296 million 

contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements 

  a summary of our contractual obligations as of december 31 2005 is as follows 

   the primary components of other longterm contractual obligations of 2699 million related to indemnity holdbacks from acquisitions income tax liabilities and deferred income tax liabilities 

  in connection with our acquisitions completed prior to december 31 2005 we may be obligated to pay up to an aggregate of 270 million in cash during the next 12 months and an additional 70 million in cash during the three years following the next 12 months if certain performance goals related to one or more of the following are achieved in full revenue bookings product proliferation product development and employee retention 

  we expect that current cash and shortterm investment balances and cash flows that are generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital and other capital requirements for at least the next 12 months 

  as of december 31 2005 we did not have any significant offbalance sheet arrangements as defined in item 303a4ii of sec regulation sk 

new accounting standards 

  in june 2005 the fasb issued sfas no 154 “accounting changes and error corrections” which changes the requirements for the accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle previously most voluntary changes in accounting principles required recognition via a cumulative effect adjustment within net income of the period of the change sfas no 154 requires retrospective application to prior periods’ financial statements unless it is impracticable to determine either the periodspecific effects or the cumulative effect of the change sfas no 154 is effective for accounting changes made in fiscal years 

54 beginning after december 15 2005 however sfas no 154 does not change the transition provisions of any existing accounting pronouncements 

  in march 2005 the fasb published fasb interpretation or fin no 47 “accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations” which clarifies that the term “conditional asset retirement obligation” as used in sfas no 143 “accounting for asset retirement obligations” refers to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity the uncertainty about the timing and or method of settlement of a conditional asset retirement obligation should be factored into the measurement of the liability when sufficient information exists the interpretation also clarifies when an entity would have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation this interpretation was adopted effective december 31 2005 the adoption of this interpretation did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  in december 2004 the fasb issued sfas no 123r “sharebased payments” which eliminates the ability to account for sharebased compensation transactions using the intrinsic value method under apb no 25 and requires the measurement of all sharebased payments to employees including grants of employee stock options using a fairvaluebased method and the recording of such expense in our consolidated statements of operations we are required to adopt sfas no 123r in our first quarter of fiscal 2006 sfas no 123r will result in the recognition of substantial compensation expense relating to our employee stock options and employee stock purchase plans as noted in note 2 of our consolidated financial statements we generally do not recognize any compensation expense related to stock option grants issued under our stock option plans or related to the discounts provided under our employee stock purchase plans under the new rules we will be required to adopt a fairvaluebased method for measuring the compensation expense related to employee stock awards the resulting additional compensation expense will have a material adverse effect on our reported results of operations we will recognize stockbased compensation expense on all awards on a straightline basis over the requisite service period using the modified prospective method in january 2005 the sec issued sab no 107 which provides supplemental implementation guidance for sfas no 123r 

  in december 2004 the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 153 “exchanges of nonmonetary asset” an amendment of apb no 29 sfas no 153 addresses the measurement of exchanges of nonmonetary assets and redefines the scope of transactions that should be measured based on the fair value of the assets exchanged sfas no 153 is effective for us for nonmonetary asset exchanges beginning in the first quarter of 2006 the adoption of sfas no 153 is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows

 item 9a controls and procedures tableend evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

  we carried out an evaluation required by rule 13a15 of the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended or the exchange act under the supervision and with the participation of our management including the chief executive officer or ceo and the chief financial officer or cfo of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rules 13a15e and 15d15e under the exchange act as of december 31 2005 

  the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures included a review of our processes and implementation and the effect on the information generated for use in this annual report on form 10k in the course of this evaluation we sought to identify any significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in our disclosure controls and procedures to determine whether we had identified any acts of fraud involving personnel who have a significant role in our disclosure controls and procedures and to confirm that any necessary corrective action including process improvements was taken this type of evaluation is done every fiscal quarter so that our conclusions concerning the effectiveness of these controls can be reported in our periodic reports filed with the sec the overall goals of these evaluation activities are to monitor our disclosure controls and procedures and to make modifications as necessary we intend to maintain these disclosure controls and procedures modifying them as circumstances warrant 

  based on their evaluation as of december 31 2005 our ceo and cfo have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by us in our reports filed or submitted under the exchange act i is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the sec’s rules and forms and ii is accumulated and communicated to our management including the ceo and cfo as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure 

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

  there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended december 31 2005 that materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting 

inherent limitations on effectiveness of controls 

  our management including our ceo and cfo does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all error and all fraud a control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met further the design of a control system must 

56 reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within cadence have been detected

  we license electronic design automation or eda software sell or lease eda hardware technology and intellectual property and provide design and methodology services throughout the world to help manage and accelerate electronic product development processes our broad range of products and services are used by electronics companies to design and develop complex integrated circuits or ics ic packages and printed circuit boards or pcbs and commercial electronic systems we have approximately 4900 employees in approximately 60 sales offices design centers and research facilities located around the world 

  we were formed as a delaware corporation in april 1987 our headquarters are located at 2655 seely avenue san jose california 95134 our telephone number is 408 9431234 our website can be accessed at wwwcadencecom  we make available free of charge copies of our sec filings and submissions on the investor relations page of our website at wwwcadencecom as soon as practicable after electronically filing or furnishing such documents with the sec our corporate governance guidelines code of business conduct and the charters of the audit committee compensation committee and corporate governance and nominating committee of our board of directors are also posted on the investor relations page of our website at wwwcadencecom  stockholders may also request copies of these documents by writing to our corporate secretary at the address above 

factors driving the electronic design automation industry 

  during the last decade the worldwide communications business productivity and consumer electronics markets accounted for much of the growth in the electronics industry everdecreasing silicon manufacturing process geometries coupled with the move to 300 millimeter wafer production are causing ic unit cost decreases volume increases and greater complexity for providers of electronics devices at the same time the development of ics with greater functionality complicates effective integration of components into complete electronic systems these market and technology forces pose major challenges for the global electronics design community and consequently create significant opportunities and challenges for eda product and services providers 

  from a design perspective many of today’s complex ics are systemonachip or soc devices soc design requires the implementation of an entire electronics subsystem on a single ic which is made possible 

1 by smaller feature sizes characteristic of the newest ic fabrication processes smaller feature sizes make it possible to put additional circuitry on a single segment of silicon or die socs typically include one or more processors microprocessors and digital signal processors a highperformance bus for onchip data communication numerous memory devices and peripherals custom digital circuitry custom analog circuitry and millions of lines of software code developed to run on the resulting device these complex devices offer benefits in terms of price performance power and size however they are extremely difficult to design successful soc design requires the convergence of the previously distinct domains of embedded software digital logic analog circuitry ic packaging and pcb design this convergence is changing the way designs for these devices are created 

  the migration to nanometer design poses major challenges for design teams nanometer design refers to the design of ics that will have feature sizes smaller than 180 nanometers or one hundred eighty billionths of a meter for reference the diameter of the period at the end of this sentence is approximately 400000 nanometers ic feature sizes for wires transistors and contacts decrease with each advance in the semiconductor manufacturing process each move to a smaller feature size eg decreasing from 130 nanometers to 90 nanometers and smaller requires introducing new capabilities throughout the entire design and manufacturing chain to account for physical effects that were inconsequential at larger geometries but now limit device yield performance reliability and the ability to function as intended for example at 130 nanometers signal integrity issues such as crosstalk between signal wires and voltage drop on power wires becomes critical at 90 nanometers device power leakage becomes a major factor in total power consumption the increased complexity electrical “noise” and power consumption due to leakage combine to increase the challenge to design teams in meeting chip performance specifications 

  these trends pose significant new challenges for electronics design teams specifically nanometer design requires designers to take into account many physical effects that were too small to affect the performance of larger circuit geometries soc design requires new approaches to managing complexity and its related risks the electronics industry addresses these challenges in a number of ways including the use of new eda products the upgrade of existing tools and design methodologies and offering the advantages of highly integrated fronttoback design solutions 

operating segments 

  during 2004 we combined our three reporting segments into one segment our chief operating decision maker is our president and chief executive officer or ceo our ceo reviews our consolidated results within only one segment 

products 

  our products are engineered to improve our customers’ design productivity and resulting design quality by providing the most comprehensive set of eda design technology in the industry product revenues include all fees earned from granting licenses to use our software and from sales and leases of our hardware products and exclude revenues derived from maintenance and services we offer customers three license types for our software perpetual term and subscription see “software licensing arrangements” below for additional discussion of our license types 

  product revenue represented 61 of our total revenue in 2004 59 in 2003 and 63 in 2002 

product strategy 

  with the addition of emerging nanometer design considerations to the already burgeoning set of traditional design tasks complex soc or ic design can no longer be accomplished using a collection of discrete design tools what previously consisted of sequential design activities must be merged and accomplished nearly simultaneously without timeconsuming data translation steps we combine our design technologies into “platforms” for four major design activities functional verification digital ic design custom ic design and system interconnect the four cadence design platforms are incisive tm functional verification encounter tm digital ic design virtuoso® custom design and allegro® system interconnect platforms in 

2 addition we augment these platform product offerings with a comprehensive set of design for manufacturing products that service both the digital and custom ic design flows these four platforms together with our design for manufacturing products comprise our primary product lines 

incisive functional verification platform 

  the incisive functional verification platform enables our customers to employ an efficient and unified methodology from design of the total system to design of particular ics to design of specific systems for all design domains compared to traditional simulation approaches the incisive platform provides faster fullchip verification throughout the entire design cycle which significantly reduces total verification time 

  the incisive platform overcomes fragmentation by unifying multiple verification techniques around a single engine it also provides support for open design and verification standards as well as analogmixedsignal verification in addition the incisive platform includes a comprehensive assertionbased verification or abv environment — unifying tools language intellectual property or ip debugging and coverage for increased verification productivity the incisive abv solution speeds verification of complex designs by creating an environment that helps users define assertions correctly enables early detection of bugs close to the source and monitors for completeness through assertion coverage the same platform delivers palladium® hardware incircuit emulation and simulation accelerationondemand transactionlevel support hardware description language analysis coverage debug and analysis and test generation not only is incisive designed so customers can adopt these technologies incrementally it can also deliver the speed and efficiency required to compress our customers’ overall verification time the quickcycles tm capability allows customers to access palladium simulation acceleration and emulation products on a payasyougo basis either on the customer site or remotely over a highspeed secure network connection 

encounter digital ic design platform 

  the encounter digital ic design platform enables our customers to implement all aspects of their digital nanometerscale designs it is based on a single user interface and unified inmemory data model and was specifically designed to facilitate the analysis and optimization of wiring throughout our customers’ design process it is comprised of the following core technologies 

   unlike traditional “frontendbackend” systems the encounter platform does not require customers to perform timeconsuming translations between common tasks such as placement power distribution routing and timingcrosstalk analysis the soc encounter tm gps system supports hierarchical designs with fullchip support for designs containing more than 50 million gates a gate is an electronic switch that allows or prevents the flow of current in a circuit nano encounter tm supports fullchip implementation for nonhierarchical chips and blocks of up to 10 million gates 

virtuoso custom design platform 

  the virtuoso custom design platform enables design teams to develop siliconaccurate analog custom digital radio frequency or rf and mixedsignal designs with the virtuoso platform designers are able to deliver siliconaccurate designs while addressing the growing number of physical effects in package power grid interconnect devices and substrate employing a “topdown” languagebased design 

3   delivering an advanced custom design methodology the virtuoso platform enables design predictability by ensuring that the circuit design representation will perform correctly in the final manufactured chip the virtuoso platform reduces design time by providing 

 design for manufacturing 

  the physical layout of each ic requires detailed analysis and optimization to ensure that the design can be manufactured in volume while performing as expected some of the cadence products that deliver dfm capabilities for nanometer soc design include 

 allegro system interconnect design platform 

  the cadence allegro system interconnect design platform enables design teams to design highperformance interconnect across the domains of ic package and pcb reducing cost and time to market the system interconnect — between inputoutput or io buffers and across ics packages and pcbs — can be optimized through the platform’s codesign methodology reducing both hardware costs and design cycles designers use the allegro platform’s constraintdriven methodology and advanced capabilities for design capture signal integrity and physical implementation the allegro codesign methodology works with our encounter and virtuoso platforms enabling effective design chain collaboration silicon designin kits speed time to market by allowing ic companies to shorten new device adoption time and allowing systems companies to accelerate pcb system design cycles 

  the system interconnect product group includes the allegro system interconnect platform and the orcad® product line of pcb design products that is engineered for individual or small design team productivity the orcad product line is marketed exclusively through a worldwide network of value added resellers 

verification and application specific programming or asp services 

  we offer verification and asp services through timetomarket engineering or ttme services our ttme team provides customers with consulting services project services andor complete turnkey services for verification acceleration and system emulation quickcycles allows customers to access palladium simulation 

4 acceleration and emulation products on a payasyougo basis either on the customer internet site or remotely over a highspeed secure network connection 

third party programs and initiatives 

  we recognize that certain of our customers may also use internallydeveloped design tools or design tools provided by other eda companies as well as ip available from multiple suppliers we support the integration of third party design products through our openaccess initiative and connections® and openchoice programs openaccess is a fullfeatured eda database that supports access and manipulation of its internal eda data via a fully documented and freely available programming interface this provides an open application program interface through which applications developed by our customers by their other eda vendors or by university research groups can all operate within a single database and with cadence platforms 

  we have contributed the openaccess database to the openaccess coalition which is operated by the silicon integration initiative an organization of eda electronic system and semiconductor industry leaders focused on improving productivity and reducing cost in creating and producing integrated silicon systems the connections program provides other eda companies with access to our products to ensure that our products work well with those third party tools over 130 eda providers are members of the connections program the openchoice program was instituted to enable interoperability and facilitate open collaboration with leading ip providers of library processor memory core and verification ip to build validate and deliver accurate models optimized for cadence design and verification solutions the program aims to ensure ip quality and provide cadence customers with access to optimized ip a key component of the openchoice program is to assist and support library providers in the integration of our design and verification products and model formats into customerowned tooling or cot library solutions 

  in addition we work with vendors of application specific integrated circuits or asics to ensure predictable and smooth handoff of design data from mutual customers to asic implementation these programs foster relationships throughout the silicon design chain with leading ip partners silicon manufacturers and library provider partners to support both asic and cot solutions for our customers they are integral to providing complete design chain solutions to ic and electronic systems designers who depend on coordinated offerings from multiple suppliers 

maintenance 

  we provide technical support to our customers to facilitate their use of our software and hardware products a high level of customer service and support is critical to the adoption and successful use of our products 

  we have a global customer support organization and specialized field application engineering teams located in each of our operating regions to provide assistance to customers where and when they need it 

  standard maintenance support includes three major components our sourcelink® online support portal which provides 24 hour access to realtime technical information on our products contact center support telephone email and web access to our support engineers and software updates periodic updates with regressiontested critical fixes and updated functionality available via cds or secure internet download 

  maintenance is offered to customers as an integral noncancelable component of our subscription license agreements or as a separate agreement subject to annual renewal for our term and perpetual license customers during the recent downturn in the electronics industry some customers facing constrained budgets elected not to renew their maintenance agreements with us 

  some of our customers have relocated or expanded the presence of their design teams away from their headquarters or historical locations to less expensive locations in emerging growth regions accordingly to provide the most responsive and effective support for our customers we expect to continue expanding the presence of our own support and application engineering teams in emerging growth regions around the world 

5   maintenance revenues represented 28 of our total revenue in 2004 29 in 2003 and 26 in 2002 maintenance revenue in 2005 will be predominately generated from backlog 

services 

  we offer a number of feebased services including education and engineering services related to ic design and methodology these services may be sold and performed in conjunction with the sale lease or license of our products or sold separately 

  services revenue represented 11 of our total revenue in 2004 12 in 2003 and 11 in 2002 

education services 

  our educational services include internet classroom and custom courses the content of which ranges from how to use the most recent features of our eda products to instruction in the latest ic design techniques 

engineering services 

  we offer engineering services and reusable design technologies to aid customers with the design of complex ics we focus our offerings primarily on soc devices including both asics and application specific standard parts and on analog and mixed signal ics the customers for these services primarily consist of semiconductor and systems companies developing products for the communications computing and consumer market segments we offer engineering capabilities to assist customers from product concept through volume manufacturing 

  we also make our design ip portfolio available to customers as part of our technology and services solutions these reusable design and methodology components enable us to more efficiently deliver our services and allow our customers to reduce the design complexity and time to market for the development of complex socs 

  in our design and methodology service practices we leverage our cumulative experience and knowledge of design practices across many customers and different design environments to improve our own service teams’ and our customers’ productivity we work with customers using outsourcing consultative and collaborative models depending on their projects and needs our virtual computeraided design or vcad model enables our engineering teams at one or more of our locations to virtually work “sidebyside” with our customers’ teams located elsewhere during the course of their design and engineering projects through a secure private network infrastructure 

  through collaboration with our customers we are able to design advanced ics gaining direct and early visibility to industry design issues that may not be addressed adequately by today’s eda solutions this enables us to accelerate the development of new software technology and products to meet the market’s current and future design requirements 

marketing and sales 

  we generally use a direct sales force consisting of sales people and applications engineers to market our products and provide maintenance and services to existing and prospective customers applications engineers provide technical presales as well as postsales support for software products due to the complexity of many of our eda products and the electronic design process in general the sales cycle is generally long requiring three to six months or more during the sales cycle our direct sales force generally provides technical presentations product demonstrations and support for onsite customer evaluation of our software we also use traditional marketing approaches to promote our products and services including advertising direct mail telemarketing trade shows public relations and the internet as eda products mature and become widely understood by our marketplace we selectively utilize value added resellers to broaden our reach and reduce cost of sales the orcad and some incisive products are primarily marketed through these channels 

6   internationally we market and support our products and services primarily through our subsidiaries until june 28 2003 we licensed most of our software products in japan through innotech corporation of which we were an approximately 15 stockholder as of january 1 2005 in june 2003 we purchased certain assets from innotech including distribution rights for certain customers in japan since june 2003 we directly license our software products to customers for which we acquired the distribution rights from innotech 

research and development 

  our investment in research and development was 3513 million in 2004 3401 million in 2003 and 3264 million in 2002 

  the primary areas of our research include soc design the design of silicon devices in the nanometer range highperformance ic package and pcb design architecturallevel design highperformance logic verification technology and hardwaresoftware codesign because the electronics industry combines rapid innovation with rapidly increasing design and manufacturing complexity we focus significant investment on enhancing our current products as well as creating new products and technologies 

  our future performance depends largely on our ability to maintain and enhance our current product lines to meet advancing semiconductor manufacturing capability develop or acquire new products from third parties maintain technological competitiveness and meet increasingly complex customer requirements in addition to research and development we maintain cadence laboratories an advanced research group responsible for exploring new directions and applications of our technologies migrating new technologies into our existing offerings and maintaining strong industry relationships 

manufacturing and distribution 

  our software production consists of configuring the customer’s order outsourcing the recording of the product electronically or on cdrom and producing customerunique access keys allowing customers to use licensed products software and documentation are generally made available to customers by secured electronic delivery user manuals and other documentation are generally available on cdrom but are occasionally supplied in hard copy format 

  cadence performs final assembly and test of its hardware verification acceleration and emulation products in san jose california subcontractors manufacture all major subassemblies including all individual printed circuit boards and custom ics and supply them to us for qualification and testing prior to their incorporation into the assembled product 

proprietary technology 

  our success depends in part upon our proprietary technology we generally rely on patents copyrights trademarks trade secret laws licenses and restrictive agreements to establish and protect our proprietary rights in technology and products many of our products include software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties we may have to seek new or renew existing licenses for this third party software and other intellectual property in the future as part of performing design services for customers our design services business licenses certain software and other intellectual property of third parties including that of our competitors 

competition 

  we compete in the eda market for products and maintenance primarily with three other significant companies synopsys inc mentor graphics corporation and magma design automation inc we also compete with numerous smaller eda companies with manufacturers of electronic devices that have developed or have the capability to develop their own eda products and with numerous electronics design and consulting companies we generally compete on the basis of product quality and features integration in a platform or compatibility with other tools price and payment terms and maintenance offerings 

7   our maintenance business flows directly from the products business the competitive issues associated with our maintenance revenue are substantially the same as those for our product revenue in that every maintenance contract is the direct result of a product contract and once we have entered into a product contract maintenance is generally purchased by the customer to ensure that the customer will receive access to bug fixes and service releases as and when they are made available and other continued support 

  certain competitive factors in the design services business as described herein differ from those of the products and maintenance businesses while we compete with other eda companies in the design services business we compete more with independent design service businesses these companies vary greatly in focus geographic location capability cost structure and pricing in addition manufacturers of electronic devices may be reluctant to purchase services from independent vendors such as cadence because they wish to promote their own internal design departments we compete with these companies by focusing on the design of complex analog and digital ics it is our strategy to use design services as a differentiator to further promote our products and maintenance businesses 

backlog 

  our backlog on january 1 2005 was approximately 17 billion as compared to 16 billion on january 3 2004 backlog consists of revenue to be recognized over multiple fiscal periods after january 1 2005 

   the substantial majority of our backlog is generated by our product and maintenance business as customer licenses generally include both product and maintenance components services do not account for a significant component of backlog we expect that maintenance revenue in 2005 will be predominately generated from backlog we have not historically experienced significant cancellations of our contracts with customers however we often reschedule the required completion dates of services contracts which at times defers revenue recognition under those contracts beyond the original expected completion date changes in customer license types or payment terms also can impact the timing of revenue recognition see “software licensing arrangements” for a discussion of product revenue recognized from backlog 

revenue seasonality 

  historically orders and revenue have been lowest in our first quarter and highest in our fourth quarter with a material decline between the fourth quarter of one year and the first quarter of the next year we expect the first quarter will remain our lowest quarter for orders and revenues orders and revenues in other quarters will vary based on the particular timing and type of licenses entered into with large customers 

employees 

  as of january 1 2005 we employed approximately 4900 individuals with approximately 2250 in sales services marketing support and manufacturing activities approximately 2150 in product development and approximately 500 in management administration and finance none of our employees is represented by a labor union and we have experienced no work stoppages we believe that our employee relations are good 

8 software licensing arrangements 

  we sell software using three license types subscription term and perpetual customers who prefer to license technology for a specified limited period of time will choose either a subscription or term license and customers who prefer to have the right to use the technology continuously without time restriction choose perpetual licenses customers who desire rights to remix in new technology during the life of the contract select a subscription license which allows customers limited access to unspecified new technology on a whenandifavailable basis as opposed to a term or perpetual license which does not include remix rights to new technology payment terms for subscription and term licenses generally provide for installments over the license period and payment terms for perpetual licenses generally are net 30 days 

  our revenue recognition depends on a number of contractspecific terms and conditions including the license type payment terms creditworthiness of the customer and other factors as more fully described under the heading “critical accounting estimates” under item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” revenue associated with subscription licenses is recognized over multiple periods over the license term whereas product revenue associated with term and perpetual licenses may be eligible for revenue recognition upon the effective date and delivery of the license assuming all other criteria for revenue recognition have been met 

  product revenue recognized from backlog comprised approximately 68 of total product revenue in 2004 60 in 2003 and 45 in 2002 our revenue and results of operations may fall short of expectations due to the actual mix of license types executed in any given period and due to other contractspecific terms and conditions as discussed above we are subject to greater credit risk on subscription and term licenses as compared to perpetual licenses due to the installment payment terms generally associated with those license types otherwise the particular risks to us of one license type versus another type do not vary considerably 

  from time to time we sell receivables from our licenses with installment payment terms on a nonrecourse or limitedrecourse basis to third party financing institutions

  we have offices located in china france germany india japan russia taiwan the united kingdom and other areas throughout the world these offices primarily provide sales research and development and operational support functions we consider customer sales and support requirements the availability of a skilled workforce costs and efficiencies among other relative benefits when determining what operations to locate internationally for additional information regarding our international operations see note 19 to our consolidated financial statements 

factors that may affect future results 

  our business faces many risks described below are what we believe to be the material risks that we face if any of the events or circumstances described in the following risks actually occurs our business financial condition or results of operations could suffer 

risks related to our business 

we are subject to the cyclical nature of the integrated circuit and electronics systems industries and any 

downturn may reduce our revenue 

  purchases of our products and services are dependent upon the commencement of new design projects by ic manufacturers and electronics systems companies the ic industry is cyclical and is characterized by constant and rapid technological change rapid product obsolescence and price erosion evolving standards short product life cycles and wide fluctuations in product supply and demand 

9   the ic and electronics systems industries have experienced significant downturns often connected with or in anticipation of maturing product cycles of both these industries’ and their customers’ products and a decline in general economic conditions these downturns have been characterized by diminished product demand production overcapacity high inventory levels and accelerated erosion of average selling prices 

  over the past several years ic manufacturers and electronics systems companies have experienced a downturn in demand and production which has resulted in reduced research and development spending by many of our customers many of these companies appear to have experienced a gradual recovery in the second half of 2003 and throughout 2004 but they have continued to spend cautiously any economic downturn in the industries we serve could harm our business operating results and financial condition 

our failure to respond quickly to technological developments could make our products uncompetitive 

and obsolete 

  the industries in which we compete experience rapid silicon technology developments changes in industry standards changes in customer requirements and frequent new product introductions and improvements currently the industries we serve are experiencing several revolutionary trends 

   if we are unable to respond quickly and successfully to these developments and the evolution of these changes we may lose our competitive position and our products or technologies may become uncompetitive or obsolete to compete successfully we must develop or acquire new products and improve our existing products and processes on a schedule that keeps pace with technological developments in our industries we must also be able to support a range of changing computer software hardware platforms and customer preferences we cannot guarantee that we will be successful in this effort 

10 we have experienced varied quarterly operating results and our operating results for any particular fiscal 

period are affected by the timing of significant orders for our software products fluctuations in 

customer preferences for license types and the timing of recognition of revenue under those license 

types 

  we have experienced and may continue to experience varied quarterly operating results in particular we have recently experienced quarterly net losses and we may experience net losses in future periods various factors affect our quarterly operating results and some of them are not within our control our quarterly operating results are affected by the timing of significant orders for our software products because a significant number of licenses for our software products are in excess of 50 million the failure to complete a license for one or more orders for our software products in a particular quarter could seriously harm our operating results for that quarter 

  our operating results are also affected by the mix of license types executed in any given period we license software using three different license types subscription term and perpetual product revenue associated with term and perpetual licenses is generally recognized at the beginning of the license period whereas product revenue associated with subscription licenses is recognized over multiple periods over the term of the license revenue may also be deferred under term and perpetual licenses until payments become due and payable from customers with nonlinear payment terms or as cash is collected from customers with lower credit ratings 

  we continue to observe increasing customer preference for our subscription licenses and requests for more flexible payment terms we expect revenue recognized from backlog to increase as a percentage of product revenue on an annual basis assuming that customers continue to prefer subscription licenses or continue to request more flexible payment terms both of which cause revenue to be recognized over time in addition revenue is impacted by the timing of license renewals the extent to which contracts contain flexible payment terms and the mix of license types ie perpetual term or subscription for existing customers which changes could have the effect of accelerating or delaying the recognition of revenue from the timing of recognition under the original contract 

  we plan operating expense levels primarily based on forecasted revenue levels these expenses and the impact of longterm commitments are relatively fixed in the short term a shortfall in revenue could lead to operating results below expectations because we may not be able to quickly reduce these fixed expenses in response to shortterm business changes 

  you should not view our historical results of operations as reliable indicators of our future performance if revenue or operating results fall short of the levels expected by public market analysts and investors the trading price of our common stock could decline dramatically 

our future revenue is dependent in part upon our installed customer base continuing to license additional 

products renew maintenance agreements and purchase additional services 

  our installed customer base has traditionally generated additional new license service and maintenance revenues in future periods customers may not necessarily license additional products or contract for additional services or maintenance maintenance is generally renewable annually at a customer’s option and there are no mandatory payment obligations or obligations to license additional software if our customers decide not to renew their maintenance agreements or license additional products or contract for additional services or if they reduce the scope of the maintenance agreements our revenue could decrease which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

we may not receive significant revenue from our current research and development efforts for several 

years if at all 

  internally developing software products and integrating acquired software products into existing platforms is expensive and these investments often require a long time to generate returns our strategy involves significant investments in software research and development and related product opportunities we believe 

11 that we must continue to dedicate a significant amount of resources to our research and development efforts to maintain our competitive position however we cannot predict that we will receive significant if any revenue from these investments 

we have acquired and expect to acquire other companies and businesses and may not realize the expected 

benefits of these acquisitions 

  we have acquired and expect to acquire other companies and businesses in the future while we expect to carefully analyze all potential acquisitions before committing to the transaction we cannot assure you that our management will be able to integrate and manage acquired products and businesses effectively or that the acquisitions will result in longterm benefits to us or our stockholders in addition acquisitions involve a number of risks if any of the following events occurs after we acquire another business it could seriously harm our business operating results and financial condition 

   in a number of our acquisitions we have agreed to make future cash or stock payments based on the performance of the businesses we acquired the performance goals pursuant to which these future payments may be made generally relate to achievement by the acquired business of certain specified bookings revenue product proliferation product development or employee retention goals during a specified period following completion of the applicable acquisition future acquisitions may involve issuances of stock as payment of the purchase price for the acquired business and also incentive stock or option grants to employees of the acquired businesses which may be dilutive to existing stockholders expenditure of substantial cash resources or the incurrence of material amounts of debt 

  the specific performance goal levels and amounts and timing of contingent purchase price payments vary with each acquisition in fiscal 2004 we issued or reserved for future issuance 11 million shares to former stockholders of acquired companies as contingent earnout purchase price in addition in fiscal 2004 we made cash payments of 170 million and accrued an additional 72 million of cash payments to former stockholders of acquired companies as contingent earnout purchase price 

  in connection with our acquisitions completed prior to january 1 2005 we may be obligated to pay up to an aggregate of 470 million in cash during the next 12 months and an additional 360 million in cash during the three years following the next 12 months if certain performance goals related to one or more of the following criteria are achieved in full revenue bookings product proliferation product development or employee retention 

  future acquisitions may result in increased goodwill and other intangible assets in addition to acquisitionrelated charges these assets may eventually be written down to the extent they are deemed to be impaired and any such impairments would adversely affect our results of operations 

12 our failure to attract train motivate and retain key employees may make us less competitive in our industries 

and therefore harm our results of operations 

  our business depends on the efforts and abilities of our senior management our research and development staff and a number of other key management sales support technical and services employees the high cost of training new employees not fully utilizing these employees or losing trained employees to competing employers could reduce our gross margins and harm our business and operating results competition for highly skilled employees can be intense particularly in geographic areas recognized as high technology centers such as the silicon valley area where our principal offices are located and the other locations where we maintain facilities if economic conditions continue to improve and job opportunities in the technology industry become more plentiful we may experience increased employee attrition and increased competition for skilled employees to attract retain and motivate individuals with the requisite expertise we may be required to grant large numbers of stock options or other stockbased incentive awards which may be dilutive to existing stockholders our adoption of statement of financial accounting standards or sfas no 123r “sharebased payment an amendment of fasb statements nos 123 and 95” during our third quarter of 2005 will result in additional compensation expense we may also be required to pay key employees significant base salaries and cash bonuses which could harm our operating results 

  in addition regulations adopted by the nyse and nasdaq require stockholder approval for new equity compensation plans and significant amendments to existing plans including increases in shares available for issuance under such plans and prohibit nyse and nasdaq member organizations from giving a proxy to vote on equity compensation plans unless the beneficial owner of the shares has given voting instructions these regulations could make it more difficult for us to grant equity compensation to employees in the future to the extent that these regulations make it more difficult or expensive to grant equity compensation to employees we may incur increased compensation costs or find it difficult to attract retain and motivate employees which could materially and adversely affect our business 

the competition in our industries is substantial and we cannot assure you that we will be able to continue 

to successfully compete in our industries 

  the eda market and the commercial electronics design and methodology services industries are highly competitive if we fail to compete successfully in these industries it could seriously harm our business operating results and financial condition to compete in these industries we must identify and develop or acquire innovative and cost competitive eda products integrate them into platforms and market them in a timely manner we must also gain industry acceptance for our design and methodology services and offer better strategic concepts technical solutions prices and response time or a combination of these factors than those of other design companies and the internal design departments of electronics manufacturers we cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully in these industries factors that could affect our ability to succeed include 

 13   we compete in the eda products market primarily with synopsys inc mentor graphics corporation and magma design automation inc we also compete with numerous smaller eda companies with manufacturers of electronic devices that have developed or have the capability to develop their own eda products and with numerous electronics design and consulting companies manufacturers of electronic devices may be reluctant to purchase services from independent vendors such as us because they wish to promote their own internal design departments 

we may need to change our pricing models to compete successfully 

  the intensely competitive markets in which we compete can put pressure on us to reduce the prices of our products if our competitors offer deep discounts on certain products in an effort to recapture or gain market segment share or to sell other software or hardware products we may then need to lower prices or offer other favorable terms to compete successfully any such changes would be likely to reduce our profit margins and could adversely affect our operating results any broadlybased changes to our prices and pricing policies could cause sales and software license revenues to decline or be delayed as our sales force implements and our customers adjust to the new pricing policies some of our competitors may bundle products for promotional purposes or as a longterm pricing strategy or provide guarantees of prices and product implementations these practices could over time significantly constrain the prices that we can charge for our products if we cannot offset price reductions with a corresponding increase in the number of sales or with lower spending then the reduced license revenues resulting from lower prices could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

we rely on our proprietary technology as well as software and other intellectual property rights licensed to us by third parties and we cannot assure you that the precautions taken to protect our rights will be adequate or that we will continue to be able to adequately secure such intellectual property rights from third parties 

  our success depends in part upon our proprietary technology we generally rely on patents copyrights trademarks trade secret laws licenses and restrictive agreements to establish and protect our proprietary rights in technology and products despite precautions we may take to protect our intellectual property we cannot assure you that third parties will not try to challenge invalidate or circumvent these safeguards we also cannot assure you that the rights granted under our patents or attendant to our other intellectual property will provide us with any competitive advantages or that patents will be issued on any of our pending applications or that future patents will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology furthermore the laws of foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights in those countries to the same extent as applicable law protects these rights in the united states many of our products include software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties we may have to seek new or renew existing licenses for such software and other intellectual property in the future our design services business holds licenses to certain software and other intellectual property owned by third parties our failure to obtain for our use software or other intellectual property licenses or other intellectual property rights on favorable terms or the need to engage in litigation over these licenses or rights could seriously harm our business operating results and financial condition 

we could lose key technology or suffer serious harm to our business because of the infringement of our intellectual property rights by third parties or because of our infringement of the intellectual property rights of third parties 

  there are numerous patents in the eda industry and new patents are being issued at a rapid rate it is not always practicable to determine in advance whether a product or any of its components infringes the patent rights of others as a result from time to time we may be forced to respond to or prosecute intellectual property infringement claims to protect our rights or defend a customer’s rights these claims regardless of merit could consume valuable management time result in costly litigation or cause product shipment delays all of which could seriously harm our business operating results and financial condition in settling these claims we may be required to enter into royalty or licensing agreements with the third parties claiming 

14 infringement these royalty or licensing agreements if available may not have terms favorable to us being forced to enter into a license agreement with unfavorable terms could seriously harm our business operating results and financial condition any potential intellectual property litigation could force us to do one or more of the following 

   if we were forced to take any of these actions our business and results of operations may suffer 

if our security measures are breached and an unauthorized party obtains access to customer data our 

information systems may be perceived as being insecure and customers may curtail their use of or stop their use of our products and services 

  our products and services involve the storage and transmission of customers’ proprietary information and breaches of our security measures could expose us to a risk of loss or misuse of this information litigation and potential liability because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage information systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventive measures if an actual or perceived breach of our security occurs the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed and we could lose existing customers and our ability to obtain new customers 

we may not be able to effectively implement our restructuring activities and our restructuring activities 

may not result in the expected benefits which would negatively impact our future results of operations 

  the eda market and the commercial electronics design and methodology services industries are highly competitive and change quickly we have responded to increased competition and changes in the industries in which we compete by restructuring our operations and reducing the size of our workforce despite our restructuring efforts over the last few years we cannot assure you that we will achieve all of the operating expense reductions and improvements in operating margins and cash flows currently anticipated from these restructuring activities in the periods contemplated or at all our inability to realize these benefits and our failure to appropriately structure our business to meet market conditions could negatively impact our results of operations 

  as part of our recent restructuring activities we have reduced the workforce in certain revenuegenerating portions of our business particularly in our services business this reduction in staffing levels could require us to forego certain future strategic opportunities due to limited resources which could negatively affect our longterm revenues 

  in addition these workforce reductions could result in a lack of focus and reduced productivity by remaining employees due to changes in responsibilities or concern about future prospects which in turn may negatively affect our future revenues further we believe our future success depends in large part on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled personnel our restructuring activities could negatively affect our ability to attract such personnel as a result of perceived risk of future workforce reductions 

  in early 2005 we announced a new plan of restructuring we also cannot assure you that we will not be required to implement further restructuring activities or reductions in our workforce based on changes in the markets and industries in which we compete or that any future restructuring efforts will be successful 

the lengthy sales cycle of our products and services makes the timing of our revenue difficult to predict and 

may cause our operating results to fluctuate unexpectedly 

  we have a lengthy sales cycle that generally extends at least three to six months the length of the sales cycle may cause our revenue and operating results to vary from quarter to quarter the complexity and 

15 expense associated with our business generally requires a lengthy customer education evaluation and approval process consequently we may incur substantial expenses and devote significant management effort and expense to develop potential relationships that do not result in agreements or revenue and may prevent us from pursuing other opportunities 

  in addition sales of our products and services may be delayed if customers delay approval or commencement of projects because of 

  • the timing of customers’ competitive evaluation processes or 

  • customers’ budgetary constraints and budget cycles 

  lengthy sales cycles for acceleration and emulation hardware products subject us to a number of significant risks over which we have limited control including insufficient excess or obsolete inventory variations in inventory valuation and fluctuations in quarterly operating results 

  also because of the timing of large orders and our customers’ buying patterns we may not learn of bookings shortfalls revenue shortfalls earnings shortfalls or other failures to meet market expectations until late in a fiscal quarter which could cause even more immediate and serious harm to the trading price of our common stock 

the profitability of our services business depends on factors that are difficult to control such as the high 

cost of our services employees our cost of performing our fixedprice services contracts and the success of our design services business which has historically suffered losses 

  to be successful in our services business we must overcome several factors that are difficult to control including the following 

 our international operations may seriously harm our financial condition because of the effect of foreign 

exchange rate fluctuations and other risks to our international business 

  we have significant operations outside the united states our revenue from international operations as a percentage of total revenue was approximately 50 in 2004 44 in 2003 and 45 in 2002 we expect that revenue from our international operations will continue to account for a significant portion of our total revenue we also transact business in various foreign currencies recent economic and political uncertainty and the volatility of foreign currencies in certain regions most notably the japanese yen european union euro and the british pound have had and may in the future have a harmful effect on our revenue and operating results 

  fluctuations in the rate of exchange between the us dollar and the currencies of other countries in which we conduct business could seriously harm our business operating results and financial condition for 

16 example if there is an increase in the rate at which a foreign currency exchanges into us dollars it will take more of the foreign currency to equal the same amount of us dollars than before the rate increase if we price our products and services in the foreign currency we will receive fewer us dollars than we did before the rate increase went into effect if we price our products and services in us dollars an increase in the exchange rate will result in an increase in the price for our products and services compared to those products of our competitors that are priced in local currency this could result in our prices being uncompetitive in markets where business is transacted in the local currency 

  exposure to foreign currency transaction risk can arise when transactions are conducted in a currency different from the functional currency of one of our subsidiaries a subsidiary’s functional currency is generally the currency in which it primarily conducts its operations including product pricing expenses and borrowings although we attempt to reduce the impact of foreign currency fluctuations significant exchange rate movements may hurt our results of operations as expressed in us dollars 

  our international operations may also be subject to other risks including 

   we have offices throughout the world including key research facilities outside of the united states our operations are dependent upon the connectivity of our operations throughout the world activities that interfere with our international connectivity such as computer “hacking” or the introduction of a virus into our computer systems could significantly interfere with our business operations 

our operating results could be adversely affected as a result of changes in our effective tax rates 

  our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by the following 

   any significant change in our future effective tax rates could adversely impact our results of operations for future periods 

we have received an examination report from the internal revenue service proposing a tax deficiency in 

certain of our tax returns and the outcome of the examination or any future examinations involving similar claims may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows 

  the irs and other tax authorities regularly examine our income tax returns in november 2003 the irs completed its field examination of our federal income tax returns for the tax years 1997 through 1999 and issued a revenue agent’s report or rar in which the irs proposes to assess an aggregate tax deficiency for 

17 the threeyear period of approximately 1430 million plus interest which interest will accrue until the matter is resolved this interest is compounded daily at rates published by the irs which rates have been between four and nine percent since 1997 and adjust quarterly the irs may also make similar claims for years subsequent to 1999 in future examinations the rar is not a final statutory notice of deficiency and we have filed a protest to certain of the proposed adjustments with the appeals office of the irs where the matter is currently being considered 

  the most significant of the disputed adjustments relates to transfer pricing arrangements that we have with a foreign subsidiary we believe that the proposed irs adjustments are inconsistent with the applicable tax laws and that we have meritorious defenses to the proposed adjustments we are challenging these proposed adjustments vigorously 

  the irs is currently examining our federal income tax returns for tax years 2000 through 2002 

  significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations including the current irs examination and the irs rar for the tax years 1997 through 1999 however the ultimate outcome of tax examinations cannot be predicted with certainty including the total amount payable or the timing of any such payments upon resolution of these issues in addition we cannot assure you that such amount will not be materially different than that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals should the irs or other tax authorities assess additional taxes as a result of a current or a future examination we may be required to record charges to operations in future periods that could have a material impact on the results of operations financial position or cash flows in the applicable period or periods recorded 

forecasting our estimated annual effective tax rate is complex and subject to uncertainty and material 

differences between forecasted and actual tax rates could have a material impact on our results of operations 

  forecasts of our income tax position and resultant effective tax rate are complex and subject to uncertainty because our income tax position for each year combines the effects of a mix of profits and losses earned by us and our subsidiaries in tax jurisdictions with a broad range of income tax rates as well as benefits from available deferred tax assets and costs resulting from tax audits to forecast our global tax rate pretax profits and losses by jurisdiction are estimated and tax expense by jurisdiction is calculated if the mix of profits and losses our ability to use tax credits or effective tax rates by jurisdiction is different than those estimates our actual tax rate could be materially different than forecasted which could have a material impact on our results of operations 

failure to obtain export licenses could harm our business by rendering us unable to ship products and transfer 

our technology outside of the united states 

  we must comply with us department of commerce regulations in shipping our software products and transferring our technology outside the united states and to foreign nationals although we have not had any significant difficulty complying with these regulations so far any significant future difficulty in complying could harm our business operating results and financial condition 

errors or defects in our products and services could expose us to liability and harm our reputation 

  our customers use our products and services in designing and developing products that involve a high degree of technological complexity each of which has its own specifications because of the complexity of the systems and products with which we work some of our products and designs can be adequately tested only when put to full use in the marketplace as a result our customers or their end users may discover errors or 

18 defects in our software or the systems we design or the products or systems incorporating our design and intellectual property may not operate as expected errors or defects could result in 

 new accounting standards related to equity compensation will cause us to recognize an additional expense but 

the resulting reduction in our net income is unknown 

  in december 2004 the financial accounting standards board or fasb issued sfas no 123r which requires the measurement of all employee sharebased payments to employees including grants of employee stock options using a fairvaluebased method and the recording of such expense in our consolidated statements of operations the accounting provisions of sfas no 123r are effective for reporting periods beginning after june 15 2005 we are required to adopt sfas no 123r in our third quarter of fiscal 2005 see “stockbased compensation” of note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for the pro forma net income loss and net income loss per share amounts for 2004 2003 and 2002 as if we had used a fairvaluebased method similar to the methods required under sfas no 123r to measure compensation expense for employee stock incentive awards although we have not yet determined whether the adoption of sfas no 123r will result in future amounts that are similar to the current pro forma disclosures under sfas no 123 we are evaluating the requirements under sfas no 123r and expect the adoption to have a significant adverse effect on our consolidated statements of operations and net income per share 

if we become subject to unfair hiring claims we could be prevented from hiring needed employees incur 

liability for damages and incur substantial costs in defending ourselves 

  companies in our industry whose employees accept positions with competitors frequently claim that these competitors have engaged in unfair hiring practices or that the employment of these persons would involve the disclosure or use of trade secrets these claims could prevent us from hiring employees or cause us to incur liability for damages we could also incur substantial costs in defending ourselves or our employees against these claims regardless of their merits defending ourselves from these claims could also divert the attention of our management from our operations 

our business is subject to the risk of earthquakes floods and other natural catastrophic events 

  our corporate headquarters including certain of our research and development operations and certain of our distribution facilities are located in the silicon valley area of northern california which is a region known to experience seismic activity in addition several of our facilities including our corporate headquarters certain of our research and development operations and certain of our distribution operations are in areas of san jose california that have been identified by the director of the federal emergency management agency or fema as being located in a special flood area the areas at risk are identified as being in a one hundred year flood plain using fema’s flood hazard boundary map or the flood insurance rate map if significant seismic or flooding activity were to occur our operations may be interrupted which would adversely impact our business and results of operations 

we maintain research and other facilities in parts of the world that are not as politically stable as the united 

states and as a result we may face a higher risk of business interruption from acts of war or terrorism than other businesses located only or primarily in the united states 

  we maintain international research and other facilities some of which are in parts of the world that are not as politically stable as the united states consequently we may face a greater risk of business interruption as a result of terrorist acts or military conflicts than businesses located domestically furthermore this potential harm is exacerbated given that damage to or disruptions at our international research and 

19 development facilities could have an adverse effect on our ability to develop new or improve existing products as compared to other businesses which may only have sales offices or other less critical operations abroad we are not insured for losses or interruptions caused by acts of war or terrorism 

if we are unable to favorably assess the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting or if our 

independent auditors are unable to provide an unqualified attestation report on our assessment in the future our stock price could be adversely affected 

  under the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 or the act we are required to assess the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting and assert that such internal controls are effective our independent auditors must evaluate management’s assessment concerning the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting and render an opinion on our assessment and the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting the act has resulted in and is likely to continue to result in increased expenses and has required and is likely to continue to require significant efforts by management and other employees although we believe that our efforts will enable us to remain compliant under the act we can give no assurance that in the future such efforts will be successful our business is complex and involves significant judgments and estimates as described in our “critical accounting estimates” if certain judgments and estimates are determined incorrectly we may be unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective or our independent auditors may not be able to render the required attestation concerning our assessment and the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting which could adversely effect investor confidence in us and the market price of our common stock 

risks related to our securities 

our debt obligations expose us to risks that could adversely affect our business operating results and financial 

condition and could prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under such indebtedness 

  we have a substantial level of debt as of january 1 2005 we had 4200 million of outstanding indebtedness from the convertible notes or the notes that we issued in august 2003 the level of our indebtedness among other things could 

   if we experience a decline in revenue due to any of the factors described in this section entitled “factors that may affect future results” or otherwise we could have difficulty paying amounts due on our indebtedness in the case of the notes although the notes mature in 2023 the holders of the notes may require us to repurchase their notes at an additional premium in 2008 which makes it probable that we will be required to repurchase the notes in 2008 if the notes are not otherwise converted into our common stock if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow or otherwise obtain funds necessary to make required payments or if we fail to comply with the various requirements of our indebtedness including the notes we would be in default which would permit the holders of our indebtedness to accelerate the maturity of the indebtedness and could cause defaults under our other indebtedness any default under our indebtedness could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

  we are not restricted under our outstanding indebtedness from incurring additional debt including other senior indebtedness or secured indebtedness in addition our outstanding indebtedness does not restrict our ability to pay dividends issue or repurchase stock or other securities or require us to achieve or maintain any 

20 minimum financial results relating to our financial position or results of operations our ability to recapitalize incur additional debt and take a number of other actions that are not limited by the terms of our outstanding indebtedness could have the effect of diminishing our ability to make payments on such indebtedness when due although the notes do not contain such financial and other restrictive covenants future indebtedness could include such covenants if we incur additional indebtedness or other liabilities our ability to pay our obligations on our outstanding indebtedness could be adversely affected 

we may be unable to adequately service our indebtedness which may result in defaults and other costs to us 

  we may not have sufficient funds or may be unable to arrange for additional financing to pay the outstanding obligations due on our indebtedness any future borrowing arrangements or debt agreements to which we become a party may contain restrictions on or prohibitions against our repayment on our outstanding indebtedness with respect to the notes at maturity the entire outstanding principal amount of the notes will become due and payable holders may require us to repurchase for cash all or any portion of the notes on august 15 2008 for 10025 of the principal amount august 15 2013 for 10000 of the principal amount and august 15 2018 for 10000 of the principal amount as a result although the notes mature in 2023 the holders may require us to repurchase the notes at an additional premium in 2008 which makes it probable that we will be required to repurchase the notes in 2008 if the notes are not otherwise converted into our common stock if we are prohibited from paying our outstanding indebtedness we could try to obtain the consent of lenders under those arrangements or we could attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain the restrictions if we do not obtain the necessary consents or refinance the borrowings we may be unable to satisfy our outstanding indebtedness any such failure would constitute an event of default under our indebtedness which could in turn constitute a default under the terms of any other indebtedness then outstanding 

  in addition a material default on our indebtedness could suspend our eligibility to register securities using certain registration statement forms under sec guidelines which permit incorporation by reference of substantial information regarding us which could potentially hinder our ability to raise capital through the issuance of our securities and will increase the costs of such registration to us 

the price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly which may make it difficult for stockholders to sell 

our common stock when desired or at attractive prices 

  the market price of our common stock is subject to significant fluctuations in response to the factors set forth in this section entitled “factors that may affect future results” and other factors many of which are beyond our control such fluctuations as well as economic conditions generally may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

  in addition the stock markets in recent years have experienced extreme price and trading volume fluctuations that often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of individual companies these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the price of our common stock regardless of our operating performance 

conversion of the notes will dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders 

  the terms of the notes permit the holders to convert the notes into shares of our common stock the notes are convertible into our common stock initially at a conversion price of 1565 per share which would result in an aggregate of approximately 268 million shares of our common stock issued upon conversion subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events the conversion of some or all of the notes will dilute the ownership interest of our existing stockholders any sales in the public market of the common stock issuable upon conversion could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock prior to the conversion of the notes if the trading price of our common stock exceeds the conversion price of the notes by 14500 or more over specified periods basic earnings per share will be diluted if and to the extent the convertible notes hedge instruments are not exercised we may redeem for cash all or any part of the notes on or after august 15 2008 for 10000 of the principal amount the holders may require us to repurchase for 

21 cash all or any portion of their notes on august 15 2008 for 10025 of the principal amount on august 15 2013 for 10000 of the principal amount or on august 15 2018 for 10000 of the principal amount 

  each 1000 of principal of the notes is initially convertible into 63879 shares of our common stock subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events holders of the notes may convert their notes prior to maturity only if 1 the price of our common stock reaches 2269 during certain periods of time specified in the notes 2 specified corporate transactions occur 3 the notes have been called for redemption or 4 the trading price of the notes falls below a certain threshold as a result although the notes mature in 2023 the holders may require us to repurchase their notes at an additional premium in 2008 which makes it probable that we will be required to repurchase the notes in 2008 if the notes are not otherwise converted into our common stock as of january 1 2005 none of the conditions allowing holders of the notes to convert had been met 

  although the conversion price is currently 1565 per share the convertible notes hedge and warrant transactions that we entered into in connection with the issuance of the notes effectively increased the conversion price of the notes until 2008 to approximately 2308 per share which would result in an aggregate issuance upon conversion prior to august 15 2008 of approximately 182 million shares of our common stock we have entered into convertible notes hedge and warrant transactions to reduce the potential dilution from the conversion of the notes however we cannot guarantee that such convertible notes hedge and warrant instruments will fully mitigate the dilution in addition the existence of the notes may encourage short selling by market participants because the conversion of the notes could depress the price of our common stock 

we may at the option of the noteholders and only in certain circumstances be required to repurchase the 

notes in shares of our common stock upon a significant change in our corporate ownership or structure and issuance of shares to repurchase the notes would result in dilution to our existing stockholders 

  under the terms of the notes we may be required to repurchase the notes following a significant change in our corporate ownership or structure such as a change of control prior to maturity of the notes following a significant change in our corporate ownership or structure in certain circumstances we may choose to pay the repurchase price of the notes in cash shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock in the event we choose to pay all or any part of the repurchase price of notes in shares of our common stock this would result in dilution to the holders of our common stock 

convertible notes hedge and warrant transactions entered into in connection with the issuance of the 

notes may affect the value of our common stock 

  we entered into convertible notes hedge transactions with jp morgan chase bank an affiliate of one of the initial purchasers of the notes at the time of issuance of the notes with the objective of reducing the potential dilutive effect of issuing our common stock upon conversion of the notes we also entered into warrant transactions in connection with our convertible notes hedge and warrant transactions jp morgan chase bank or its affiliates purchased our common stock in secondary market transactions and entered into various overthecounter derivative transactions with respect to our common stock this entity or its affiliates is likely to modify its hedge positions from time to time prior to conversion or maturity of the notes by purchasing and selling shares of our common stock other of our securities or other instruments it may wish to use in connection with such hedging the effect if any of any of these transactions and activities on the market price of our common stock or the notes could adversely affect the value of our common stock and as a result the number of shares and the value of the common stock holders will receive upon conversion of the notes in addition subject to movement in the trading price of our common stock if the convertible notes hedge transactions settle in our favor we could be exposed to credit risk related to the other party 

22 rating agencies may provide unsolicited ratings on the notes that could reduce the market value or 

liquidity of our common stock 

  we have not requested a rating of the notes from any rating agency and we do not anticipate that the notes will be rated however if one or more rating agencies independently elects to rate the notes and assigns the notes a rating lower than the rating expected by investors or reduces their rating in the future the market price or liquidity of the notes and our common stock could be harmed a resulting decline in the market price of the notes as compared to the price of our common stock may require us to repurchase the notes 

antitakeover defenses in our governing documents and certain provisions under delaware law could 

prevent an acquisition of our company or limit the price that investors might be willing to pay for our common stock 

  our governing documents and certain provisions of the delaware general corporation law that apply to us could make it difficult for another company to acquire control of our company for example 

   all or any one of these factors could limit the price that certain investors would be willing to pay for shares of our common stock and could delay prevent or allow our board of directors to resist an acquisition of our company even if the proposed transaction were favored by a majority of our independent stockholders

 item 3 legal proceedings tableend   from time to time we are involved in various disputes and litigation matters that arise in the ordinary course of business these include disputes and lawsuits related to intellectual property mergers and acquisitions licensing contract law distribution arrangements and employee relations matters periodically we review the status of each significant matter and assess its potential financial exposure if the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and a range of possible losses can be estimated we accrue a liability for the estimated loss at the low end of the range legal proceedings are subject to uncertainties and the outcomes are difficult to predict because of such uncertainties accruals are based only on the best information available at the time as additional information becomes available we reassess the potential liability related to pending claims and litigation and may revise estimates 

23   while the outcome of these disputes and litigation matters cannot be predicted with any certainty management does not believe that the outcome of any current matters will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations

overview 

general 

  we license eda software sell or lease eda hardware technology and intellectual property and provide design and methodology services throughout the world to help manage and accelerate electronic product development processes our broad range of products and services are used by electronics companies to design and develop complex ics ic packages and pcbs and personal and commercial electronic systems for a detailed discussion of the challenges and opportunities of the eda industry and our products and services see item 1 “business” above 

  as part of our strategy we have acquired companies businesses and third party intellectual property to obtain technology key personnel and customer relationships and we expect to continue making acquisitions in the future 

  from 2000 through 2002 ic manufacturers and electronics companies experienced a severe downturn in demand and production according to the semiconductor industry association or sia semiconductor manufacturers experienced a reduction in revenues of over 35 from late 2000 to 2002 this economic downturn resulted in reduced research and development spending by many of our customers 

  during 2003 and 2004 ic manufacturers and electronics companies experienced a recovery in revenues according to the sia semiconductor industry revenues grew by approximately 18 in 2003 and 28 in 2004 however despite this recovery our customers continued to spend cautiously through 2004 we expect this cautious spending to continue at least through 2005 as ic manufacturers and electronics companies revenues are expected to remain flat in 2005 compared to 2004 

  in response to the general downturn in the economy and in the electronics industry in particular we have initiated significant restructuring activities over the past several years including during 2004 to better align our cost structure with projected demand for our products and services and their resulting projected revenues we have announced additional restructuring activities during 2005 and expect to announce further restructurings in the future 

  we have identified certain items that management uses as performance indicators to manage our business including revenue certain elements of operating expenses and cash flow from operations and we describe these items more fully in the “results of operations” below 

28   we continue to observe a customer preference for renewable license types which are term and subscription and expect the timing of license renewals to continue to impact our results of operations 

  product revenue recognized from backlog comprised approximately 68 of total product revenue in 2004 60 in 2003 and 45 in 2002 this trend is primarily due to increasing customer preference for subscription licenses and customer requirements for more flexible payment terms 

acquisitions 

  we have acquired companies businesses and third party technology some of which are described below and we expect to acquire other companies businesses and third party technology in the future we undertake these acquisitions as part of our overall business strategy and specifically to acquire key personnel technology and customer relationships of the acquired business for each of these acquisitions the results of operations and the estimated fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed have been included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of the acquisition these acquisitions are described in more detail below and in note 4 to our consolidated financial statements 

  comparative pro forma financial information was not presented for the 2004 or 2003 acquisitions because these acquisitions were not material to our consolidated financial statements either individually or in the aggregate for additional information regarding our 2004 acquisitions see “liquidity and capital resources” and “results of operations” found below in this item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

  a summary of certain information regarding acquisitions all of which were for cash we completed in 2004 and 2003 including the aggregate initial purchase price paid is as follows 

   the businesses or assets acquired include 

      the purchase prices of our acquisitions generally consist of one or more of the following cash payments shares of our common stock the fair value of assumed options if any and acquisition costs in general the purchase price and goodwill associated with business acquisitions will increase above the initial purchase price paid if certain performance goals related to one or more of the following revenue bookings product proliferation product development and employee retention which are measured over periods of up to four years following the acquisitions are achieved 

29   concurrent with our acquisition of certain innotech assets we also modified our distributor agreement with innotech prior to this acquisition we licensed most of our software products in japan through innotech of which we were an approximately 15 stockholder as of january 1 2005 we now directly license our software products to the customers for which we acquired the distribution rights from innotech 

  for almost all of our acquisitions of private companies a portion of the purchase price is payable after the acquired business group’s achievement of certain performance goals which generally relate to one or more of the following revenue bookings product proliferation product development and employee retention the specific performance goal levels and amounts and timing of contingent purchase price payments vary with each acquisition in connection with some acquisitions we may grant equity awards with either timebased or performancebased vesting or a combination of both to employees of the acquired business as performance incentives as a result the amount of cash consideration or shares of our common stock issued to former stockholders of the acquired entity will increase as performance goals are achieved generally over a period of up to four years following the completion of the respective acquisition accordingly goodwill and stock compensation expense will increase upon the attainment of such goals 

  during 2004 we recorded 406 million of goodwill as contingent purchase price payable to stockholders of acquired companies the 406 million of goodwill consisted of 170 million of actual cash payments 72 million of accrued cash payments and the issuance of 11 million shares of our common stock valued at 164 million in addition we recognized stock compensation expense of 12 million in connection with these acquisitions in accordance with financial accounting standards board interpretation no 44 “accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation an interpretation of apb no 25” the additional goodwill and stock compensation expense was related to the achievement of certain performance goals associated with one or more of the following criteria revenue bookings product proliferation product development and employee retention the portion of the earnout associated with employee retention is recorded as compensation expense 

  during 2003 we paid 24 million in cash and issued or reserved for issuance an additional 37 million shares of our common stock valued at 577 million related to acquisition earnouts we recorded 523 million in additional goodwill consisting of 24 million in cash and 499 million representing the issuance or reserve for issuance of 32 million shares we also recorded additional stock compensation expense of 78 million representing the issuance or reserve for issuance of 04 million shares for earnouts achieved during 2003 in addition we recorded 05 million in deferred stock compensation for estimated future earnouts in accordance with fasb interpretation no 28 “accounting for stock appreciation rights and other variable stock option or award plans” the additional goodwill and stock compensation expense related to the achievement of certain performance goals associated with one or more of the following criteria revenue bookings product proliferation product development and employee retention the portion of the earnout associated with employee retention is recorded as compensation expense 

  in connection with our acquisitions completed prior to january 1 2005 we may be obligated to pay up to an aggregate of 470 million in cash during the next 12 months and an additional 360 million in cash during the three years following the next 12 months if certain performance goals related to one or more of the following criteria are achieved in full revenue bookings product proliferation product development and employee retention 

  the goodwill recorded in connection with the abovedescribed contingent earnouts for acquisitions is not expected to be deductible for income tax purposes 

legal settlements 

  in september 2003 we entered into a settlement with mentor graphics corporation pursuant to which cadence mentor and their respective affiliated parties settled all outstanding litigation between the companies and such affiliated parties relating to emulation and acceleration systems the companies also agreed that for a period of seven years neither will sue the other over patented emulation and acceleration technology mentor also paid us 180 million in cash as part of the settlement net of related legal costs we recorded a gain of 145 million during the year ended january 3 2004 for the settlement 

30   in november 2002 we announced the settlement of civil litigation filed against avant corporation seeking damages related to theft of our intellectual property including software code as well as other trade secrets the settlement with avant its parent corporation synopsys inc and several individuals included an agreement to dismiss all pending claims and counterclaims in the litigation and required the payment to us of 2650 million which amount was received in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2002 net of related legal costs we recorded a gain of 2611 million during the year ended december 28 2002 for the settlement 

critical accounting estimates 

  in preparing our consolidated financial statements we make assumptions judgments and estimates that can have a significant impact on our revenue operating income loss and net income loss as well as on the value of certain assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets we base our assumptions judgments and estimates on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions on a regular basis we evaluate our assumptions judgments and estimates and make changes accordingly we believe that the assumptions judgments and estimates involved in the accounting for revenue recognition accounting for income taxes valuation of longlived and intangible assets and goodwill and restructuring charges have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements therefore we consider these to be our critical accounting estimates historically our assumptions judgments and estimates relative to our critical accounting estimates have not differed materially from actual results for further information on our significant accounting policies see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition 

  we apply the provisions of statement of position or sop 972 “software revenue recognition” as amended by statement of position 989 “modification of sop 972 software revenue recognition with respect to certain transactions” to all product revenue transactions where the software is not incidental we also apply the provisions of sfas no 13 “accounting for leases” to all hardware lease transactions we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists the product has been delivered the fee is fixed or determinable collection of the resulting receivable is probable and vendorspecific objective evidence of fair value or vsoe exists 

  persuasive evidence of an arrangement  — for subscription and term licenses and hardware leases we use the signed contract as evidence of an arrangement for perpetual licenses hardware sales maintenance renewals and small fixedprice service projects such as training classes and small standard methodology service engagements of approximately 10000 or less we use a purchase order as evidence of an arrangement for all other service engagements we use a signed professional services agreement and a statement of work to evidence an arrangement sales through our distributors are evidenced by a master agreement governing the relationship together with binding purchase orders from the distributor on a transactionbytransaction basis 

  product delivery  — software and the corresponding access keys are generally delivered to customers electronically electronic delivery occurs when we provide the customer access to the software occasionally we will deliver the software on a compact disc with standard transfer terms of freeonboard shipping point our software license agreements generally do not contain acceptance provisions with respect to hardware delivery of an entire system is deemed to occur upon its installation 

  fee is fixed or determinable  — we assess whether a fee is fixed or determinable at the outset of the arrangement primarily based on the payment terms associated with the transaction we use installment contracts that extend up to a maximum of five years from the contract date for certain term and subscription licenses and we have established a history of collecting under the original contract without providing concessions on payments products or services our installment contracts that do not include a substantial up front payment have payment periods that are equal to or less than the term of the licenses and the payments are collected quarterly in equal or nearly equal installments when evaluated over the entire term of the arrangement 

31   significant judgment is involved in assessing whether a fee is fixed or determinable including assessing whether a contract amendment constitutes a concession our experience has been that we are able to determine whether a fee is fixed or determinable while we do not expect that experience to change if we no longer had a history of collecting under the original contract without providing concessions on term licenses revenue from term licenses would be required to be recognized when payments under the installment contract become due and payable this change could have a material impact on our results of operations 

  collection is probable  — we have concluded that collection is not probable for license arrangements executed with entities in certain countries for all other countries we assess collectibility at the outset of the arrangement based on a number of factors including the customer’s past payment history and its current creditworthiness if in our judgment collection of a fee is not probable we defer the revenue until the uncertainty is removed which generally means revenue is recognized upon our receipt of cash payment our experience has been that we are able to estimate whether collection is probable while we do not expect that experience to change if we were to determine that collection is not probable for any license arrangement with installment payment terms revenue from such license would be recognized generally upon the receipt of cash payment this change could have a material impact on our results of operations 

  vendorspecific objective evidence of fair value  — our vsoe for certain product elements of an arrangement is based upon the pricing in comparable transactions when the element is sold separately vsoe for maintenance is generally based upon the customer’s stated annual renewal rates vsoe for services is generally based on the price charged when the services are sold separately for multiple element arrangements vsoe must exist to allocate the total fee among all delivered and undelivered elements in the arrangement if vsoe does not exist for all elements to support the allocation of the total fee among all delivered and undelivered elements of the arrangement revenue is deferred until such evidence does exist for the undelivered elements or until all elements are delivered whichever is earlier if vsoe of all undelivered elements exists but vsoe does not exist for one or more delivered elements revenue is recognized using the residual method under the residual method the vsoe of the undelivered elements is deferred and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee is recognized as revenue as elements are delivered our experience has been that we are able to estimate vsoe while we do not expect that experience to change if we could no longer support vsoe for undelivered elements of multiple element arrangements revenue would be deferred until we have vsoe for the undelivered elements or all elements are delivered whichever is earlier this change could have a material impact on our results of operations 

  finance fee revenue  — finance fees result from discounting to present value the product revenue derived from our installment contracts in which the payment terms extend beyond one year from the contract effective date finance fees are recognized ratably over the relevant license term and are classified as product revenue finance fee revenue represented 2 of total revenue for 2004 1 of total revenue for 2003 and 1 of total revenue for 2002 

  services revenue  — services revenue consists primarily of revenue received for performing methodology and design services these services are not related to the functionality of our software licenses revenue from service contracts is recognized either on the time and materials method as work is performed or on the percentageofcompletion method for contracts with fixed or nottoexceed fees we estimate on a monthly basis the percentageofcompletion which is based on the completion of milestones relating to the arrangement we have a history of accurately estimating project status and the costs necessary to complete projects a number of internal and external factors can affect our estimates including labor rates utilization and efficiency variances and specification and testing requirement changes if different conditions were to prevail such that accurate estimates could not be made then the use of the completed contract method would be required and the recognition of all revenue and costs would be deferred until the project was completed this change could have a material impact on our results of operations 

accounting for income taxes 

  we provide for the effect of income taxes in our condensed consolidated financial statements in accordance with sfas no 109 “accounting for income taxes” under sfas no 109 income tax expense 

32 benefit is recognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and for deferred tax assets and liabilities for the tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity’s financial statements or tax returns 

  we must make significant assumptions judgments and estimates to determine our current provision for income taxes our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance to be recorded against our deferred tax assets our judgments assumptions and estimates relating to the current provision for income taxes take into account current tax laws our interpretation of current tax laws and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax authorities changes in tax law or our interpretation of tax laws and developments in current and future tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our results of operations financial position or cash flows our assumptions judgments and estimates relating to the value of our net deferred tax assets take into account predictions of the amount and category of future taxable income from potential sources including tax planning strategies that would if necessary be implemented to prevent a loss carryforward or tax credit carryforward from expiring unused actual operating results and the underlying amount and category of income in future years could render our current assumptions judgments and estimates of recoverable net deferred taxes inaccurate thus materially affecting our results of operations and financial position 

  see the factors affecting future results above in item 1 “business” entitled “our operating results could be adversely affected as a result of changes in our effective tax rates” “we have received an examination report from the internal revenue service proposing a tax deficiency in certain of our tax returns and the outcome of the examination or any future examinations involving similar claims may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows” and “forecasting our estimated annual effective tax rate is complex and subject to uncertainty and material differences between forecasted and actual tax rates could have a material impact on our results of operations” 

valuation of longlived and intangible assets including goodwill 

  at least annually we review goodwill resulting from business combinations for impairment in accordance with sfas no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” 

  our annual impairment review process compares the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value including the goodwill related to the reporting unit to determine the reporting unit’s fair value we utilize a combination of the income and market valuation approaches 

  the income approach provides an estimate of fair value based on the present value of expected future cash flows these expected future cash flows are based on our assumed market segment growth rates assumed market segment share growth rates estimated costs and appropriate discount rates based on the reporting units’ weighted average cost of capital as determined by considering the observable weighted average cost of capital of comparable companies our estimates of market segment growth our market segment share growth and costs are based on historical data various internal estimates and a variety of external sources and are developed as part of our routine longrange planning process 

  the market approach provides an estimate of the fair value of the equity of a business by comparing it to publicly traded companies in similar lines of business the conditions and prospects of companies in similar lines of business depend on common factors such as overall demand for their products and services factors such as size growth profitability risk and return on investment are also analyzed and compared to comparable companies various price or market multiples are then applied to our reporting units’ operating results to arrive at an estimate of fair value 

  in determining our overall conclusion of reporting unit fair value we considered the estimated values derived from both the income and market valuation approaches the weighting applied to the market approach depends on the similarity of the comparable businesses to the reporting unit 

  we review longlived assets including certain identifiable intangibles for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that we will not be able to recover the asset’s carrying amount in accordance with sfas no 144 “accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets” 

33   for longlived assets to be held and used including acquired intangibles we initiate our review whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a longlived asset may not be recoverable recoverability of an asset is measured by comparing its carrying amount to the expected future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of that asset excluding future interest costs that would be recognized as an expense when incurred any impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair market value significant management judgment is required in 

   material impairment charges could be necessary should different conditions prevail or different judgments be made 

restructuring charges 

  we account for restructuring charges in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 100 “restructuring and impairment charges” since fiscal 2001 we have undertaken significant restructuring initiatives all restructuring activities initiated prior to fiscal 2003 were accounted for in accordance with eitf no 943 “liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring” and eitf no 8810 “costs associated with lease modifications or terminations” for restructuring activities initiated after fiscal 2002 we accounted for the facilities and assetrelated portions of these restructurings in accordance with sfas no 146 “accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities” in addition for all years presented we accounted for the facilities and assetrelated portions of these restructurings in accordance with sfas no 144 “accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets” the severance and benefits charges were accounted for in accordance with sfas no 112 “employers’ accounting for postemployment benefits — an amendment of fasb statements no 5 and 43” 

  these restructuring initiatives have required us to make a number of estimates and assumptions related to losses on excess facilities vacated or consolidated particularly estimating when if at all we will be able to sublet vacated facilities and if we do the sublease terms closure and space reduction costs that are part of our restructuring charges include payments required under leases less any applicable estimated sublease income after the facilities are abandoned lease buyout costs and certain contractual costs to maintain facilities during the abandonment period 

  in addition we have recorded estimated provisions for termination benefits and outplacement costs and other restructuring costs we regularly evaluate the adequacy of our restructuring accrual and adjust the balance based on changes in estimates and assumptions we may incur future charges for new restructuring activities as well as changes in estimates to amounts previously recorded 

results of operations 

  we primarily generate revenue from licensing our eda software and selling or leasing hardware technology and intellectual property providing maintenance for our software and hardware and providing design and methodology services we principally utilize three license types subscription term and perpetual the different license types provide a customer with different rights to use our products such as i the right to access new technology ii the duration of the license and iii payment terms customer decisions regarding these aspects of license transactions determine the license type timing of revenue recognition and potential future business activity for example if a customer chooses a fixed term of use this will result in either a subscription or term license a business implication of that decision is that at the expiration of the license period the customer must decide whether to continue using the technology and therefore renew the license agreement because larger customers generally use products from two or more of our five product groups rarely will a large customer completely terminate its relationship with us at expiration of the license see 

34 “critical accounting estimates” above for additional discussion of license types and timing of revenue recognition 

  to the extent a customer obtains rights to remix to new technology or more flexible payment terms revenue is recognized over the life of the agreement this distinction is a critical determinant of revenue recognition for example a 30 million 3year product subscription license would result in 10 million of revenue recognized per year or 250000 per quarter however a 30 million 3year product term license assuming equal or near equal payments and no rights to new technology would result in 30 million of revenue recognized upon delivery which is generally in the first quarter of the arrangement and no revenue recognized in succeeding quarters 

  with each succeeding quarter in which the number of product licenses where revenue recognition is deferred increases our revenue from backlog also increases product revenue recognized from backlog comprised approximately 68 of total product revenue in 2004 60 in 2003 and 45 in 2002 as long as customers continue to prefer subscription licenses we expect that revenue from backlog will increase and our revenue will be less susceptible to shortterm fluctuations in volume because our model leads to a substantial portion of our revenue being recognized over multiple periods we do not believe that pricing volatility has been a material component of the change in our product revenue from period to period and we have not analyzed changes in pricing from one period to the next 

  the amount of product revenue in future periods will depend among other things on the terms and timing of our contract renewals or additional product sales with existing customers the size of such transactions or renewals and sales to new customers product revenue in any period is also affected by the extent to which customers prefer subscription term or perpetual licenses and the extent to which contracts contain flexible payment terms revenue is also affected by changes in the extent to which existing contracts contain flexible payment terms and changes in license types eg subscription to term for existing customers contract renewals and consequently product revenues are also affected by the competitiveness of our products 

  during 2005 we plan to continue optimizing our operations in the first quarter of 2005 we announced a plan of restructuring that will reduce our workforce by approximately 200 employees this will result in an estimated restructuring and other expense of approximately 180 million to 200 million in 2005 we expect ongoing annual savings of approximately 300 million related to this plan of restructuring 

  on january 12 2005 we announced that we had signed a definitive agreement to acquire verisity ltd or verisity a mountain view californiabased provider of verification process automation solutions if completed the merger will be accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 

  under the terms of the agreement upon satisfaction of the closing conditions contained therein including receipt of certain governmental and verisity shareholder approvals we will acquire verisity in an allcash transaction for approximately 3150 million to 3350 million which consists of payments to stockholders and acquisition costs upon closing of the acquisition verisity stockholders will receive 12 in cash in exchange for each outstanding share of verisity stock 

revenue and revenue mix by product group 

  we analyze our software and hardware businesses by product group combining revenues for both product and maintenance because of their interrelationship we have formulated a design solution strategy that combines our design technologies into “platforms” which are included in the various product groups described below we introduced our first platform in september 2002 the data described below for product groups for periods before a platform was introduced aggregates the revenues from the individual products associated with that particular platform 

  our product groups are 

  functional verification products in this group which include the incisive tm functional verification platform are used to verify that the high level logical specification of an integrated circuit design is correct 

35   digital ic design products in this group which include the encounter tm digital ic design platform are used to accurately convert the highlevel logical specification of a digital integrated circuit into a detailed physical blueprint of the integrated circuit which is used for creation of the photomasks used in chip manufacture 

  custom ic design our custom design products which include the virtuoso® custom design platform are used for integrated circuits that must be designed at the transistor level including analog radio frequency memories high performance digital blocks and standard cell libraries 

  design for manufacturing included in this product group are our physical verification and analysis products these products are used to analyze and verify that the physical blueprint of the integrated circuit has been constructed correctly and can be manufactured successfully 

  system interconnect this product group consists of our printed circuit board and integrated circuit package design products including the allegro® system interconnect design platform which enables consistent codesign of integrated circuits ic packages and printed circuit boards 

revenue by year 

  the table below shows our revenue for the years ended 2004 2003 and 2002 

 2004 compared to 2003 

  product revenue was higher in 2004 as compared to 2003 primarily because of increased revenue from licenses for digital ic and system interconnect products and sales of certain intellectual property services revenue increased in 2004 due to an increase in customer spending for design services as the electronics industry experienced some recovery from the economic downturn of 2002 and 2003 

2003 compared to 2002 

  product revenue was lower in 2003 as compared to 2002 due to the shift to more ratable licenses and lower sales volume services revenue was lower in 2003 as compared to 2002 due to a decrease in customer spending for design services as a result of the economic downturn experienced in the electronics industry at that time 

36 revenue by product group 

  the following table shows for 2004 2003 and 2002 the percentage of product and related maintenance revenue contributed by each of our five product groups and services and other 

   during 2004 we recognized 110 million of revenue from the sale of intellectual property or ip this sale of ip is included in services and other in the preceding table and in product revenue in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations 

revenue by geography 

 revenue by geography as a percent of total revenue 

   the rate of revenue change varies geographically due to differences in the timing and extent of term license renewals for existing customers in those regions in addition both our domestic and international businesses have been affected by the revenue trends discussed above in this section entitled “results of operations” 

  changes in foreign currency exchange rates caused our revenue to increase by 160 million in 2004 as compared to 2003 and to increase by 188 million in 2003 as compared to 2002 primarily due to 

37 strengthening of the japanese yen in relation to the us dollar additional information about revenue and other financial information by geography can be found in note 19 to our consolidated financial statements 

cost of revenue 

 cost of revenue as a percent of related revenue 

   cost of product includes costs associated with the sale or lease of our hardware and licensing of our software products cost of product primarily includes the cost of employee salaries and benefits amortization of intangible assets directly related to cadence products the cost of technical documentation and royalties payable to thirdparty vendors cost of product associated with our cadence verification acceleration or cva hardware products also includes materials assembly labor and overhead these additional manufacturing costs make our cost of hardware product higher as a percentage of revenue than our cost of software product 

  a summary of cost of product is as follows 

 2004 compared to 2003 

  cost of product increased 150 million in 2004 as compared to 2003 primarily due to an increase of 180 million in cost of goods sold for our hardware business resulting from increased sales of our hardware products and an increase of 50 million in amortization of intangible assets partially offset by a 44 million decrease in royalty expenses and a 36 million decrease in amortized software costs 

  cost of product in the future will depend primarily upon the actual mix of hardware and software product contracts in any given period and the degree to which we license and incorporate thirdparty technology in our products licensed or sold in any given period 

  cost of services primarily includes employee salary and benefits costs to maintain the infrastructure necessary to manage a services organization and provisions for contract losses if any cost of services decreased 22 million in 2004 as compared to 2003 primarily due to a decrease in salary and benefit costs resulting from decreases in employees in our services business services gross margin as a percentage of services revenue increased during 2004 as compared to 2003 due to increased services revenues and decreased cost of services 

38   cost of maintenance includes the cost of customer services such as hotline and onsite support production employees and documentation of maintenance updates cost of maintenance revenue decreased 35 million in 2004 as compared to 2003 due to a 23 million decrease in salary and benefit costs and a 12 million decrease in information technology facilities and general operating expenses 

  2003 compared to 2002 

  cost of product decreased 313 million in 2003 as compared to 2002 primarily due to an 189 million reduction in amortized software costs an 83 million decrease in royalties expense a 93 million decrease in inventory writeoffs and a 22 million decrease in acquisitionrelated writeoffs the decreases were partially offset by an increase in amortization of acquired intangibles of 138 million during 2003 

  cost of services decreased 215 million in 2003 as compared to 2002 primarily due to decreases in employee salary and benefit costs resulting from our reduction of services professionals in connection with our restructuring actions initiated in 2002 and 2003 as a result services gross margin as a percentage of services revenue increased during 2003 as compared to 2002 

  cost of maintenance decreased 86 million in 2003 as compared to 2002 primarily due to a decrease in employee salary and benefit costs resulting from a decrease in employee headcount 

operating expenses 

 operating expenses as a percent of total revenue 

 operating expense summary 

  2004 compared to 2003 

  operating expenses increased 113 million during 2004 as compared to 2003 primarily due to a 318 million increase in employee salaries and benefits and related costs primarily due to bonuses earned in 2004 that had not been earned in 2003 this increase was partially offset by a 132 million decrease in depreciation and amortization expense a 74 million decrease in outside services and a 72 million decrease in commission payments to innotech corporation or innotech as a result of our acquisition from innotech in 2003 of distribution rights to certain of its customers 

  foreign currency exchange rates increased operating expenses by 109 million in 2004 as compared to 2003 primarily due to the strengthening of the euro british pound and japanese yen in relation to the us dollar 

  we expect our operating expenses to increase in 2005 as compared to 2004 due to our pending acquisition of verisity ltd 

39   2003 compared to 2002 

  operating expenses declined 950 million during 2003 as compared to 2002 as a result of the cost reductions from our 2003 and 2002 restructuring activities described more fully below in “restructuring and other charges” 

  foreign currency exchange rates increased operating expenses by 113 million in 2003 as compared to 2002 primarily due to the strengthening of the euro and british pound in relation to the us dollar 

marketing and sales 

  2004 compared to 2003 

  marketing and sales expenses decreased 07 million during 2004 as compared to 2003 primarily due to a 72 million decrease in commission payments to innotech as a result of our acquisition from innotech of distribution rights to certain of its customers and a 31 million reduction in depreciation related to prior restructuring activities this decrease was partially offset by a 77 million increase in employee salaries and benefits and related costs and a 22 million increase in marketing program costs 

  2003 compared to 2002 

  marketing and sales expenses decreased 755 million during 2003 as compared to 2002 primarily due to a 278 million decrease in employee salaries and benefits and related costs resulting from our restructuring activities a 161 million decrease in commission costs a 126 million decrease in outside services costs and a 41 million decrease in marketing program costs salary benefits and commission costs declined due to reduced headcount in the sales and marketing organizations outside services costs declined due to decreased commission payments to innotech and a reduction in costs incurred for outside contractors and consultants 

research and development 

  2004 compared to 2003 

  research and development expense increased 112 million during 2004 as compared to 2003 primarily due to a 214 million increase in employee salaries and benefits and related costs resulting from an increase in employees due to business acquisitions and increased staffing to support strategic technologies this increase was partially offset by a 74 million decrease in expenses related to our use of outside services and a 32 million decrease in costs associated with outsourced research and development projects 

  2003 compared to 2002 

  the increase in research and development expense of 137 million for 2003 as compared to 2002 was primarily due to a 141 million increase in employee salaries and benefits and related costs resulting from an increase in employees due to business acquisitions and increased staffing to support strategic technologies and an 189 million reduction in capitalized development costs partially offset by an 115 million reduction in costs related to outsourced services and research and development projects as a result of the restructuring activities and a 56 million decrease in expenses related to our use of other outside services 

general and administrative 

  2004 compared to 2003 

  general and administrative expense increased 08 million in 2004 as compared to 2003 primarily due to a 45 million increase in employee salaries and benefits and related costs and a 26 million increase in professional fees related to our annual audit and sarbanesoxley section 404 compliance this increase was partially offset by a 26 million decrease in legal expenses a 24 million decrease in bad debt expense and a 13 million decrease in insurance expense 

40   2003 compared to 2002 

  general and administrative expense decreased 332 million in 2003 as compared to 2002 primarily due to a 166 million decrease in legal expense a 93 million decrease in salary and benefit costs in connection with our restructuring activities and a 22 million decrease in bad debt expense the allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of total receivables declined in 2003 as compared to 2002 because writeoffs continued to decline and because of additional reductions in the percentage of receivables past due there were no significant changes in our collection policies or payment terms from 2002 to 2003 

amortization of acquired intangibles 

   2004 compared to 2003 

  amortization of acquired intangibles decreased 69 million in 2004 as compared to 2003 primarily due to an 114 million decrease in the amortization of acquired intangibles reflecting the full amortization of intangible assets from prior year acquisitions partially offset by increases of 56 million in amortization of acquired intangibles in connection with our previously completed acquisitions we expect an increase in the amortization of acquired intangibles in 2005 due to the pending acquisition of verisity ltd as described more fully in note 20 to our consolidated financial statements 

  2003 compared to 2002 

  amortization of acquired intangibles increased 88 million in 2003 as compared to 2002 primarily due to a 108 million increase in amortization of acquired intangibles in connection with our previously completed acquisitions 

amortization of deferred stock compensation 

   we amortize deferred stock compensation related to fixed awards using the straightline method over the period that the stock options and restricted stock vest we recognize stock compensation expense related to variable awards using an accelerated method over the period that the stock options and restricted stock are earned 

  2004 compared to 2003 

  amortization of deferred stock compensation decreased 97 million in 2004 as compared to 2003 due to a 246 million decrease in the amortization of deferred stock compensation primarily related to our previously completed acquisitions this decrease was partially offset by a 149 million increase in the amortization of deferred stock compensation primarily related to incentive stock grants we expect that amortization of deferred stock compensation will increase in 2005 due to increased incentive stock grants during 2004 and our adoption of sfas no 123r in our third quarter of 2005 as described more fully in “new accounting standards” below 

  2003 compared to 2002 

  amortization of deferred stock compensation decreased 29 million in 2003 as compared to 2002 primarily due to a 148 million decrease in the amortization of deferred stock compensation related to our previously completed acquisitions this decrease was partially offset by a 43 million increase in the 

41 amortization of deferred stock compensation related to verplex and a 22 million increase in the amortization of deferred stock compensation related to the marktomarket of options granted to consultants 

restructuring and other charges 

  we have initiated a separate plan of restructuring in each year since 2001 in an effort to reduce operating expenses and improve operating margins and cash flows 

  the restructuring plans initiated in 2001 2002 and 2003 or the 2001 restructuring 2002 restructuring and 2003 restructuring respectively were intended to decrease costs by reducing workforce and consolidating facilities and resources to align our cost structure with expected revenues the 2001 and 2002 restructurings primarily related to our design services business and certain other business or infrastructure groups throughout the world the 2003 restructuring was targeted at reducing costs throughout the company 

  during 2004 we commenced a new plan of restructuring or the 2004 restructuring which was also intended to decrease costs and realize efficiencies by reducing workforce and resources throughout the company to align our cost structure with expected revenues 

  a summary of restructuring and other charges by plan of restructuring for fiscal years 2004 2003 and 2002 is as follows 

   frequently asset impairments are based on significant estimates and assumptions particularly regarding remaining useful life and utilization rates we may incur other charges in the future if management determines that the useful life or utilization of certain longlived assets has been reduced 

  closure and space reduction costs included payments required under leases less any applicable estimated sublease income after the properties were abandoned lease buyout costs and costs to maintain facilities during the abandonment period to determine the lease loss which is the loss after our cost recovery efforts from subleasing a building certain assumptions were made related to the time period over which the relevant building would remain vacant and sublease terms including sublease rates and contractual common area charges 

  as of january 1 2005 our best estimate of the accrued lease loss related to all worldwide restructuring activities initiated since 2001 is 337 million this amount will be adjusted in the future based upon changes 

42 in the assumptions used to estimate the lease loss the lease loss could range as high as 532 million if sublease rental rates decrease in applicable markets or if it takes longer than currently expected to find a suitable tenant to sublease the facilities since 2001 we have recorded facilities consolidation charges under the 2001 through 2004 restructurings of 852 million related to reducing space in or the closing of 34 sites of which 24 have been vacated and 10 have been downsized 

  because the restructuring charges and related benefits are derived from management’s estimates made during the formulation of the restructurings based on thencurrently available information our restructuring activities may not achieve the benefits anticipated on the timetable or at the level contemplated demand for our products and services and ultimately our future financial performance is difficult to predict with any degree of certainty accordingly additional actions including further restructuring of our operations may be required in the future 

  the following is further discussion of the activity under each restructuring plan 

  during 2005 we plan to continue optimizing our operations in the first quarter of 2005 we announced a plan of restructuring that will reduce our workforce by approximately 200 employees this will result in an estimated restructuring and other expense of approximately 180 million to 200 million in 2005 we expect ongoing annual savings of approximately 300 million related to this plan of restructuring 

  2004 restructuring  — the 2004 restructuring resulted in the termination of approximately 130 employees costs resulting from this restructuring included severance payments severancerelated benefits and outplacement services all terminations and termination benefits associated with this restructuring were communicated to the affected employees prior to january 1 2005 with all termination benefits expected to be paid by july 2 2005 

  we project annualized savings in employee salary and benefits costs of approximately 200 million resulting from employee terminations under the 2004 restructuring 

  other expenses of 94 million related to the abandonment of thirdparty software purchased and integrated an into an internaluse software application during 2004 we replaced this thirdparty purchased software with internally developed technology upon deployment of the internally developed software we recorded a charge to reduce the value of the thirdparty software product and implementation costs to zero 

  2003 restructuring  — during 2004 we recorded a net credit of 21 million related to the 2003 restructuring this net credit is comprised of a 28 million credit associated with assetrelated charges and a 08 million severance and benefits credit partially offset by 15 million of additional excess facilities charges 

  the net 28 million assetrelated credit was associated with the reversal of an accrual of approximately 46 million for an expected payment to a government agency because we have determined it is not probable we will have any future liability this reversal was partially offset by a 12 million accrual for fees related to headcount reductions at a foreign facility we also reversed 08 million of the severancerelated accrual related to payroll taxes benefits and outplacement services in excess of the remaining expected obligation 

  we incurred excess facilities expenses of 15 million in the year ended january 1 2005 related to the 2003 restructuring these expenses were primarily comprised of additional expenses incurred for facilities included in the 2003 restructuring but vacated during fiscal 2004 expenses also included contract termination charges and expenses incurred to sublease facilities and storage and disposal charges associated with facilities vacated as part of the 2003 restructuring 

  we expect to incur an additional 40 million to 60 million of future costs in connection with the 2003 restructuring primarily for facilitiesrelated charges which will be expensed as incurred the actual amount of additional costs incurred could vary depending on changes in market conditions and the timing of these restructuring activities 

  2002 restructuring  — during 2004 we recorded a net credit of 16 million related to the 2002 restructuring this net credit is comprised of the reversal of 12 million of accrued contract termination costs 

43 not incurred and 04 million of the severance and benefits accrual in excess of the remaining expected obligation partially offset by 01 million of additional excess facilities charges 

  2001 restructuring  — we recorded facilitiesrelated expenses of 06 million during 2004 primarily due to changes in lease loss estimates and costs associated with facilities vacated as part of the 2001 restructuring plan 

writeoff of acquired inprocess research and development 

  upon consummation of an acquisition we immediately charge to expense any acquired inprocess research and development that has not yet reached technological feasibility and has no alternative future use the value assigned to acquired inprocess research and development is determined by identifying research projects in areas for which technological feasibility has not been established the values are determined by estimating costs to develop the acquired inprocess research and development into commercially viable products estimating the resulting net cash flows from such projects and discounting the net cash flows back to their present value the discount rates utilized include a factor that reflects the uncertainty surrounding successful development of the acquired inprocess research and development 

  described below are the writeoffs of acquired inprocess research and development charges in 2004 2003 and 2002 

   we expect an increase in writeoff of acquired inprocess research and development in 2005 as compared to 2004 assuming our pending acquisition of verisity ltd is completed 

44   described below is a summary of inprocess research and development acquired during 2004 2003 and 2002 as of january 1 2005 

 interest expense 

 2004 compared to 2003 

  interest expense increased 12 million in 2004 as compared to 2003 primarily due to an increase of 18 million in amortization expense related to the costs associated with the issuance of our zero coupon zero yield senior convertible notes or the notes in august 2003 an increase of 13 million in imputed interest on acquisitionrelated payments which occur over time partially offset by a decrease of 19 million in interest expense related to our credit facilities that were terminated in 2003 after the issuance of the notes 

2003 compared to 2002 

  interest expense increased 22 million in 2003 as compared to 2002 primarily due to an increase of 17 million in imputed interest on acquisitionrelated payments which occur over time and an increase of 08 million of amortization expense related to the costs associated with the issuance of our notes partially offset by a decrease of 03 million in interest expense related to our credit facilities that were terminated in 2003 after the issuance of the notes 

45 other expense net 

  other expense net for the years ended 2004 2003 and 2002 is as follows 

   in 2004 the other income of 42 million is comprised of 125 million of gains on the sale of investments and 04 million of other income net offset by 42 million of impairment of investments 25 million of investment management fees paid to manage the telos venture partnerships described under “liquidity and capital resources” below and 20 million of losses on the sale of receivables in 2003 the other expense of 104 million is comprised of 48 million of impairment of investments 50 million of losses on the sale of receivables and 06 million of other expense net in 2002 the other expense of 87 million is comprised of 141 million of impairment of investments 151 million of losses on the sale of receivables 249 million of gains on the sale of investments and 44 million of other expense net we expect our equity in loss from investments net to decrease in 2005 as a result of the adoption of eitf no 0214 as more fully described in note 6 to our consolidated financial statements 

provision for income taxes 

  the provision for income taxes and the effective tax rates for 2004 2003 and 2002 are as follows 

 2004 compared to 2003 

  the income before provision for income taxes resulted in a provision for income taxes in 2004 compared to a benefit for income taxes in 2003 the 2004 provision for income taxes has a greater benefit from foreign income that is taxed at a lower rate than the us federal statutory rate when compared to 2003 

2003 compared to 2002 

  the loss before provision for income taxes resulted in a benefit for income taxes in 2003 compared to a provision for income taxes in 2002 the 2003 benefit has a greater detriment from nondeductible amortization of stock compensation expense partially offset by a greater benefit from foreign income that is taxed at a lower rate than the us federal statutory rate in comparison to 2002 

outlook for 2005 

  excluding the impact of the potential acquisition of verisity ltd we are currently projecting an increase in our effective income tax rate for 2005 primarily due to a reduced benefit from foreign income taxed at a lower rate than the us federal statutory rate in comparison to 2004 we are not yet in a position to reasonably estimate the effective income tax rate for 2005 as we are currently studying the impact of certain new tax rules in the american jobs creation act of 2004 or ajca the pending adoption of sfas no 123r and the completion of our pending acquisition of verisity ltd 

46   the total valuation allowance on deferred tax assets increased by 06 million during 2004 as of january 1 2005 the valuation allowance is 78 million and is related to deferred tax assets for certain states where realization is not judged to be likely 

  as of january 1 2005 we had total net deferred tax assets of approximately 1068 million realization of the deferred tax assets will depend on generating sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character prior to the expiration of certain net operating loss capital loss and tax credit carryforwards although realization is not assured we believe it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets will be realized the amount of the net deferred tax assets however could be reduced or increased in the near term if actual facts including the estimate of future taxable income differ from those estimated 

  we currently intend to indefinitely reinvest our undistributed foreign earnings and accordingly have not provided for the us or foreign taxes that would be incurred if such earnings were repatriated to the us the ajca enacted on october 22 2004 created a temporary incentive for us corporations to repatriate accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries by providing an 85 dividends received deduction for certain qualifying dividends the deduction is subject to a number of limitations although no decision has been made regarding repatriation of foreign earnings under the ajca we may elect to apply this provision to qualifying earnings repatriated during fiscal 2005 we are currently evaluating the merits of repatriating funds under the ajca and expect to complete this evaluation by october 1 2005 the range of possible amounts that we are considering for repatriation under this provision is between zero and 5500 million we have historically considered undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries to be indefinitely reinvested and accordingly have not provided for income taxes on these undistributed earnings if we decide to repatriate foreign earnings in a future period we will be required to recognize income tax expense related to the federal state local and foreign income taxes that we would incur on the repatriated earnings when the decision is made we are currently unable to reasonably estimate the possible range of income tax effects of such repatriation 

  the irs and other tax authorities regularly examine our income tax returns in november 2003 the irs completed its field examination of our federal income tax returns for the tax years 1997 through 1999 and issued a revenue agent’s report or the rar in which the irs proposes to assess an aggregate tax deficiency for the threeyear period of approximately 1430 million plus interest which interest will accrue until the matter is resolved this interest is compounded daily at rates published by the irs which rates have been between four and nine percent since 1997 and are adjusted quarterly the irs may also make similar claims for years subsequent to 1999 in future examinations the rar is not a final statutory notice of deficiency and we have protested certain of the proposed adjustments with the appeals office of the irs where the matter is presently being considered the most significant of the disputed adjustments relates to transfer pricing arrangements that we have with a foreign subsidiary we believe that the proposed irs adjustments are inconsistent with the applicable tax laws and that we have meritorious defenses to the proposed adjustments we intend to challenge these proposed adjustments vigorously 

  the irs is currently examining our federal income tax returns for the tax years 2000 through 2002 

  significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes we have assessed the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations including the current irs examination and the irs rar for tax years 1997 through 1999 however the ultimate outcome of tax examinations cannot be predicted with certainty including the total amount payable or the timing of any such payments upon resolution of these issues in addition we cannot be certain that such amount will not be materially different than that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals should the irs or other tax authorities assess additional taxes as a result of a current or a future examination we may be required to record charges to operations in future periods that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows in the period or periods recorded 

47 disclosures about market risk 

interest rate risk 

  our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our shortterm investment portfolio while we are exposed to interest rate fluctuations in many of the world’s leading industrialized countries our interest income and expense is most sensitive to fluctuations in the general level of us interest rates in this regard changes in us interest rates affect the interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents shortterm and longterm investments and costs associated with foreign currency hedges 

  we invest in high quality credit issuers and by policy limit the amount of our credit exposure to any one issuer as part of our policy our first priority is to reduce the risk of principal loss consequently we seek to preserve our invested funds by limiting default risk market risk and reinvestment risk we mitigate default risk by investing in only high quality credit securities that we believe to have low credit risk and by positioning our portfolio to respond appropriately to a significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor the shortterm interestbearing portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity 

  the table below presents the carrying value and related weighted average interest rates for our interestbearing instruments all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase are considered to be cash equivalents investments with maturities between three and 12 months are considered to be shortterm investments held to maturity investments with maturities greater than 12 months are considered longterm investments the carrying value of our interestbearing instruments approximated fair value at january 1 2005 

 foreign currency risk 

  our operations include transactions in foreign currencies and therefore we benefit from a weaker dollar and we are adversely affected by a stronger dollar relative to major currencies worldwide the primary effect of foreign currency transactions on our results of operations from a weakening us dollar is an increase in revenue offset by a smaller increase in expenses conversely the primary effect of foreign currency transactions on our results of operations from a strengthening us dollar is a reduction in revenue offset by a smaller reduction in expenses foreign currency fluctuations positively impacted our income by 37 million in 2004 as compared to 2003 and 26 million in 2003 as compared to 2002 

  we enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts with financial institutions to protect against currency exchange risks associated with existing assets and liabilities a foreign currency forward exchange contract acts as a hedge by increasing in value when underlying assets decrease in value or underlying liabilities increase in value due to changes in foreign exchange rates conversely a foreign currency forward exchange contract decreases in value when underlying assets increase in value or underlying liabilities decrease in value due to changes in foreign exchange rates these forward contracts are not designated as accounting hedges under sfas no 133 and therefore the unrealized gains and losses are recognized in other expense net in advance of the actual foreign currency cash flows with the fair value of these forward contracts being recorded as accrued liabilities 

48   our policy governing hedges of foreign currency risk does not allow us to use forward contracts for trading purposes our forward contracts generally have maturities of 180 days or less recognized gains and losses with respect to our current hedging activities will ultimately depend on how accurately we are able to match the amount of currency forward exchange contracts with underlying asset and liability exposures 

  the table below provides information as of january 1 2005 about our forward foreign currency contracts the information is provided in us dollar equivalent amounts the table presents the notional amounts at contract exchange rates and the weighted average contractual foreign currency exchange rates expressed as units of the foreign currency per us dollar which in some cases may not be the market convention for quoting a particular currency all of these forward contracts mature prior to march 18 2005 

   while we actively monitor our foreign currency risks there can be no assurance that our foreign currency hedging activities will substantially offset the impact of fluctuations in currency exchange rates on our results of operations cash flows and financial position 

equity price risk 

  in august 2003 we issued 4200 million principal amount of the notes to two initial purchasers in a private offering for resale to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to sec rule 144a for which we received net proceeds of approximately 4064 million after transaction fees of approximately 136 million the notes are convertible into our common stock initially at a conversion price of 1565 per share which would result in an aggregate of 268 million shares issued upon conversion subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events we may redeem for cash all or any part of the notes on or after august 15 2008 for 10000 of the principal amount the holders may require us to repurchase for cash all or any portion of their notes on august 15 2008 for 10025 of the principal amount on august 15 2013 for 10000 of the principal amount or on august 15 2018 for 10000 of the principal amount the notes do not contain restrictive financial covenants 

  each 1000 of principal of the notes will initially be convertible into 63879 shares of our common stock subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events holders of the notes may convert their notes prior to maturity only if 1 the price of our common stock reaches 2269 during certain periods of time specified in the notes 2 specified corporate transactions occur 3 the notes have been called for redemption or 4 the trading price of the notes falls below a certain threshold as of january 1 2005 none of the conditions allowing holders of the notes to convert had been met 

  in addition in the event of a significant change in our corporate ownership or structure the holders may require us to repurchase all or any portion of their notes for 100 of the principal amount 

49   concurrently with the issuance of the notes we entered into convertible notes hedge transactions with jp morgan chase bank whereby we have the option to purchase up to 268 million shares of our common stock at a price of 1565 per share these options expire on august 15 2008 and must be settled in net shares the cost of the convertible notes hedge transactions to us was approximately 1346 million as of january 1 2005 the estimated fair value of the convertible notes hedge transactions was 1008 million 

  in addition we sold to jp morgan chase bank warrants to purchase up to 268 million shares of our common stock at a price of 2308 per share the warrants expire on various dates from february 2008 through may 2008 and must be settled in net shares we received approximately 564 million in cash proceeds for the sales of these warrants as of january 1 2005 the estimated fair value of the sold warrants was 322 million 

  for additional discussion of the notes see “liquidity and capital resources” below 

  we have a portfolio of equity investments that includes marketable equity securities and nonmarketable equity securities our equity investments primarily are made in privatelyheld companies either as direct investments or through our telos venture partnerships described under “liquidity and capital resources” below from time to time we make cash investments in companies with distinctive technologies that are potentially strategically important to us 

  the fair value of our portfolio of marketable equity securities which are included in shortterm investments in the accompanying consolidated financial statements was 359 million as of january 1 2005 and 336 million as of january 3 2004 while we actively monitor these investments we do not currently engage in any hedging activities to reduce or eliminate equity price risk with respect to these equity investments accordingly we could lose all or part of our investment portfolio of marketable equity securities if there is an adverse change in the market prices of the companies we invest in 

  our investments in nonmarketable equity securities would be negatively affected by an adverse change in equity market prices although the impact cannot be directly quantified such a change or any negative change in the financial performance or prospects of the companies whose nonmarketable securities we own would harm the ability of these companies to raise additional capital and the likelihood of our being able to realize any gains or return of our investments through liquidity events such as initial public offerings acquisitions and private sales these types of investments involve a high degree of risk and there can be no assurance that any company we invest in will grow or will be successful accordingly we could lose all or part of our investment 

  our investments in nonmarketable equity securities had a carrying amount of 457 million as of january 1 2005 and 533 million as of january 3 2004 if we determine that an otherthantemporary decline in fair value exists for a nonmarketable equity security we write down the investment to its fair value and record the related writedown as an investment loss in our consolidated statements of operations 

50 liquidity and capital resources 

 cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments 

  during the fourth quarter of 2004 we reclassified auction rate securities of 754 million as of january 3 2004 and 150 million as of december 28 2002 from cash and cash equivalents to shortterm investments on our consolidated balance sheets we have reclassified the purchases and sales of these auction rate securities in our consolidated statements of cash flows which decreased cash flows from investing activities by 604 million for the year ended january 3 2004 and 150 million for the year ended december 28 2002 

  at january 1 2005 our principal sources of liquidity consisted of 5930 million of cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments as compared to 4184 million at january 3 2004 and 3956 million at december 28 2002 the primary sources of our cash in 2004 and 2003 were customer payments under software licenses and from the sale or lease of our hardware products payments for the provision of design and methodology services proceeds from the issuance of convertible notes in 2003 proceeds from the sale of receivables and from the exercise of stock options and common stock purchases under our employee stock purchase plans our primary uses of cash in 2004 and 2003 consisted of payments relating to payroll product services and other operating expenses taxes the hedge for our convertible notes to manage equity dilution purchases of treasury stock and business acquisitions 

net working capital 

  at january 1 2005 we had net working capital of 5210 million as compared with 3603 million at january 3 2004 and 2543 million at december 28 2002 the increase in net working capital from 2003 to 2004 was primarily due to the increase in cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments of 1746 million an increase in receivables net of 354 million and an increase in prepaid expense and other of 141 million partially offset by an increase of accounts payable and accrued liabilities of 345 million and an increase in deferred revenue of 325 million 

  the increase in net working capital from 2002 to 2003 was primarily due to a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of 519 million an increase in receivables net of 347 million and an increase in cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments of 228 million partially offset by an increase in deferred revenue of 307 million 

cash flows from operating activities 

  our cash flows from operating activities are significantly influenced by the payment terms set forth in our license agreements for a term license in which revenue is recognized upon delivery payment of a substantial portion of the fee must be paid in the first year of the license our installment contracts that do not include a substantial up front payment have payment periods that are equal to or less than the term of the licenses and 

51 the payments are collected quarterly in equal or nearly equal installments when evaluated over the entire term of the arrangement 

  we have entered into agreements whereby we may transfer qualifying accounts receivable to certain financing institutions on a nonrecourse basis these transfers are recorded as sales and accounted for in accordance with sfas no 140 “accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities” during 2004 we transferred accounts receivable totaling 301 million which approximated fair value to financing institutions on a nonrecourse basis as compared to 874 million in 2003 and 1820 million in 2002 

  provision for sales returns is accounted for as a reduction of revenue provision for sales returns decreased 85 million in 2004 as compared to 2003 and increased 12 million in 2003 as compared to 2002 

  2004 compared to 2003 

  net cash provided by operating activities increased by 2015 million to 3725 million during 2004 as compared to 1710 million net cash provided by operating activities during 2003 the increase from 2003 to 2004 is primarily due to an increase in net income of 920 million an increase in cash received from installment contract receivables of 1285 million a decrease in payments associated with accounts payable and accrued liabilities of 1087 million partially offset by a decrease in proceeds from the sale of receivables of 573 million and a decrease of cash collected on accounts receivable net of 480 million 

  2003 compared to 2002 

  net cash provided by operating activities decreased by 1767 million to 1710 million during 2003 as compared to 3477 million net cash provided by operating activities during 2002 the decrease from 2002 to 2003 is primarily due to a reduction in net income of 779 million a decrease in deferred income taxes of 359 million and a 265 million reduction in writeoff of acquired inprocess research and development 

cash flows from investing activities 

  our primary investing activities consisted of business acquisitions purchasing property plant and equipment purchasing software licenses purchasing technology and investing in venture capital partnership and equity investments which combined represented 2039 million of cash used for investing activities in 2004 as compared to 3384 million in 2003 and 1754 million in 2002 

  as part of our overall investment strategy we are a limited partner in three venture capital funds telos venture partners lp or telos i telos venture partners ii lp or telos ii and telos venture partners iii lp or telos iii telos i telos ii and telos iii are referred to collectively as telos 

  we and certain of our deferred compensation trusts are the sole limited partners of telos i and telos iii and we are the sole limited partner of telos ii the partnership agreements governing telos i telos ii and telos iii which are substantially the same require us to meet capital calls principally for the purpose of funding investments that are recommended by the applicable telos general partner and approved by the telos advisory committee as being consistent with the partnership’s limitations and stated purposes the telos general partner which is not affiliated with us manages the partnerships and may be removed by us without cause for all three partnerships the advisory committee is comprised solely of the members of the venture committee of our board of directors the current members of which are our chairman of the board of directors and two independent members of our board of directors 

  as of january 1 2005 we had contributed 963 million to these partnerships and are contractually committed to contribute to them up to an additional 691 million actual future contributions will depend upon the level of investments made by telos our commitments expire concurrently with the termination date of each partnership which in the case of telos i is december 31 2005 in the case of telos ii is july 3 2012 and in the case of telos iii is june 1 2012 our investments in the telos partnerships are recorded in other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 

52   2004 compared to 2003 

  net cash used for investing activities decreased by 1713 million to 2150 million during 2004 as compared to 3863 million net cash used for investing activities during 2003 the decrease from 2003 to 2004 is primarily due to a decrease of 671 million of net cash paid in business acquisitions a decrease of 170 million of investments in venture capital partnership and equity investments a decrease of 293 million in purchases of technology a decrease of 211 million in purchases of property plant and equipment an increase of 986 million of sales of shortterm investments and an increase of proceeds from the sale of available for sale securities and longterm investments of 149 million partially offset by an increase of 712 million of purchases of shortterm investments 

  during 2003 we received 91 million in cash from the saleleaseback of certain equipment we will make aggregate payments under the resulting operating leases of 91 million over the three to five year life of the operating leases 

  2003 compared to 2002 

  net cash used for investing activities increased by 2352 million to 3863 million during 2003 as compared to 1511 million net cash used for investing activities during 2002 the increase from 2002 to 2003 is primarily due to an increase of 1476 million of net cash paid in business acquisitions an increase of 4487 million in purchases of shortterm investments a decrease of 494 million of proceeds from the sale of availableforsale securities an increase of 329 million of investments in venture capital partnership and equity investments an increase of 293 million of purchases of technology partially offset by an increase in proceeds from sales of shortterm investments of 4033 million a reduction in purchases of property plant and equipment of 423 million a reduction of purchases of availableforsale securities of 101 million and a reduction of purchases of software licenses of 45 million 

cash flows from financing activities 

  2004 compared to 2003 

  net cash used for financing activities was 211 million in 2004 as compared to net cash provided by financing activities of 1492 million in 2003 a change of 1625 million in 2004 our primary use of cash from financing activities was the repurchase of 941 million of treasury stock as compared to 2138 million in 2003 as of january 1 2005 the remaining repurchase authorization under our stock repurchase program totaled 1230 million our primary source of cash from financing activities was 753 million from the issuance of common stock upon exercise of stock options and employee stock purchase program as compared to 866 million in 2003 in addition during 2003 we issued 4200 million of convertible notes and received proceeds from the sale of common stock warrants and purchased convertible notes hedges for 1346 million 

  2003 compared to 2002 

  net cash provided by financing activities increased by 2033 million from 2002 due to the issuance of our convertibles notes and sale of common stock warrants noted above partially offset by an increase of 320 million in the purchase of treasury stock 

  we expect to continue our financing activity and may use cash reserves to repurchase stock under our stock repurchase program we may also consider additional hedging transactions if opportunities become available 

other factors affecting liquidity and capital resources 

  we provide for us income taxes on the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries unless these earnings are considered indefinitely invested outside of the united states as of january 1 2005 it is our intention to continue to indefinitely reinvest our undistributed foreign earnings 

53   on october 22 2004 the ajca was signed into law a key provision of the ajca is a onetime incentive to repatriate foreign earnings at a reduced effective tax rate a company must meet several requirements to qualify for the incentive and we are currently studying the impact of the ajca’s repatriation provisions on our plans to indefinitely reinvest our foreign earnings if we determine that we will dividend all or a portion of our undistributed foreign earnings we will potentially incur additional foreign and us federal state and local income taxes in the period the dividend is made as of january 1 2005 the cumulative amount of earnings for which we have not provided a us income tax accrual was approximately 5750 million the maximum dividend that may qualify for special treatment under the ajca is the lower of approximately 5500 million and the amount of our foreign earnings and profits at the time the dividend is made to one of our us companies 

  we received an rar from the irs in which the irs proposes to assess an aggregate tax deficiency for the tax years 1997 through 1999 of approximately 1430 million plus interest which interest will accrue until the matter is resolved the rar is not a final statutory notice of deficiency and we have filed a protest with the irs to certain of the proposed adjustments we are challenging these proposed adjustments vigorously the irs may also make similar claims for tax returns filed for years subsequent to 1999 while we are protesting certain of the proposed adjustments we cannot predict with certainty the ultimate outcome of the tax examination including the amount payable or timing of such payments which may materially impact our cash flows in the period or periods resolved 

  we expect to incur an additional 40 million to 60 million of future costs in connection with our restructuring activities primarily for facilitiesrelated charges connected with the 2004 restructuring which amounts will be expensed as incurred we expect annualized cost reductions resulting from the 2004 restructuring of approximately 200 million in employee salary and benefits costs related to employee terminations under the restructuring plan 

  during 2005 we plan to continue optimizing our operations in the first quarter of 2005 we announced a plan of restructuring that will reduce our workforce by approximately 200 employees this will result in an estimated restructuring and other expense of approximately 180 million to 200 million in 2005 which will result in cash payments of approximately 150 million to 170 million in 2005 we expect ongoing annual savings of approximately 300 million related to this plan of restructuring 

  in august 2003 we issued 4200 million principal amount of zero coupon zero yield senior convertible notes due 2023 to two initial purchasers in a private offering for resale to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to sec rule 144a we received net proceeds of approximately 4064 million after transaction fees of approximately 136 million that were recorded in other assets and are being amortized to interest expense using the straightline method over five years which is the duration of the first redemption period we issued the notes at par and the notes bear no interest the notes are convertible into our common stock initially at a conversion price of 1565 per share which would result in an aggregate of 268 million shares issued upon conversion subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events we may redeem for cash all or any part of the notes on or after august 15 2008 for 10000 of the principal amount the holders may require us to repurchase for cash all or any portion of their notes on august 15 2008 for 10025 of the principal amount on august 15 2013 for 10000 of the principal amount or on august 15 2018 for 10000 of the principal amount the notes do not contain any restrictive financial covenants 

  concurrently with the issuance of the notes we entered into convertible notes hedge transactions whereby we have options to purchase up to 268 million shares of our common stock at a price of 1565 per share these options expire on august 15 2008 and must be settled in net shares the cost of the convertible notes hedge transactions to us was approximately 1346 million 

  in addition we sold warrants to purchase up to 268 million shares of our common stock at a price of 2308 per share the warrants expire on various dates from february 2008 through may 2008 and must be settled in net shares we received approximately 564 million in cash proceeds for the sales of these warrants 

54   in 2005 we expect to pay between 3150 million to 3350 million in cash payments to stockholders and acquisition costs to acquire verisity ltd as more fully described in note 20 to our consolidated financial statements 

  a summary of our contractual obligations as of january 1 2005 follows 

   the primary components of other longterm obligations of 2335 million related to indemnity holdbacks from acquisitions contingent purchase price payments relating to acquisitions and deferred tax liabilities 

  in connection with our acquisitions completed prior to january 1 2005 we may be obligated to pay up to an aggregate of 470 million in cash during the next 12 months and an additional 360 million in cash during the three years following the next 12 months if certain performance goals related to one or more of the following are achieved in full revenue bookings product proliferation product development and employee retention 

  we expect that current cash and shortterm investment balances and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital and other capital requirements for at least the next 12 months 

new accounting standards 

  in december 2004 the fasb issued sfas no 123r “sharebased payment an amendment of fasb statements nos 123 and 95” which requires the measurement of all employee sharebased payments to employees including grants of employee stock options using a fairvaluebased method and the recording of such expense in our consolidated statements of operations the accounting provisions of sfas no 123r are effective for reporting periods beginning after june 15 2005 we are required to adopt sfas no 123r in our third quarter of fiscal 2005 see “stockbased incentive compensation” of note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for the pro forma net income loss and net income loss per share amounts for 2004 2003 and 2002 as if we had used a fairvaluebased method similar to the methods required under sfas no 123r to measure compensation expense for employee stock incentive awards although we have not yet determined whether the adoption of sfas no 123r will result in future amounts that are similar to the current pro forma disclosures under sfas no 123 we are evaluating the requirements under sfas no 123r and expect the adoption to decrease our net income during 2005 by approximately 250 million to 400 million this estimated range was calculated using the blackscholes optionpricing model based on currently available option information our actual sfas 123r compensation expense for fiscal 2005 could differ from this range due to a difference in expense resulting from utilizing a lattice valuation model instead of the blackscholes model and equity grants at different levels than expected 

  in december 2004 the fasb issued fasb staff position no fas 1091 “application of fasb statement no 109 “accounting for income taxes” to the tax deduction on qualified production activities provided by the american jobs creation act of 2004” the ajca provides for a special 9 tax deduction on qualified production activities fas 1091 clarifies that this tax deduction should be accounted for as a special tax deduction and not as a tax rate reduction in accordance with sfas no 109 “accounting for income 

55 taxes” the adoption of fas 1091 did have a material impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  in december 2004 the fasb issued fasb staff position no fas 1092 “accounting and disclosure guidance for the foreign earnings repatriation provision within the american jobs creation act of 2004” the ajca was enacted on october 22 2004 and created a temporary incentive for us corporations to repatriate accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries by providing an 85 dividends received deduction for certain qualifying dividends the deduction is subject to a number of limitations we may elect to apply this provision to qualifying earnings repatriations during fiscal 2005 fas 1092 provides guidance under sfas no 109 with respect to recording the potential impact of repatriation provisions of the ajca on an enterprise’s income tax expense and deferred tax liability fas 1092 states that an enterprise is allowed additional time beyond the financial reporting period of enactment to evaluate the effect of the ajca on its plan for reinvestment or repatriation of foreign earnings for purposes of applying sfas no 109 we are currently evaluating the merits of repatriating funds under the ajca and expect to complete our evaluation of the effects of the repatriation provision by october 1 2005 the range of possible amounts that we are considering for repatriation under this provision is between zero and 5500 million we have historically considered undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries to be indefinitely reinvested and accordingly we have not provided for income taxes on these undistributed earnings if we decide to repatriate foreign earnings in a future period we will be required to recognize income tax expense related to the federal state local and foreign income taxes that we would incur on the repatriated earnings when the decision is made we are currently unable to reasonably estimate the possible range of income tax effects of such repatriation 

  in march 2004 the fasb issued eitf no 031 “the meaning of otherthantemporary impairment and its application to certain investments” which provided new guidance for assessing impairment losses on investments additionally eitf no 031 includes new disclosure requirements for investments that are deemed to be temporarily impaired in september 2004 the fasb delayed the accounting provisions of eitf no 031 however the disclosure requirements remain effective for annual periods ending after june 15 2004 we have adopted the disclosure requirements and will evaluate the measurement requirements of eitf no 031 once final guidance is issued

 item 9a controls and procedures tableend evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

  we carried out an evaluation required by rule 13a15 of the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended or the exchange act under the supervision and with the participation of our management including the chief executive officer or ceo and the chief financial officer or cfo of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rules 13a15e and 15d15e under the exchange act as of january 1 2005 

  the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures included a review of our processes and implementation and the effect on the information generated for use in this annual report on form 10k in the course of this evaluation we sought to identify any significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in our disclosure controls and procedures to determine whether we had identified any acts of fraud involving personnel who have a significant role in our disclosure controls and procedures and to confirm that any necessary corrective action including process improvements was taken this type of evaluation is done every fiscal quarter so that our conclusions concerning the effectiveness of these controls can be reported in our periodic reports filed with the sec the overall goals of these evaluation activities are to monitor our disclosure controls and procedures and to make modifications as necessary we intend to maintain these disclosure controls and procedures modifying them as circumstances warrant 

  based on their evaluation as of january 1 2005 our ceo and cfo have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were sufficiently effective to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by us in our reports filed or submitted under the exchange act i is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the sec’s rules and forms and ii is accumulated and communicated to our management including the ceo and cfo as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure 

57 changes in internal control over financial reporting 

  there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended january 1 2005 that materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting 

inherent limitations on effectiveness of controls 

  our management including our ceo and cfo does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all error and all fraud a control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within cadence have been detected

through technical support and software updates the services segment provides cadence customers with educational services focused on training customers for the efficient and effective use of cadence technologies methodologies services to assist customers to optimize the use of cadence technologies within their design processes and design services focused on the development of complex ic and other electronic designs for cadence customers who select cadence as their design provider factors driving the electronic design automation industry   during the last decade the worldwide communications business productivity and consumer electronics markets drove development in the electronics industry everdecreasing silicon manufacturing process geometries coupled with the move to 300mm wafer production drive ic cost decreases volume increases and greater complexity for providers of electronics devices at the same time the development of more comprehensive ics complicates effective integration of components into complete electronic systems these market and technology forces pose major challenges for the global electronics design community and consequently create significant opportunities and challenges for eda tool and services providers 3   from a design perspective many of today’s complex ics are systemonachip referred to as soc devices these soc devices as described in more detail below contain one or more processors memory and applicationspecific logic soc design requires implementing an entire electronics subsystem on a single ic smaller feature sizes make it more attractive to put additional circuitry on a single segment of silicon or die the ics fabricated on these dies include one or more processors microprocessors and digital signal processors a highperformance bus for onchip data communication numerous memory devices and peripherals custom digital logic custom analog logic and millions of lines of software code such devices offer benefits in terms of price performance power and size however they are extremely difficult to design designing these soc devices requires the convergence of what have previously been distinct domains for embedded software digital logic analog circuitry and printed circuit board or pcb design this convergence is changing the way designs for these devices are created   the increasing complexity of electronic devices poses major challenges for design teams in the migration to nanometer or one billionth of a meter design and soc design for reference the diameter of the period at the end of this sentence is approximately 400000 nanometers nanometer design refers to the design of ics that will have feature sizes smaller than 180 nanometers ic feature sizes for wires transistors and contacts decrease with each advance in the semiconductor manufacturing process each successive move to a smaller feature size eg decreasing from 180 nanometers to 130 nanometers and smaller requires introducing new capabilities throughout the entire design and manufacturing flow to account for new physical effects for example at 130 nanometers signal integrity issues such as signal interference between wires or crosstalk power distribution management or ir voltage drop and electrical noise on the ic have become critical   these trends pose significant new challenges for electronics design teams specifically nanometer design requires designers to take into account many physical effects they previously ignored soc design requires new approaches to managing complexity and its related risks the electronics industry addresses these challenges in a number of ways including the use of new eda tools the upgrade of design methodologies and offering the advantages of integrated fronttoback design solutions cadence electronic design automation tools   cadence offers one of the most comprehensive sets of eda tools in the industry cadence tools improve designer productivity and design quality throughout the electronic design process functional verification platform   based on a singlekernel or common architecture the cadence incisive tm verification platform supports a unified methodology from design of the total system to designin of particular ics to specific systems for all design domains compared to traditional registertransfer level or rtl simulation approaches incisive provides up to 100 times faster fullchip verification throughout the entire design cycle and reduces total verification time by up to 50 digital ic design platform   the cadence encounter platform leverages a unified architecture for full rtltogdsii digital implementation of nanometerscale designs it is based on a single user interface and unified inmemory data model and was specifically designed to focus on ensuring that interconnect is analyzed and optimized throughout the design process it is comprised of the following core technologies first encounter® ultra a silicon virtual prototyping system that serves as a universal cockpit for the platform nanoroute tm ultra which uses graphbased routing technologies to efficiently support variablespacing variablewidth routes for nanometer process technologies and the celtic tm crosstalk analyzer which is used by leading silicon foundries for precision signal integrity signoff   unlike traditional “frontend backend” systems the encounter platform does not require translations between common tasks such as placement clocktree synthesis routing and timingcrosstalk analysis the soc encounter tm configuration supports hierarchical designs with fullchip rtltogdsii support for designs containing more than 25 million gates a gate is an electronic switch that allows or prevents the flow of 4 current in a circuit nano encounter tm supports fullchip gatestogdsii implementation for nonhierarchical chips and blocks of up to 10 million gates 

custom design tools   cadence offers a broad range of analog and mixedsignal design tools the cadence analog design environment is a fronttoback analog design automation solution for a range of design styles including fullcustom analog digital mixedsignal and radio frequency or rf ic design within that environment designers can use the cadence spectre® circuit simulator rf designers can use the cadence spectre rf simulator on desktop workstations to perform fullchip transistorlevel circuit simulation of rf designs with more than 5000 devices in late 2002 cadence acquired certain assets of antrim design systems inc bringing new tools to the standard custom ic flow that allow better management of design and simulation data automation of timeconsuming tasks and improved handling of engineering changes in later stages in early 2003 cadence acquired celestry design technologies inc whose technology verifies designs against silicon measurements   the cadence virtuoso® suite of custom ic layout tools provides a comprehensive set of layout capabilities including layout editing placement routing and physical verification for analog custom digital mixed signal and rf ics virtuoso custom ic layout includes automation techniques that dramatically boost designer productivity compared to manual customlayout techniques these techniques include correctbyconstruction connectivitydriven capabilities virtuoso custom ic layout is integrated with the cadence assura physical verification toolset which offers automated interactive physical and batch ic layout verification extraction and layout enhancements for manufacturing the assura tool utilizes hierarchical processing techniques to significantly reduce verification cycle times and provide effective debugging capabilities   for years analog mixedsignal design teams have been seeking to move to a “topdown” approach cadence ams designer enables them to do so it is a mixedsignal environment and analog mixedsignal simulator the latter of which is based on the cadence ncsim and spectre simulators design for manufacturing   the physical design of ics requires detailed analysis and optimization to ensure the design can be manufactured cadence’s fire  ice products take the designer’s representation of the ic and extract the physical properties of the design to enable further analysis the signalstorm® and voltagestorm® products address nanometer design challenges associated with onchip distribution of power timing and crosstalk effects cadence’s assura products perform design rule checking to ensure the proposed design meets the requirements of the foundry’s manufacturing process rules cadence’s software and services are designed to provide comprehensive highspeed verification that an ic will perform as designed taking into account the complex effects of nanometer semiconductor physics printed circuit board and ic packaging design tools   cadence produces integrated pcb and ic packaging design flows targeted at solving the design complexities that today’s nanometerscale devices are creating at the package and board level pcb design products address both the highspeed highend of the market and the mainstream segment with scalable versions of allegro® pcb layout specctra® autorouter specctraquest tm design and analysis environment concept® hdl schematic capture

circuits or asics and application specific standard parts and on analog and mixed signal ics the market for these services is primarily the semiconductor and systems companies developing products for the communications computing and consumer market segments cadence design foundry offers engineering capabilities to assist customers from product concept through volume manufacturing   the cadence design foundry also makes its intellectual property or design ip portfolio available to customers these reusable design technologies enable customers to reduce the design complexity and time to market for the development of complex socs this ip portfolio includes technology in four critical design domains  6   design ip may be licensed to customers as a component of an engineering service engagement or sold on an “as is” basis customers generally pay a license fee for access to the design ip and a per unit royalty fee to use it in volume production   through the design foundry’s collaboration with customers in the design of today’s most advanced ics cadence is able to bridge what is often referred to as the “design gap” the design gap refers to the inability of ic design techniques to keep pace with semiconductor process technology advances by designing firstoftheirkind ics cadence design foundry gains direct and early visibility to industry design issues that may not be addressed adequately by today’s design automation solutions this enables cadence to accelerate the development of new software technology to meet the market’s current and future design requirements

relationships 

competition   cadence currently competes primarily with two large companies mentor graphics corporation and synopsys inc in 2002 two large eda companies synopsys inc and avant corporation merged and the combined company offers a broader product range cadence also competes with numerous smaller eda companies with manufacturers of electronic devices that have developed or have the capability to develop their own eda products and with numerous electronics design and consulting companies manufacturers of electronic devices may be reluctant to purchase services from independent vendors such as cadence because they wish to promote their own internal design departments proprietary technology   cadence’s success depends in part upon its proprietary technology cadence generally relies on patents copyrights trademarks trade secret laws licenses and restrictive agreements to establish and protect its proprietary rights in technology and products many cadence products include software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties cadence may have to seek new or renew existing licenses for such software and other intellectual property in the future the cadence design foundry licenses certain software and other intellectual property of third parties including that of competitors manufacturing and distribution   cadence software production operations consist of configuring the proper version of a product outsourcing the recording of the product on cdrom and producing customerunique access keys allowing customers to use licensed products software and documentation are generally made available to customers electronically by secured electronic delivery user manuals and other documentation are generally available on cdrom but are occasionally supplied in hard copy format   cadence performs final assembly and test of its hardware verification acceleration and emulation products in san jose california subcontractors manufacture all major subassemblies including all individual printed circuit boards and custom ics and supply them to cadence for qualification and testing prior to their incorporation into the assembled product backlog   cadence’s backlog on december 28 2002 was approximately 14 billion backlog consists of    cadence has not historically experienced significant cancellation of its contracts with customers customers often reschedule the required completion dates of services contracts which has the effect of deferring revenue recognition under those contracts beyond the original expected completion date 8 employees   as of march 1 2003 cadence employed approximately 5175 individuals with approximately 2455 in sales services marketing support and manufacturing activities 1970 in product development and 750 in management administration and finance none of cadence’s employees is represented by a labor union and cadence has experienced no work stoppages cadence believes that its employee relations are good factors that may affect future results   the following risk factors and other information included in this annual report on form 10k should be carefully considered additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to cadence or that cadence currently deems insignificant also may impair cadence’s business operations if any of the following risks actually occurs cadence’s business operating results and financial condition could be materially harmed cadence is subject to the cyclical nature of the integrated circuit and electronics systems industries and the current downturn or any future downturns may reduce cadence’s revenue 

  purchases of cadence’s products and services are highly dependent upon the commencement of new design projects by ic manufacturers and electronics systems companies the ic industry is highly cyclical and is characterized by constant and rapid technological change rapid product obsolescence and price erosion evolving standards short product life cycles and wide fluctuations in product supply and demand the ic and electronics systems industries have experienced significant downturns often connected with or in anticipation of maturing product cycles of both these companies’ and their customers’ products and a decline in general economic conditions these downturns have been characterized by diminished product demand production overcapacity high inventory levels and accelerated erosion of average selling prices during these downturns the number of new design projects may decrease ic manufacturers and electronics systems companies experienced a downturn in demand and production in 2001 and in 2002 which has continued in 2003 cadence expects revenue to continue to be adversely affected by the general downturn in the economy and in particular the electronics industry the current downturn and any future downturns may reduce cadence’s software and maintenance revenue and further reduce its services and hardware revenue and harm its results of operations fluctuations in operating results for any fiscal period could hurt cadence’s business and the market price of its stock 

  cadence has experienced and may continue to experience varied quarterly operating results various factors affect cadence’s quarterly operating results and some of them are not within cadence’s control cadence’s quarterly operating results are affected by the timing of significant orders for its software products because a significant number of contracts for software products are in excess of 50 million the failure to close a contract for one or more orders for cadence’s software products could seriously harm its quarterly operating results   cadence’s operating results are also affected by the mix of license types executed in any given period cadence has three basic licensing models term subscription and perpetual product revenue associated with term and perpetual licenses is generally recognized at the beginning of the license period while product revenue associated with subscription licenses is recognized ratably over the term of the license revenue may also be deferred under term and perpetual licenses until payments become due and payable from customers with nonlinear payment terms or as cash is collected from customers with lower credit ratings   in 2002 cadence experienced increasing customer preference for its subscription licenses which give customers limited access to new technology revenue recognized on a ratable basis is expected to continue to increase as a percentage of overall revenue to the extent customers continue to prefer subscription licenses in the future or continue to request more flexible payment terms both of which cause revenue to be recognized ratably over time 9   cadence plans operating expense levels primarily based on forecasted revenue levels these expenses and the impact of longterm commitments are relatively fixed in the short term a shortfall in revenue could lead to operating results being below expectations as cadence may not be able to quickly reduce these fixed expenses in response to shortterm business changes   stockholders should not view cadence’s historical results of operations as reliable indicators of its future performance if revenue or operating results fall short of the levels expected by public market analysts and investors the trading price of cadence common stock could decline dramatically the lengthy sales cycle of cadence’s products and services makes the timing of its revenue difficult to predict and may cause its operating results to fluctuate unexpectedly 

  cadence has a lengthy sales cycle that generally extends at least three to six months the length of the sales cycle may cause cadence’s revenue and operating results to vary unexpectedly from quarter to quarter the complexity and expense associated with cadence’s business generally requires a lengthy customer education evaluation and approval process consequently cadence may incur substantial expenses and devote significant management effort and expense to develop potential relationships that do not result in agreements or revenue and may prevent cadence from pursuing other opportunities   in addition sales of cadence products and services may be delayed if customers delay approval or commencement of projects because of    lengthy sales cycles for acceleration and emulation hardware products subject cadence to a number of significant risks over which cadence has limited control including insufficient excess or obsolete inventory variations in inventory valuation and fluctuations in quarterly operating results   also because of the timing of large orders and its customers’ buying patterns cadence may not learn of bookings shortfalls revenue shortfalls earnings shortfalls or other failures to meet market expectations until late in a fiscal quarter which could cause even more immediate and serious harm to the trading price of cadence common stock cadence’s failure to respond quickly to technological developments could make its products uncompetitive and obsolete 

  the industries in which cadence competes experience rapid technology developments changes in industry standards changes in customer requirements and frequent new product introductions and improvements currently the industries cadence serves are experiencing several revolutionary trends  10   if cadence is unable to respond quickly and successfully to these developments and the evolution of these changes cadence may lose its competitive position and its products or technologies may become uncompetitive or obsolete to compete successfully cadence must develop or acquire new products and improve its existing products and processes on a schedule that keeps pace with technological developments in its industries cadence must also be able to support a range of changing computer software hardware platforms and customer preferences cadence cannot guarantee that it will be successful in this respect cadence has historically suffered losses in its electronics design services business   the market for electronics design services is sensitive to customer budgetary constraints and engineering capacity cadence’s design services business has historically suffered losses if cadence’s design services business fails to increase its revenue to offset its expenses the design services business will continue to experience losses cadence’s failure to succeed in the design services business may harm cadence’s business operating results and financial condition the profitability of cadence’s services business depends on factors that are difficult to control   to be successful in its services business cadence must overcome several factors that are difficult to control including the following  cadence’s inability to compete in its industries could seriously harm its business   the eda market and the commercial electronics design and methodology services industries are highly competitive if cadence were unable to compete successfully in these industries it could seriously harm cadence’s business operating results and financial condition to compete in these industries cadence must identify and develop or acquire innovative and cost competitive eda products and market them in a timely manner it must also gain industry acceptance for its design and methodology services and offer better strategic concepts technical solutions prices and response time or a combination of these factors than those of other design companies and the internal design departments of electronics manufacturers cadence cannot assure you that it will be able to compete successfully in these industries factors that could affect cadence’s ability to succeed include  11    cadence currently competes primarily with two large companies mentor graphics corporation and synopsys inc in 2002 two large eda companies synopsys inc and avant corporation merged and the combined company offers a broader product range cadence also competes with numerous smaller eda companies with manufacturers of electronic devices that have developed or have the capability to develop their own eda products and with numerous electronics design and consulting companies manufacturers of electronic devices may be reluctant to purchase services from independent vendors such as cadence because they wish to promote their own internal design departments cadence’s failure to obtain software or other intellectual property licenses or adequately protect its proprietary rights could seriously harm its business 

  cadence’s success depends in part upon its proprietary technology cadence generally relies on patents copyrights trademarks trade secret laws licenses and restrictive agreements to establish and protect its proprietary rights in technology and products despite precautions cadence may take to protect its intellectual property cadence cannot assure you that third parties will not try to challenge invalidate or circumvent these safeguards cadence also cannot assure you that the rights granted under its patents or attendant to its other intellectual property will provide it with any competitive advantages or that patents will be issued on any of its pending applications or that future patents will be sufficiently broad to protect cadence’s technology furthermore the laws of foreign countries may not protect cadence’s proprietary rights in those countries to the same extent as us law protects these rights in the united states many cadence products include software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties cadence may have to seek new or renew existing licenses for such software and other intellectual property in the future the cadence design foundry licenses certain software and other intellectual property of third parties including that of competitors cadence’s failure to obtain for its use software or other intellectual property licenses or other intellectual property rights on favorable terms or the need to engage in litigation over these licenses or rights could seriously harm cadence’s business operating results and financial condition   cadence cannot assure you that its reliance on licenses from restrictive agreements with third parties or that patent copyright trademark and trade secret protections will be enough to be successful and profitable in the industries in which cadence competes intellectual property infringement by or against cadence could seriously harm its business   there are numerous patents in the eda industry and new patents are being issued at a rapid rate it is not always practicable to determine in advance whether a product or any of its components infringes the patent rights of others as a result from time to time cadence may be forced to respond to or prosecute intellectual property infringement claims to protect its rights or defend a customer’s rights these claims regardless of merit could consume valuable management time result in costly litigation or cause product shipment delays all of which could seriously harm cadence’s business operating results and financial condition in settling these claims cadence may be required to enter into royalty or licensing agreements with the third parties claiming infringement these royalty or licensing agreements if available may not have terms favorable to cadence being forced to enter into a license agreement with unfavorable terms could seriously harm cadence’s business operating results and financial condition any potential intellectual property litigation could force cadence to do one or more of the following    if cadence were forced to take any of these actions cadence’s business and results of operations may suffer 12 cadence obtains key components for its hardware products from a limited number of suppliers   cadence depends on several suppliers for certain key components and board assemblies used in its hardwarebased verification products cadence’s inability to develop alternative sources or to obtain sufficient quantities of these components or board assemblies could result in delays or reductions in product shipments in particular cadence currently relies on international business machines corporation or ibm to manufacture hardware components for cadence’s palladium tm products if there were such a reduction or interruption cadence’s results of operations would be seriously harmed even if cadence could eventually obtain these components from alternative sources a significant delay in cadence’s ability to deliver products would result cadence has acquired and expects to acquire other companies and businesses and may not realize the expected benefits of these acquisitions 

  cadence has acquired and expects to acquire other companies and businesses in the future while cadence expects to analyze carefully all potential transactions before committing to them cadence cannot assure you that any transaction that is completed will result in longterm benefits to cadence or its stockholders or that cadence’s management will be able to manage the acquired businesses effectively in addition growth through acquisition involves a number of risks if any of the following events occurs after cadence acquires another business it could seriously harm cadence’s business operating results and financial condition  cadence’s international operations may seriously harm its financial condition because of several weak foreign economies and the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations   cadence has significant operations outside the united states cadence’s revenue from international operations as a percentage of total revenue was approximately 45 in 2002 and 2001 cadence expects that revenue from its international operations will continue to account for a significant portion of its total revenue cadence also transacts business in various foreign currencies recent economic and political uncertainty and the volatility of foreign currencies in certain regions most notably the japanese yen and the euro have had and may continue to have a seriously harmful effect on cadence’s revenue and operating results   fluctuations in the rate of exchange between the us dollar and the currencies of other countries in which cadence conducts business could seriously harm its business operating results and financial condition for example if there is an increase in the rate at which a foreign currency exchanges into us dollars it will take more of the foreign currency to equal a specified amount of us dollars than before the rate increase if cadence prices its products and services in the foreign currency it will receive less in us dollars than it did before the rate increase went into effect if cadence prices its products and services in us dollars an increase in the exchange rate will result in an increase in the price for cadence’s products and services compared to those products of its competitors that are priced in local currency this could result in cadence’s prices being uncompetitive in markets where business is transacted in the local currency 13   exposure to foreign currency transaction risk can arise when transactions are conducted in a currency different from the functional currency of a cadence subsidiary a subsidiary’s functional currency is the currency in which it primarily conducts its operations including product pricing expenses and borrowings although cadence attempts to reduce the impact of foreign currency fluctuations significant exchange rate movements may hurt cadence’s results of operations as expressed in us dollars   foreign currency exchange risk occurs for some of cadence’s foreign operations whose functional currency is the local currency the primary effect of foreign currency translation on cadence’s results of operations is a reduction in revenue from a strengthening us dollar offset by a smaller reduction in expenses exchange rate gains and losses on the translation into us dollars of amounts denominated in foreign currencies are included as a separate component of stockholders’ equity   cadence’s international operations may also be subject to other risks including  

 

   cadence’s future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where cadence is taxed at lower statutory rates by changes in the valuation of cadence’s deferred tax assets and liabilities or by changes in tax laws or interpretations of such tax laws 

 

   cadence must comply with us department of commerce regulations in shipping its software products and other technologies outside the united states although cadence has not had any significant difficulty complying with these regulations so far any significant future difficulty in complying could harm cadence’s business operating results and financial condition 

 

   competition for highly skilled employees is often intense cadence’s business depends on the efforts and abilities of its senior management its research and development staff and a number of other key management sales support technical and services employees the high cost of training new employees not fully utilizing these employees or losing trained employees to competing employers could reduce cadence’s gross margins and harm its business and operating results competition for these employees may be intense particularly in geographic areas recognized as high technology centers such as the silicon valley area where cadence’s principal offices are located and the other locations where it maintains facilities to attract and retain individuals with the requisite expertise cadence may be required to grant large numbers of stock options or other stockbased incentive awards which may be dilutive to existing stockholders cadence may also be required to pay significant base salaries and cash bonuses which could harm its operating results   in addition new regulations proposed by the new york stock exchange requiring shareholder approval for all stock option plans and prohibiting new york stock exchange member organizations from giving a 14 proxy to vote on equity compensation plans unless the beneficial owner of the shares has given voting instructions could make it more difficult for cadence to grant options to employees in the future to the extent that new regulations make it more difficult or expensive to grant options to employees cadence may incur increased cash compensation costs or find it difficult to attract retain and motivate employees which could materially and adversely affect its business 

if cadence becomes subject to unfair hiring claims cadence could be prevented from hiring needed employees incur liability for damages and incur substantial costs in defending itself

   cadence’s critical accounting policies are as follows  

 

   cadence derives revenue from three sources    as described below significant management judgments and estimates are made and used to determine the revenue recognized in any accounting period   cadence applies the provisions of statement of position 972 “software revenue recognition” as amended by statement of position 989 “modification of sop 972 software revenue recognition with respect to certain transactions” to all product revenue transactions where the software is not incidental cadence also applies the provisions of sfas no 13 “accounting for leases” to all hardware lease transactions   cadence recognizes product revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists the product has been delivered the fee is fixed or determinable collection of the resulting receivable is probable and vendorspecific objective evidence of fair value or vsoe exists to allocate the total fee among all delivered and undelivered elements in the arrangement if vsoe does not exist for all elements to support the allocation of the total fee among all delivered and undelivered elements of the arrangement revenue is deferred until such evidence does exist for the undelivered elements or until all elements are delivered whichever is earlier if vsoe of all undelivered elements exists but vsoe does not exist for one or more delivered elements revenue is recognized using the residual method under the residual method the vsoe of the undelivered elements is deferred and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee is recognized as revenue   cadence’s vsoe for certain product elements of an arrangement is based upon the pricing for comparable transactions when the element is sold separately cadence’s vsoe for maintenance is based upon 24 the customer’s annual renewal rates vsoe for services is based on the price charged when the services are sold separately the timing of revenue recognition for both delivered and undelivered elements is in accordance with the relevant provisions of sop 972 

  cadence sells software using three license types these license types are    for subscription and term licenses and hardware leases cadence uses the license agreement and a signed contract as evidence of an arrangement for perpetual licenses hardware sales maintenance renewals and small fixedprice service projects such as training classes and small standard methodology service engagements of approximately 10000 or less cadence uses a purchase order as evidence of an arrangement for all other service engagements cadence uses a signed professional services agreement and a statement of work to evidence an arrangement sales through its japanese distributor are evidenced by a master agreement governing the relationship together with binding purchase orders from the distributor on a transactionbytransaction basis   software is delivered to customers electronically or on a cdrom with respect to hardware delivery of an entire system is deemed to occur upon installation   cadence assesses whether a fee is fixed or determinable primarily based on the payment terms associated with the transaction cadence uses installment contracts for subscription and term licenses and has established a history of collecting under the original contract without providing concessions on payments products or services the time periods of installment contracts are equal to or less than the time period of the licenses and payments are generally collected quarterly if different conditions were to prevail and cadence no longer had a history of collecting under the original contract without providing concessions on term licenses revenue from term licenses would be recognized as payments under the installment contract become due and payable this change could have a material impact on cadence’s results of operations   cadence assesses collectibility based on a number of factors including the customer’s past payment history and its current creditworthiness if collection of a fee is not probable cadence defers the revenue and recognizes it at the time collection becomes reasonably assured which is generally upon receipt of cash payment   provided all the related conditions discussed above are met cadence recognizes revenue for each software license type as follows    maintenance revenue consists of fees for providing technical support and software updates on a whenandif available basis cadence recognizes all maintenance revenue ratably over the maintenance period under each software license agreement for term and perpetual licenses customers renew maintenance agreements annually for subscription licenses a portion of the revenue is allocated to maintenance revenue   services revenue consists primarily of revenue received for performing methodology and design services revenue from service contracts is recognized on either a time and materials basis as work is performed or using the percentageofcompletion method cadence estimates the percentageofcompletion on contracts with fixed or nottoexceed fees on a monthly basis utilizing hours incurred to date as a percentage of total 25 estimated hours to complete the project cadence has a history of accurately estimating project status and the hours necessary to complete projects if different conditions were to prevail such that accurate estimates could not be made then the use of the completed contract method would be required and all revenue and costs would be deferred until the project was completed this change could have a material impact on cadence’s results of operations for small fixedprice projects such as training classes and small standard methodology service engagements of approximately 10000 or less revenue is recognized when the work is completed 

  in september 2002 cadence acquired ibm’s tda business concurrent with the acquisition cadence licensed software to ibm and entered into an agreement to provide services   for concurrent transactions cadence considers sfas no 141 “business combinations” and eitf issue no 983 “determining whether a nonmonetary transaction involves receipt of productive assets or of a business” to determine whether the acquisition of the tda business qualified for accounting as a purchase business combination in addition cadence considered apb opinion no 29 “accounting for nonmonetary transactions” and eitf issue no 0102 “interpretation of apb opinion no 29” to determine whether the concurrent transactions were appropriately recorded at their respective fair values monetary transactions and nonmonetary transactions that represent the culmination of an earnings process are recorded at the fair values of the products delivered or products or services received whichever is more readily determinable if the fair values are reasonably determinable in concluding that the fair values were reasonably determinable cadence considered its recent history of cash sales for similar products or services in similar sized transactions with similar terms approximately 3 of revenue recognized in 2002 resulted from this concurrent transaction estimating valuation allowances and accrued liabilities   the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ from those estimates   management specifically analyzes accounts receivable and also analyzes historical bad debts customer concentrations customer creditworthiness current economic trends and changes in customer payment terms changes in customer demand and sales returns when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns in any accounting period material differences may result in the amount and timing of revenue andor expenses for any period if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates   cadence has restructured business units in the past and has established reserves at the low end of the range of estimable cost against outstanding commitments for leased properties that it has vacated these reserves are based upon management’s estimate of the landlord’s willingness to negotiate a termination fee the time required to sublet the properties and the amount of sublease income that cadence estimates will be generated between the date the property was vacated and expiration of the lease for each of the vacated properties these estimates are reviewed and revised quarterly and may result in a substantial change to restructuring expense should different conditions prevail than were anticipated in original management estimates see note 2 of notes to consolidated financial statements for the expected impact of new accounting standards on future restructuring charges accounting for income taxes   in preparing its consolidated financial statements cadence is required to estimate its income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates this process involves estimating actual current tax liability together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items such as deferred revenue for tax and accounting purposes these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which are included within the consolidated balance sheets cadence then assesses the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent it believes that recovery is not likely 26 cadence must establish a valuation allowance to the extent cadence establishes a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets or increases this allowance in a period cadence may need to include an expense within the tax provision in its consolidated income statements 

  significant management judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets the valuation allowance is based on estimates of taxable income for each jurisdiction in which cadence operates and the period over which deferred tax assets will be recoverable in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or cadence adjusts these estimates in future periods cadence may need to establish an additional valuation allowance which could materially affect its financial position and results of operations valuation of longlived intangible assets and goodwill   cadence reviews at least annually goodwill resulting from purchase business combinations for impairment in accordance with sfas no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” cadence reviews longlived assets including certain identifiable intangibles for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that cadence will not be able to recover the asset’s carrying amount in accordance with sfas no 144 “accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets”   for longlived assets to be held and used including acquired intangibles cadence initiates its review whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a longlived asset may not be recoverable recoverability of an asset is measured by comparison of its carrying amount to the expected future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of that asset excluding future interest costs that would be recognized as an expense when incurred any impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair market value significant management judgment is required in the forecasting of future operating results and proceeds from disposition which are used in the preparation of projected cash flows and should different conditions prevail or judgments be made material impairment charges could be necessary results of operations revenue  sources of revenue as a percent of total revenue    product revenue decreased 186 million in 2002 compared to 2001 primarily due to a shift in the mix of software license types executed in each period in 2002 cadence experienced increasing customer preference for its subscription licenses which give customers limited access to new technology product revenue associated with subscription licenses is recognized ratably over the term of the license which has the effect of deferring the timing of revenue recognition to future periods revenue may also be deferred under term and perpetual licenses until payments become due and payable from customers with nonlinear payment terms or 27 as cash is collected from customers with lower credit ratings product revenue from cadence’s software licenses recognized on a ratable basis comprised 45 32 and 19 of software revenue for the years ended 2002 2001 and 2000 respectively 

  revenue recognized on a ratable basis is expected to continue to increase as a percentage of overall revenue to the extent customers continue to prefer subscription licenses in the future or continue to request more flexible payment terms both of which cause revenue to be recognized ratably over time   product revenue increased 2031 million in 2001 compared to 2000 primarily due to an overall increase in volume of license renewals with major customers and to a lesser extent an increase in sales of cadence’s software products to new customers the increase in sales volume was primarily due to an increase in sales volume of cadence’s ic implementation products which include synthesis place and route physical design and physical verification products the increases were partially offset by a decrease in cadence verification acceleration or cva product sales   services revenue decreased 1135 million in 2002 compared to 2001 primarily due to a reduction in customer spending for external services as a result of the economic downturn experienced in the electronics industry which cadence serves services revenue declined primarily due to fewer new engagements and fewer services hours billed on existing engagements reduced customer spending can be expected to affect services revenue in the future to the extent the economy in general and the electronics industry in particular continue to experience slow economic growth   services revenue decreased 726 million in 2001 compared to 2000 primarily due to a reduction in customer spending for external services as a result of the economic downturn experienced in the industries cadence serves particularly telecommunication tality’s revenue declined 499 million in 2001 compared to 2000 primarily due to fewer new engagements and fewer services hours billed on existing engagements methodology services revenue declined 222 million in 2001 compared to 2000 primarily due to a general weakness in customer demand for shortterm consulting services   maintenance revenue decreased 52 million in 2002 compared to 2001 primarily due to fewer renewals of maintenance contracts maintenance revenue increased 204 million in 2001 compared to 2000 primarily due to the growth of cadence’s installed customer base and the renewal of maintenance and support contracts   additional financial information about segments can be found in note 19 of notes to consolidated financial statements revenue by geography  revenue by geography as a percent of total revenue    international revenue decreased 671 million in 2002 compared to 2001 due to decreases in services revenue worldwide and decreases in product revenue in europe slightly offset by an increase in product revenue in japan revenue in japan accounted for 33 of total international revenue in 2002 compared to 28 in 2001 the slight increase in product revenue in japan was due to the timing of license renewals for existing 28 customers and was partially offset by a decrease in services revenue cadence does not expect significant revenue growth in japan in the foreseeable future due to continuing stagnant economic conditions in japan 

  international revenue increased 862 million in 2001 compared to 2000 primarily due to increases in product revenue worldwide partially offset by a decrease in services revenue worldwide revenue in japan accounted for 28 of total international revenue in 2001 compared to 35 in 2000 revenue in japan decreased as a result of lower services revenue   differences in the rate of revenue growth over the periods presented and as compared geographically are primarily due to fluctuations in product sales volume and the timing of significant customer contracts   foreign currency exchange rates negatively affected revenue by 84 million in 2002 primarily due to the weakening of the japanese yen in relation to the us dollar foreign currency exchange rates negatively affected revenue by 199 million in 2001 primarily due to the weakening of the japanese yen foreign currency exchange rates negatively affected revenue by 38 million in 2000 primarily due to the weakening of the british pound and german mark in relation to the us dollar partially offset by the strengthening of the japanese yen in relation to the us dollar additional information about revenue and other financial information by geography can be found in note 19 of notes to consolidated financial statements cost of revenue  cost of revenue as a percent of related revenue    cost of product revenue includes costs of employee salary and benefits documentation and royalties manufacturing costs associated with cva products also include materials labor and overhead   a summary of cost of product is as follows    cost of product revenue decreased 251 million in 2002 compared to 2001 primarily due to a decrease in sales of cva products and lower amounts of inventory writeoffs in 2002 compared to 2001 cost of product revenue increased 83 million in 2001 compared to 2000 the increase was primarily due to increases in inventory writeoffs partially offset by decreases in manufacturing expenses associated with the decrease in sales of cva products   in the year ended december 28 2002 cadence recorded a 93 million writeoff for excess inventory in cost of product revenue for excess inventory from decreased sales forecasts in the year ended december 29 29 2001 cadence recorded an 189 million writeoff for excess inventory in cost of product revenue of the 189 million 152 million of the writeoff was related to excess inventory from decreased sales forecasts and 37 million related to two product lines that were discontinued as part of cadence’s restructuring the excess inventory charges of 93 million in 2002 and 152 million in 2001 were due to significant decreases in forecasted revenue for emulation products and were calculated in accordance with cadence’s policy which is based on inventory in excess of 12month demand inventory purchases and commitments are based on future sales forecasts cadence typically buys and builds inventory levels for certain key components to mitigate component supply constraints based on cadence’s current 12month demand forecast cadence does not anticipate that the excess inventory will be used at a later date cadence has determined that inventory levels at december 28 2002 were within forecasted usage for the succeeding 12month period 

  product gross margin increased slightly in 2002 when compared to 2001 primarily due to lower inventory writeoffs in 2002 product gross margin increased in 2001 compared to 2000 primarily due to an increase in volume of license renewals with major customers   cost of services revenue primarily includes employee salary and benefits costs to maintain the infrastructure necessary to manage a services organization and provisions for contract losses if any cost of services revenue decreased 787 million in 2002 compared to 2001 primarily due to decreases in employee salary and benefit costs resulting from cadence’s reduction of services professionals in connection with its restructuring actions initiated in 2001 cost of services revenue decreased 242 million in 2001 compared to 2000 primarily due to decreases in employee salary and benefit costs resulting from cadence’s reduction of services professionals in connection with its restructuring initiated in 2001   services gross margin decreased in 2002 compared to 2001 primarily due to the downturn in the industries cadence serves particularly telecommunications resulting in revenue declining faster than costs services gross margin decreased in 2001 compared to 2000 also primarily due to revenue declining faster than costs services gross margin has been and may continue to be reduced by cadence’s inability to fully utilize its services resources   cost of maintenance revenue includes the cost of customer services such as hotline and onsite support production employees and documentation of maintenance updates cost of maintenance revenue decreased 11 million in 2002 compared to 2001 primarily due to a decrease in employee salary and benefit costs resulting from a decrease in employee headcount cost of maintenance revenue increased 20 million in 2001 compared to 2000 primarily due to an increase in employee salary and benefit costs resulting from an increase in employee headcount 

 

  

 

  30 marketing and sales   marketing and sales expenses increased 60 million in 2002 compared to 2001 primarily due to an increase in employee salary and benefit costs resulting from an increase in employee headcount primarily from acquisitions partially offset by a decrease in marketing program expenses marketing and sales expenses increased 35 million in 2001 compared to 2000 primarily due to an increase in employee salary and benefit costs resulting from an increase in employee headcount partially offset by a decrease in commissions expense cadence expects marketing and sales expenses to decrease in 2003 as a result of a decrease in employee headcount research and development   the increase in research and development expense of 291 million for 2002 compared to 2001 was primarily due to an increase in employee salary and benefit costs resulting from an increase in employee headcount primarily from acquisitions the increase in research and development expense of 334 million for 2001 compared to 2000 was primarily due to an increase in employee salary and benefit costs resulting from an increase in employee headcount cadence expects research and development expenses to increase in 2003 compared to 2002 general and administrative   general and administrative expense decreased 36 million in 2002 compared to 2001 primarily due to a decrease in bad debt expense particularly related to the design services business and a decrease in employee salary and benefit costs resulting from a decrease in employee headcount the decrease was partially offset by 111 million of litigation expense general and administrative expense increased 181 million in 2001 compared to 2000 primarily due to an increase of employee salary and benefit costs resulting from an increase in employee headcount increases in bad debt expense related to tality and increased use of outside consulting services   foreign currency exchange rates negatively affected operating expenses by 12 million in 2002 compared to 2001 primarily due to the strengthening of the euro and british pound in relation to the us dollar foreign currency exchange rates positively affected operating expenses by 93 million in 2001 compared to 2000 primarily due to the weakening of the japanese yen and british pound in relation to the us dollar amortization of acquired intangibles  amortization of acquired intangibles as a percent of total revenue    amortization of acquired intangibles decreased 106 million in 2002 compared to 2001 primarily due to the effects of implementing sfas no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” which requires that goodwill no longer be amortized this reduction was partially offset by amortization of intangibles acquired from spc and simplex amortization of acquired intangibles increased 118 million in 2001 compared to 2000 primarily due to the 2001 acquisition of cadmos partially offset by a reduction attributable to the writeoff of diablo research company llc or diablo goodwill in the second quarter of 2001 see note 6 of notes to consolidated financial statements 31 amortization of deferred stock compensation  amortization of deferred stock compensation as a percent of total revenue    cadence recorded deferred stock compensation resulting from stock options granted in 2001 and 2000 which were subsequently retired to purchase tality stock and sales of tality restricted stock deferred stock compensation from tality option grants and restricted stock sales represents the difference between the exercise price of stock option grants to tality employees and directors and the price paid for restricted stock by certain cadence executives and employees and the deemed fair market value of tality’s common stock at the time of those grants and sales   in addition cadence recorded deferred stock compensation resulting from cadence’s acquisition of cadmos simplex spc and plato design systems incorporated deferred stock compensation resulting from these acquisitions represents the difference between the exercise price of unvested stock option grants to employees of the acquired companies and the fair market value of cadence’s common stock at the time of such acquisitions   deferred compensation expense of 97 million related to the spc acquisition was recorded in 2002 because a portion of the additional shares issued upon attaining performance goals required continued employment with cadence of certain spc employees the acquisition agreement provides for the issuance of additional shares of cadence’s common stock as certain performance goals are achieved in fiscal 2003   amortization of deferred stock compensation increased 196 million in 2002 compared to 2001 primarily due to the deferred stock compensation related to the plato simplex and spc acquisitions amortization of deferred stock compensation increased 65 million in 2001 compared to 2000 primarily due to the absence of similar costs in the first six months of 2000   for the years ended december 28 2002 and december 29 2001 cadence recorded on its balance sheet a total of 377 million and 404 million of deferred stock compensation respectively of the 377 million 195 million is related to spc’s achievement of certain predetermined goals 99 million is related to the acquisition of plato and 83 million is related to the acquisition of simplex of the 404 million 274 million is related to the acquisition of spc 100 million is related to the acquisition of cadmos and 30 million is related to tality stock option grants cadence is amortizing deferred stock compensation to expense using the straightline method over the period that the stock options and restricted stock vest for the year ended december 28 2002 and december 29 2001 cadence reversed deferred stock compensation of 109 million and 278 million respectively related to the cancellation of unvested options avant restitution and settlement   on november 13 2002 cadence announced the settlement of civil litigation filed against avant seeking damages related to theft of cadence intellectual property including software code as well as other trade secrets the settlement with avant its parent corporation synopsys inc and several individuals included an agreement to dismiss all pending claims and counterclaims in the litigation and required the payment to cadence of 2650 million which was received in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2002 this amount net of related costs is recorded in avant restitution and settlement in cadence’s consolidated income statement   on july 25 2001 avant was ordered to pay cadence 1954 million in criminal restitution after avant entered a plea of no contest and was found guilty by the superior court of the state of california of conspiracy to take and use cadence’s trade secrets this conspiracy included the theft by avant and certain individuals 32 of cadence intellectual property including software code as well as other trade secrets as of december 29 2001 approximately 1960 million consisting of all of the restitution award plus interest was received this amount net of related costs is recorded in avant restitution and settlement in cadence’s consolidated income statement 

restructuring and other charges   in 2001 cadence announced a plan of restructuring activities throughout the company targeted at eliminating redundancies and consolidating facilities and resources the restructuring activities were initiated primarily due to the severe economic downturn in the electronics industry the restructuring was primarily aimed at reducing excess personnel and capacity costs within cadence’s design foundry business formerly tality and certain other businessinfrastructure groups   a summary of restructuring charges and asset impairment is as follows    for the year ended december 29 2001 cadence recorded 616 million of restructuring and other charges cadence’s restructuring costs and other charges consisted of 216 million for workforce reduction 219 million to downsize and close excess facilities and 181 million of assetrelated charges related to certain longlived assets that were abandoned management estimates that the restructuring will result in annualized cost reductions of approximately 704 million in employee salary and benefit costs related to the 2001 workforce reduction   for the year ended december 28 2002 cadence recorded 1343 million of restructuring and other charges cadence’s restructuring costs and other charges consisted of 522 million for workforce reduction 469 million in changes in estimates for previously recorded accruals and to downsize and close excess facilities and 352 million of assetrelated charges related to certain longlived assets that were abandoned management estimates that cadence will realize annualized cost reductions of approximately 159 million in salary and benefit costs related to the 2002 workforce reduction and 16 million in facility costs related to facilities downsized or closed since the commencement of the restructuring activity in 2001 which amounts could vary based on changes in estimates   the 2001 restructuring activities resulted in a reduction of 705 employees which were predominately tality employees while employee reductions were across all business functions operating units and geographic regions cadence’s wireless communicationsrelated areas within tality were affected more than other areas in addition the number of temporary and contract workers employed by cadence were reduced severance costs resulting from the restructuring included severance benefits notice pay and outplacement services as the result of the separation of tality from cadence approximately 53 million of the restructuring charges was paid to certain tality employees who were participants in cadence’s employee stock purchase plan prior to tality’s separation from cadence in october 2000 all terminations and termination benefits were communicated to the affected employees prior to december 29 2001 all severance benefits were paid out before the end of the first quarter of 2002   the 2002 restructuring activities will result in the termination of employment of approximately 1370 employees while such terminations of employment are across various business functions operating units and geographic regions the communicationsrelated areas within the design services business are the most affected costs resulting from the restructuring included severance benefits notice pay and outplacement services all terminations and termination benefits were communicated to the affected employees prior to december 28 2002 all severance benefits are expected to be paid by december 27 2003 33   for the year ended december 29 2001 facilities consolidation charges of 219 million were incurred in connection with the downsizing and closing of 16 sites as of december 29 2001 six sites had been vacated and eight sites had been downsized   for the year ended december 28 2002 facilities consolidation charges of 469 million were incurred in connection with the further downsizing of four previously downsized sites the downsizing and closing of 16 additional sites and changes in lease loss estimates for three sites of the 469 million 173 million related to changes in lease loss estimates the low end of the lease loss range related to all worldwide restructuring activities initiated in 2001 is 256 million which will be adjusted in the future upon triggering events such as changes in estimates of time to sublease and actual sublease rates cadence has estimated that the high end of the lease loss could be as much as 550 million if facilities operating lease rental rates continue to decrease in applicable markets or if it takes longer than expected to find a suitable tenant to sublease the facilities since june 2001 33 sites have been selected for downsizing or closure as of december 28 2002 16 sites had been vacated nine sites had been downsized and actions related to the eight remaining sites are scheduled to occur by the end of 2003   closure and downsizing costs included payments required under lease contracts less any applicable estimated sublease income after the properties were abandoned lease buyout costs restoration costs associated with certain lease arrangements and costs to maintain facilities during the period after abandonment to determine the lease loss which is the loss after cadence’s cost recovery efforts from subleasing a building certain assumptions were made related to the 1 time period over which the relevant building would remain vacant 2 sublease terms and 3 sublease rates including common area charges the lease loss is an estimate and represents the low end of the range   for the year ended december 29 2001 cadence incurred assetrelated and other restructuring charges of 181 million consisting primarily of 144 million of leasehold improvements for facilities and other fixed assets that were either abandoned or for which the resulting estimated future reduced cash flows were insufficient to cover the associated expenses cadence also recorded 22 million of assetrelated charges for abandoned software   for the year ended december 28 2002 assetrelated and other restructuring charges of 352 million were incurred in connection with leasehold improvements for facilities other fixed assets and software license agreements that were abandoned and contract termination costs writeoff of acquired inprocess technology   upon consummation of the acquisition of ibm’s tda business in september 2002 cadence immediately charged to expense 66 million representing acquired inprocess technology that had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use the purchase price allocated to acquired inprocess technology was determined by identifying research projects in areas for which technological feasibility has not been established the value was determined by estimating costs to develop the acquired inprocess technology into commercially viable products estimating the resulting net cash flows from such projects and discounting the net cash flows back to their present value the discount rate included a factor that reflects the uncertainty surrounding successful development of the acquired inprocess technology the inprocess technology is expected to be commercially viable in september 2003 as of december 28 2002 expenditures to complete the inprocess technology totaled 25 million and expenditures to complete the remaining inprocess technology are expected to total approximately 88 million these estimates are subject to change given the uncertainties of the development process and no assurance can be given that deviations from these estimates will not occur additionally these projects will require additional research and development after they have reached a state of technological and commercial feasibility   at the time of its acquisition by cadence the ibm tda business’ inprocess research and development projects were related to the development of testbench tools the nature of the efforts to complete these projects related in varying degrees to the completion of all planning designing prototyping verification and testing activities necessary to establish that the proposed technologies meet their design specifications including functional technical and economic performance requirements 34   the net cash flows resulting from the projects underway in the ibm tda business used to value the purchased research and development were based on management’s estimates of revenue cost of revenue research and development costs selling general and administrative costs and income taxes from such projects the revenue projections were based on the potential market size that the projects address cadence’s ability to gain market acceptance in these segments and the life cycle of this inprocess technology   estimated total revenue from the acquired inprocess technology is expected to peak primarily in 2006 and decline rapidly thereafter as other new products are expected to enter the market in addition a portion of the anticipated revenue had been attributed to enhancements of the base technology under development and has been excluded from net cash flow calculations existing technology was valued at 122 million the net cash flows generated from the acquired inprocess technology were expected to reflect earnings before interest taxes and depreciation of approximately 65 of the revenue generated from inprocess technology however there can be no assurance that these estimates will prove accurate or that cadence will realize the anticipated benefit of the acquisition   the rate used to discount the net cash flows from purchased inprocess technology was approximately 24 the discount rate is sometimes higher than cadence’s weighted average cost of capital or wacc due to the inherent uncertainties in the estimates including the uncertainty surrounding the successful development of the acquired inprocess technology the useful life of such technology the profitability levels of such technology if any and the uncertainty of technological advances all of which were unknown at that time   upon consummation of the simplex acquisition in june 2002 cadence immediately charged to expense 274 million

cadence’s wacc calculation produces the average required rate of return of an investment in an operating enterprise based on the required rates of return from investments in various areas of the enterprise the rate used to discount the net cash flows from purchased inprocess technology was 36 the discount rate is sometimes higher than cadence’s wacc due to the inherent uncertainties in the estimates including the uncertainty surrounding the successful development of the acquired inprocess technology the useful life of such technology the profitability levels of such technology if any and the uncertainty of technological advances all of which were unknown at that time   during 2001 cadence acquired substantially all of the assets of two companies for an initial aggregate price of 105 million of which 44 million was cash and 61 million was shares of cadence common stock plus future contingent payments the acquisitions were accounted for as purchases upon consummation of the acquisitions cadence charged to expense immediately after the respective acquisition an aggregate of 10 million representing acquired inprocess technology that had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use 36   upon consummation of the cadmos acquisition cadence immediately charged to expense 121 million representing acquired inprocess technology that had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use the amount of purchase price allocated to acquired inprocess technology was determined in part by a third party appraiser

inprocess technology however there can be no assurance that these assumptions will prove accurate or that cadence will realize the anticipated benefit of the acquisition   the discount of the net cash flows to their present value was based on cadence’s wacc the rate used to discount the net cash flows from purchased inprocess technology was 28 the discount rate is sometimes higher than cadence’s wacc due to the inherent uncertainties in the estimates including the uncertainty surrounding the successful development of the acquired inprocess technology the useful life of such technology the profitability levels of such technology if any and the uncertainty of technological advances all of which were unknown at that time impairment of goodwill   prior to the adoption of sfas no 142 discussed in note 2 of notes to consolidated financial statements cadence evaluated goodwill for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicated that the carrying amount of goodwill may not be recoverable cadence recorded a charge of 258 million in 2001 related to the impairment of goodwill and acquired intangibles associated with the acquisition of diablo this impairment was due to the decline in business conditions generally and the wireless communications industry in particular key factors in determining this impairment were significant downsizing or reassignment of personnel directly related to these assets and abandonment of most of diablo’s line of business the impairment was calculated as the difference between the carrying value of the intangible assets associated with diablo’s acquisition and the fair value of those assets 37 other income loss net   other income loss net for 2002 2001 and 2000 are as follows    total other income loss net decreased 183 million in 2002 when compared to 2001 primarily due to 100 million of investment writedowns from two venture capital funds telos venture partners lp and telos venture partners ii lp collectively referred to as telos in which cadence holds a limited partnership interest included in other expense net and 94 million of investment writedowns in cadence’s longterm investments included in other expense net total other income loss net decreased 27 million in 2001 when compared to 2000 primarily due to a decrease in foreign exchange gains partially offset by an increase in interest income provision for income taxes   the provision for income taxes and the effective tax rates for 2002 2001 and 2000 are as follows    as of december 28 2002 cadence had total net deferred tax assets of approximately 1053 million realization of the deferred tax assets will depend on generating sufficient taxable income prior to the expiration of certain net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards although realization is not assured management believes that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets will be realized the amount of the net deferred tax assets however could be reduced or increased in the near term if actual facts including the estimate of future taxable income differ from those estimated   the 2002 effective tax rate includes avant civil settlement proceeds of 2650 million the writeoff of acquired inprocess technology of approximately 340 million and stock compensation of approximately 444 million the 2002 effective tax rate excluding the avant civil settlement proceeds the writeoff of acquired inprocess technology and stock compensation was 260 the 2001 effective tax rate includes avant criminal restitution proceeds of approximately 1960 million the writeoff of acquired inprocess technology of approximately 217 million and stock compensation amortization of approximately 179 million the 2001 effective tax rate excluding the avant criminal restitution proceeds the writeoff of acquired inprocess technology and stock compensation was 265 disclosures about market risk interest rate risk   cadence’s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to its shortterm investment portfolio while cadence is exposed to interest rate fluctuations in many of the world’s leading industrialized countries cadence’s interest income and expense is most sensitive to fluctuations in the general level of us interest rates in this regard changes in us interest rates affect the interest earned on cadence’s 38 cash and cash equivalents shortterm and longterm investments and interest paid on its longterm debt obligations as well as costs associated with foreign currency hedges 

  cadence invests in high quality credit issuers and by policy limits the amount of its credit exposure to any one issuer as part of its policy cadence’s first priority is to reduce the risk of principal loss consequently cadence seeks to preserve its invested funds by limiting default risk market risk and reinvestment risk cadence mitigates default risk by investing in only high quality credit securities that it believes to be low risk and by positioning its portfolio to respond appropriately to a significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor the shortterm interestbearing portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity   on september 27 2002 cadence entered into two syndicated senior unsecured credit facilities or the 2002 facilities that allow cadence to borrow up to 3750 million one of the 2002 facilities is a 1875 million threeyear revolving credit facility or the threeyear facility which terminates on september 27 2005 the other 2002 facility consists of a 1875 million 364day revolving credit facility convertible into a term loan or the 364day facility the 364day facility will terminate on september 26 2003 provided that at the request of cadence and with the consent of members of the bank group that wish to do so the date of termination may be extended for one additional 364day period with respect to the portion of the amounts outstanding under the 364day credit agreement that a consenting bank holds upon the scheduled andor extended termination amounts outstanding under the 364day facility may be converted to a oneyear term loan   for both of the 2002 facilities cadence has the option to pay interest based on libor plus a spread of between 125 and 150 based on a pricing grid tied to a financial covenant or the higher of the federal funds rate plus 050 or the prime rate in addition commitment fees are payable on the unused portion of the threeyear facility at rates between 025 and 0335 based on a pricing grid tied to a financial covenant and on the unused portion of the 364day facility at a fixed rate of 0225 a utilization fee of 025 is payable on amounts borrowed under the 2002 facilities whenever combined borrowings under the 2002 facilities exceed 1238 million cadence may not borrow under the 364day facility at any time that any portion of the threeyear facility remains unused   the 2002 facilities contain certain financial and other covenants which must be maintained the financial covenants specify that cadence must maintain a minimum earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization or ebitda of not less than 2000 million additionally cadence must maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio the ratio of ebitda to the sum of i interest expense plus ii 20 of funded debt plus iii taxes paid in cash plus iv capital lease payments of not less than 15 to 10 other covenants require cadence to maintain a minimum onetoone ratio of current assets to current liabilities and a maximum twotoone funded debt to ebitda ratio and to directly own not less than 51 of its consolidated total assets from time to time cadence borrows amounts under the 2002 facilities at december 28 2002 cadence was in compliance with the covenants in the 2002 facilities and had outstanding borrowings of 520 million under the threeyear facility   the 2002 facilities replaced two previously existing credit facilities which terminated on september 27 2002 in connection with the termination of the previously existing credit facilities cadence paid in full all interest principal fees and other amounts owing thereunder 39   the table below presents the carrying value and related weighted average interest rates for cadence’s interest bearing instruments all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase are considered to be cash equivalents investments with original maturities between three and 12 months are considered to be shortterm investments investments with original maturities greater than 12 months are considered longterm investments the carrying value approximated fair value at december 28 2002  foreign currency risk   cadence’s operations include transactions in foreign currencies and as such cadence benefits from a weaker dollar and is adversely affected by a stronger dollar relative to major currencies worldwide the primary effect of foreign currency transactions on cadence’s results of operations from a weakening us dollar is an increase in revenue offset by a smaller increase in expenses conversely the primary effect of foreign currency transactions on cadence’s results of operations from a strengthening us dollar is a reduction in revenue offset by a smaller reduction in expenses   cadence enters into foreign currency forward exchange contracts with financial institutions to protect against currency exchange risks associated with existing assets and liabilities a foreign currency forward exchange contract acts as a hedge by increasing in value when underlying asset exposures decrease in value or underlying liability exposures increase in value conversely a foreign currency forward exchange contract decreases in value when underlying asset exposures increase in value or underlying liability exposures decrease in value forward contracts are not accounted for as hedges and therefore the unrealized gains and losses are recognized in other income loss net in advance of the actual foreign currency cash flows with the fair value of these forward contracts being recorded as accrued liabilities   cadence does not use forward contracts for trading purposes cadence’s ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to currency fluctuations will depend on the currency exchange rates in effect as the forward contracts mature   the table below provides information as of december 28 2002 about cadence’s forward foreign currency contracts the information is provided in us dollar equivalent amounts the table presents the notional 40 amounts at contract exchange rates and the weighted average contractual foreign currency exchange rates these forward contracts mature prior to march 14 2003 

   while cadence actively manages its foreign currency risks on an ongoing basis there can be no assurance that cadence’s foreign currency hedging activities will substantially offset the impact of fluctuations in currency exchange rates on its results of operations cash flows and financial position on a net basis foreign currency fluctuations did not materially impact cadence’s results of operations and financial position during the year ended december 28 2002 the realized gain loss on the forward contracts as they matured was not material to the consolidated operations of cadence equity price risk   cadence repurchases shares of its common stock under its stock repurchase program repurchased shares may be used for general corporate purposes including the share issuance requirements of cadence’s employee stock option and purchase plans and acquisitions cadence may purchase stock in the open market for cash or may purchase call options or sell put warrants to mitigate equity price risk associated with its stock repurchase program the put warrants if exercised and settled by physical delivery of shares would entitle the holder to sell shares of cadence common stock to cadence at a specified price similarly the call options entitle cadence to buy shares of cadence common stock at a specified price cadence has the option to elect “net share settlement” rather than physical settlement of put warrants that are exercised that is cadence has the right to settle the exercised put warrants with shares of cadence common stock valued at the difference between the exercise price and the fair value of the stock at the date of exercise these transactions may result in sales of a large number of shares and consequent decline in the market price of cadence common stock cadence’s stock repurchase program includes the following characteristics  41    as of december 28 2002 there were no put warrants or call options outstanding liquidity and capital resources   at december 28 2002 cadence’s principal sources of liquidity consisted of 3956 million of cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments compared to 2748 million at december 29 2001 and two syndicated senior unsecured credit facilities totaling 3750 million as of december 28 2002 cadence had a total of 520 million outstanding under these credit facilities   cash provided by operating activities decreased 606 million to 3502 million at december 28 2002 when compared to the year ended december 29 2001 primarily due to lower net income of 693 million a decrease in the proceeds from the sale of receivables of 538 million an increase in receivables of 663 million partially offset by an increase in noncash restructuring and other charges of 69 million and a decrease in installment contract receivables of 379 million   cadence has entered into agreements whereby it may transfer qualifying accounts receivable to certain financing institutions on a nonrecourse basis these transfers are recorded as sales and accounted for in accordance with sfas no 140 “accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities” during the fiscal years ended december 28 2002 and december 29 2001 cadence transferred accounts receivable totaling 1820 million and 2358 million respectively which approximated fair value to financing institutions on a nonrecourse basis for the years ended december 29 2001 and december 30 2000 cadence has restated its statements of cash flows to include proceeds from the sale of receivables as a component of cash flows from operating activities rather than as a component of cash flows from financing activities which is consistent with the guidance of sfas no 95 “statement of cash flows”   at december 28 2002 cadence had net working capital of 2468 million as compared with 1625 million at december 29 2001 the working capital increase was driven primarily by increases in cash and cash equivalents of 1650 million increases in net receivables of 556 million partially offset by decreases in shortterm investments of 442 million decreases in prepaid expenses and other of 441 million and increases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of 384 million   in addition to its shortterm investments cadence’s primary investing activities in 2002 consisted of business combinations purchases of property plant and equipment and venture capital partnership investments which combined represented 1780 million and 1696 million of cash used for investing activities for the years ended december 28 2002 and december 29 2001 respectively   cadence provides for us income taxes on the earnings of its foreign subsidiaries unless they are considered permanently invested outside of the united states at december 28 2002 the cumulative amount of earnings upon which us income taxes have not been provided are approximately 550 million at december 28 2002 the unrecognized deferred tax liability for these earnings was approximately 114 million   cadence has previously sold put warrants and purchased call options through private placements see note 11 of notes to consolidated financial statements at december 28 2002 there were no put warrants or call options outstanding   cadence also purchased 1818 million of its stock with cash and reissued 772 million of stock through its employee option and stock purchase programs during the year ended december 28 2002   as part of its overall investment strategy cadence is a limited partner in telos as of december 28 2002 cadence has committed 773 million to telos and is contractually committed to contribute up to an 42 additional 537 million cadence’s investments in telos are recorded in other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 

  as compared to the prior year other longterm liabilities increased 796 million to 2144 million for the year ended december 28 2002 the increase was primarily attributable to an increase in income taxes payable and longterm lease obligations of the restructuring activities the primary components of other longterm liabilities are income taxes payable of 1455 million deferred compensation of 349 million and lease obligations related to restructuring activities of 336 million   on september 27 2002 cadence entered into two syndicated senior unsecured credit facilities or the 2002 facilities that allow cadence to borrow up to 3750 million one of the 2002 facilities is a 1875 million threeyear revolving credit facility or the threeyear facility which terminates on september 27 2005 the other 2002 facility consists of a 1875 million 364day revolving credit facility convertible into a term loan or the 364day facility the 364day facility will terminate on september 26 2003 provided that at the request of cadence and with the consent of members of the bank group that wish to do so the date of termination may be extended for one additional 364day period with respect to the portion of the amounts outstanding under the 364day credit agreement that a consenting bank holds upon the scheduled andor extended termination amounts outstanding under the 364day facility may be converted to a oneyear term loan   for both of the 2002 facilities cadence has the option to pay interest based on libor plus a spread of between 125 and 150 based on a pricing grid tied to a financial covenant or the higher of the federal funds rate plus 050 or the prime rate in addition commitment fees are payable on the unused portion of the threeyear facility at rates between 025 and 0335 based on a pricing grid tied to a financial covenant and on the unused portion of the 364day facility at a fixed rate of 0225 a utilization fee of 025 is payable on amounts borrowed under the 2002 facilities whenever combined borrowings under the 2002 facilities exceed 1238 million cadence may not borrow under the 364day facility at any time that any portion of the threeyear facility remains unused   the 2002 facilities contain certain financial and other covenants which must be maintained the financial covenants specify that cadence must maintain a minimum earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization or ebitda of not less than 2000 million additionally cadence must maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio the ratio of ebitda to the sum of i interest expense plus ii 20 of

at december 28 2002 cadence was in compliance with the covenants in the 2002 facilities and had outstanding borrowings of 520 million under the threeyear facility   the 2002 facilities replaced two previously existing credit facilities which terminated on september 27 2002 in connection with the termination of the previously existing credit facilities cadence paid in full all interest principal fees and other amounts owing thereunder   management estimates that the restructuring actions for 2002 will result in annualized cost reductions of approximately 159 million in salary and benefits all severance benefits are expected to be paid by december 27 2003 cadence expects to pay approximately 15 million in rental and operating expenses in 2003 related to facilities downsized or closed since the commencement of the restructuring activity in 2001 43   a summary of contractual obligations follows    cadence anticipates that current cash and shortterm investment balances and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet its working capital and other capital requirements for at least the next 12 months new accounting standards   in january 2003 the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 46 or fin 46 “consolidation of variable interest entities — an interpretation of arb no 51” fin 46 requires companies to include in their consolidated financial statements the assets liabilities and results of activities of variable interest entities if the company holds a majority of the variable interests the consolidation requirements of fin 46 are effective for variable interest entities created after january 31 2003 or for entities in which an interest is acquired after january 31 2003 the consolidation requirements of fin 46 are effective june 15 2003 for all variable interest entities acquired before february 1 2003 fin 46 also requires companies that expect to consolidate a variable interest entity they acquired before february 1 2003 to disclose the entity’s nature size activities and the company’s maximum exposure to loss in financial statements issued after january 31 2003 cadence has determined fin 46 will not have a material effect on its consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows   in december 2002 the fasb issued sfas no 148 “accounting for stockbased compensation — transition and disclosure” sfas no 148 amends sfas no 123 “accounting for stockbased compensation” to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stockbased employee compensation in addition sfas no 148 amends the disclosure requirements of sfas no 123 to require disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stockbased employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results the annual and interim disclosure provisions are effective for financial reports containing financial statements for annual and interim periods ending after december 15 2002 cadence has adopted the disclosure provisions for these annual financial statements and will adopt the interim disclosure provisions for its interim financial statements beginning with the period ending march 28 2003 cadence has determined that the adoption of sfas no 148 will not have a material impact on its consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows   in november 2002 the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 45 or fin 45 “guarantor’s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others” fin 45 requires that upon issuance of a guarantee a guarantor must recognize a liability for the fair value of an obligation assumed under a guarantee fin 45 also requires additional disclosures by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about the obligations associated with guarantees issued the recognition provisions of fin 45 are effective for any guarantees issued or modified after december 31 2002 the disclosure requirements are effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods ending after december 15 2002 see note 9 of notes to consolidated financial statements for disclosures required by fin 45 the adoption of fin 45 did not have a material effect on cadence’s consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows   in july 2002 the fasb issued sfas no 146 “accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities” sfas no 146 eliminates eitf issue no 943 “liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructur 44 ing” under sfas no 146 liabilities for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity are recognized when the liabilities are incurred as opposed to being recognized at the date of entity’s commitment to an exit plan under eitf no 943 furthermore sfas no 146 establishes that fair value is the objective for initial measurement of the liabilities sfas no 146 will be effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december 31 2002 cadence has determined sfas no 146 will not have a material effect on its consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows however sfas no 146 will impact the timing of accruals for future restructurings

item 14 controls and procedures   within 90 days prior to the filing date of this annual report on form 10k cadence carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of the company’s management including its chief executive officer ceo and the chief financial officer cfo of the effectiveness of the design and operation of cadence’s “disclosure controls and procedures” and “internal controls” as specified in item 307 of regulation sk   disclosure controls and procedures are designed with the objective of ensuring that i information required to be disclosed in cadence’s reports filed under the securities exchange act of 1934 is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the securities and exchange commission’s rules and forms and ii information is accumulated and communicated to management including the ceo and cfo as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure internal controls are procedures designed with the objective of providing reasonable assurance that the company’s a transactions are properly authorized b assets are safeguarded against unauthorized or improper use and c transactions are properly recorded and reported all to permit the preparation of the company’s financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles   the evaluation of cadence’s disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls included a review of their objectives and processes implementation by the company and effect on the information generated for use in this annual report on form 10k in the course of this evaluation cadence sought to identify any significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in cadence’s controls whether the company had identified any acts of fraud involving personnel who have a significant role in the company’s internal controls and to confirm that any necessary corrective action including process improvements were being undertaken this type of evaluation will be done on a quarterly basis so that the conclusions concerning the effectiveness of these controls can be reported in the company’s quarterly reports on form 10q and annual report on form 10k the company’s internal controls are also evaluated on an ongoing basis by cadence’s internal auditors and by other personnel in cadence’s finance organization the overall goals of these evaluation activities are to monitor the company’s disclosure and internal controls and to make modifications as 46 necessary the company intends to maintain these controls as processes that may be appropriately modified as circumstances warrant 

  based on the evaluation described above and subject to the discussion below the chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that cadence’s controls and procedures are effective in timely alerting them to material information relating to the company including its consolidated subsidiaries required to be included in this annual report on form 10k there have been no significant changes in the company’s internal controls or in other factors that could significantly affect those controls since the date of their last evaluation however a control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met management necessarily applied its judgment in assessing the benefits of controls relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within the company have been detected the design of any system of controls is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions regardless of how remote because of the inherent limitations in a costeffective control system misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected 47

  soc design refers to implementing an entire electronics subsystem on a single integrated circuit smaller feature sizes make it more economical to put additional circuitry on a single die the ics fabricated on these dies include one or more processors microprocessors and digital signal processors a highperformance bus numerous memory devices and peripherals custom digital logic custom analog logic and millions of lines of software code such devices offer benefits in terms of price performance power and size however they are extremely difficult to design   these trends pose significant new challenges for electronics design teams specifically deep submicron design requires designers to take into account many physical effects they previously ignored soc design requires new approaches to managing complexity and its related risks the electronics industry addresses these challenges in a number of ways including the use of new eda tools the upgrade of design methodologies and offering integrated fronttoback design solutions cadence electronic design automation tools   cadence offers the most comprehensive set of eda tools in its industry cadence tools improve designer productivity and design quality throughout the electronic design process systemlevel design tools   cadence systemlevel design tools help design teams optimize their designs and provide a smooth path to detailed hardware design the cadence virtual component codesign or vcc solution lets designers capture and verify system behavior independent of hardware and software implementation designers can then map the behavior to a variety of architectural implementations and analyze the results of each using this rapid exploration tool teams can optimize their overall systemlevel design including critical hardwaresoftware partitioning vcc is also an ideal environment for platformbased design for those portions of the behavior that are algorithmic in nature the cadence signal processing worksystem solution provides a specialized environment for capturing and analyzing floatingpoint and fixedpoint algorithms it also serves as a systemlevel testbench environment especially for communications and multimedia applications functional and systemlevel verification tools   design teams need a range of simulation and hardwarebased acceleration tools to verify the functionality of their designs cadence offers a comprehensive set of simulators and emulators for behavioral registertransferlevel and gatelevel functional verification cadence’s digital simulators include the ncverilog® simulator for the verilog® language ncvhdl for the vhdl® language and ncsim which simultaneously supports both languages these simulators provide designers with the simulation performance and capacity they need to verify the functionality of complex designs the cadence verification cockpit provides an environment for creating testbenches analyzing results and debugging designs at a transaction level cadence also provides standardsbased transaction verification models for use in this environment   for design teams that need to accelerate simulations andor verify designs at the systemlevel the cadence

corporation tality filed a registration statement with the securities and exchange commission for tality’s initial public offering or ipo tality’s separation from cadence was substantially completed on october 4 2000 and the electronic design services business operated as a subsidiary of cadence in april 2001 cadence announced the withdrawal of the tality ipo registration statement tality was reorganized during the second third and fourth quarters of 2001 and is currently a whollyowned subsidiary of cadence   tality’s engineering services and intellectual property are used for the design of complex electronic systems and integrated circuits tality focuses its offerings primarily on the communications market targeted segments of this market include wireline and wireless communications infrastructure and consumer communications products the engineering services extend from product concept through manufacturing to help communications companies implement their product plans tality’s business has been adversely affected by the general slowdown in the economy and the electronics industry specifically see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations” verification and asp services   cadence’s quickturn division offers verification and asp services through ttme® timetomarket engineering services and the quickcycles tm programs the ttme

vcad through which 6 engineering teams at one or more cadence locations provide technical support through a virtual private network to customer design groups located at the customers’ design sites 

marketing and sales   cadence generally uses a direct sales force consisting of sales people and applications engineers to license its products and market its consulting and design services to prospective customers applications engineers provide technical presales as well as postsales support for software products the cadence methodology services group provides onsite capabilities to help customers improve productivity with cadence and other eda products due to the complexity of eda products and the electronic design process in general the sales cycle is generally long three to six months or more during the sales cycle the cadence direct sales force generally provides technical presentations product demonstrations and onsite customer evaluations of cadence software cadence also uses traditional marketing approaches to promote its products and services including advertising direct mail telemarketing trade shows public relations and the internet   cadence markets and supports its products and services internationally through its subsidiaries and various distributors cadence markets its emulation hardware and consulting and design services in japan through a whollyowned subsidiary since the reorganization of cadence’s distribution channel in japan in 1997 cadence has licensed its software products through innotech corporation in which cadence is an approximately 15 stockholder as of december 29 2001 research and development   cadence’s investment in research and development was 3275 million in 2001 2924 million in 2000 and 2449 million in 1999 prior to capitalizing software development costs of 302 million 284 million and 257 million respectively see “notes to consolidated financial statements” for a more complete description of cadence’s capitalization of certain software development costs   the primary areas of cadence’s research include soc design the design of silicon devices in the deep submicron range highspeed board design architecturallevel design highperformance logic verification technology and hardware software codesign   cadence’s advanced research and development group cadence laboratories is focused on new technology this group is chartered with identifying and developing prototype technologies in emerging design areas that will offer substantially improved alternatives to current eda solutions competition   in the eda products industry cadence currently competes with three large companies avant corporation mentor graphics corporation and synopsys inc in december 2001 avant and synopsys announced their intention to merge and if this merger is completed the combined company could improve its competitive position with respect to cadence cadence also competes with numerous smaller companies a number of which have become publiclytraded companies or have combined with other eda companies cadence also competes with manufacturers of electronic devices that have developed or have the capability to internally develop their own eda products many manufacturers of electronic devices may be reluctant to purchase services from independent vendors such as cadence because they wish to promote their own internal design departments in the electronics design and methodology services industries cadence competes with numerous electronic design and consulting companies as well as with the internal design capabilities of electronics manufacturers other electronics companies and management consulting firms continue to enter the electronics design and methodology services industries   the eda product market and the commercial electronic design and methodology services industries are highly competitive if cadence were unable to compete successfully in these industries it could seriously harm cadence’s business operating results and financial condition to compete in these industries cadence must identify and develop innovative and costcompetitive eda products and market them in a timely manner it must also gain industry acceptance for its design and methodology services and offer better strategic concepts 7 technical solutions prices and response time or a combination of these benefits than those of other design companies and the internal design departments of electronics manufacturers cadence cannot assure you that it will be able to compete successfully in these industries 

proprietary technology   cadence’s success depends in part upon its proprietary technology cadence generally relies on patents copyrights trademarks trade secret laws licenses and restrictive agreements to establish and protect its proprietary rights in technology and products despite precautions cadence may take to protect its intellectual property cadence cannot assure you that third parties will not try to challenge invalidate or circumvent these safeguards cadence also cannot assure you that the rights granted under its patents will provide it with any competitive advantages patents will be issued on any of its pending applications or future patents will be sufficiently broad to protect cadence’s technology furthermore the laws of foreign countries may not protect cadence’s proprietary rights in those countries to the same extent as us law protects these rights in the united states many cadence products include software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties cadence may have to seek new or renew existing licenses for such software and other intellectual property in the future the cadence design services business also requires it to license the software or other intellectual property of third parties including that of competitors cadence’s failure to obtain for its use software or other intellectual property licenses or other intellectual property rights on favorable terms or the need to engage in litigation over these licenses or rights could seriously harm cadence’s business operating results and financial condition manufacturing and distribution   cadence software production operations consist of configuring the proper version of a product outsourcing the recording of the product on magnetic tape or cdrom and producing customerunique access keys allowing customers to use licensed products software and documentation are generally made available to customers electronically by secured electronic delivery and to selected customers by electronic distribution over the internet user manuals and other documentation are generally available on cdrom but are occasionally supplied in hard copy format   cadence performs final assembly and test of its hardware emulation products in san jose california subcontractors manufacture all major subassemblies including all individual printed circuit boards and custom integrated circuits and supply them to cadence for qualification and testing prior to their incorporation into the assembled product employees   as of march 2 2002 cadence employed approximately 5600 persons with approximately 2975 in sales services marketing support and manufacturing activities 1800 in product development and 825 in management administration and finance none of cadence’s employees is represented by a labor union and cadence has experienced no work stoppages cadence believes that its employee relations are good factors that may affect future results   the following risk factors and other information included in this annual report on form 10k should be carefully considered the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones cadence faces additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to cadence or that cadence currently deems immaterial also may impair cadence’s business operations if any of the following risks actually occurs cadence’s business operating results and financial condition could be materially harmed unless specifically noted references to cadence in the discussion below are references to cadence and its subsidiaries 8 cadence is subject to the cyclical nature of the integrated circuit and electronics systems industries and the current downturn or any future downturns may reduce cadence revenue 

  purchases of cadence’s products and services are highly dependent upon the commencement of new design projects by integrated circuit manufacturers and electronics systems companies the integrated circuit industry is highly cyclical and is characterized by constant and rapid technological change rapid product obsolescence and price erosion evolving standards short product life cycles and wide fluctuations in product supply and demand the integrated circuit and electronics systems industries have experienced significant downturns often connected with or in anticipation of maturing product cycles of both these companies’ and their customers’ products and a decline in general economic conditions these downturns have been characterized by diminished product demand production overcapacity high inventory levels and accelerated erosion of average selling prices during these downturns the number of new design projects may decrease certain integrated circuit manufacturers and electronics systems companies announced a slowdown of demand and production in 2001 which has continued in 2002 services and hardware revenue is expected to continue to be adversely affected by the general slowdown in the economy and in the electronics industry specifically the current slowdown and any future downturns may reduce cadence’s software and maintenance revenue and further reduce its services and hardware revenue and harm its results of operations fluctuations in quarterly results of operations could hurt cadence’s business and the market price of its stock 

  cadence has experienced and may continue to experience varied quarterly operating results various factors affect cadence’s quarterly operating results and some of them are not entirely within cadence’s control including the timing of significant orders and the mix of licenses used to sell products see “management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation — critical accounting policies” cadence’s quarterly operating results are affected by the timing of significant orders for its software products because a significant number of contracts for software products are in excess of 50 million the failure to close a contract for the sale of one or more orders of cadence’s software products could seriously harm its quarterly operating results   cadence’s quarterly operating results are affected by the mix of license types entered into in connection with the sale of software products cadence has three basic licensing models term subscription and perpetual term and perpetual licenses generally recognize the revenue for such licenses at the beginning of the license period while subscription licenses recognize revenue ratably over the term of the license in the fourth quarter of 2001 cadence’s mix of software license types based on total contract value was approximately 50 term licenses 40 subscription licenses and 10 perpetual licenses should different conditions prevail so that the mix of cadence’s license types were to change to a higher proportion of subscription licenses cadence’s software license revenue in that period would decline because a greater portion of revenue would be recognized over time that decline could have a material impact on the results of operations in the quarter of the change in mix   sales of cadence’s hardware products depend in significant part upon the decision of the prospective customer to commence a project for the design and development of complex integrated circuits and systems these projects often require significant commitments of time and capital cadence’s hardware sales may be delayed if customers delay commencement of projects lengthy hardware sales cycles subject cadence to a number of significant risks over which cadence has little or no control including insufficient excess or obsolete inventory variations in inventory valuation and fluctuations in quarterly operating results   in addition cadence bases its expense budgets partially on its expectations of future revenue however it is difficult to predict revenue levels or growth revenue levels that are below cadence’s expectations could seriously hurt cadence’s business operating results and financial condition also because of the timing of large orders and its customers’ buying patterns cadence may not learn of revenue shortfalls earnings shortfalls or other failures to meet market expectations until late in a fiscal quarter which could cause even more immediate and serious harm to the trading price of cadence common stock many of cadence’s services engagements are terminable with little or no advance notice and without penalty since a significant portion of 9 the costs of services is laborrelated cadence may not be able to reduce its costs in a timely manner to respond to an unanticipated revenue loss when one or more projects are terminated 

  cadence believes that quartertoquarter comparisons of its results of operations may not be meaningful therefore stockholders should not view cadence’s historical results of operations as reliable indicators of its future performance if revenue or operating results fall short of the levels expected by public market analysts and investors the trading price of cadence common stock could decline dramatically the lengthy sales cycle of cadence’s products and services makes the timing of its revenue difficult to    cadence has a lengthy sales cycle that generally extends at least three to six months the length of the sales cycle may cause cadence’s revenue and operating results to vary unexpectedly from quarter to quarter the complexity and expense associated with cadence’s business generally requires a lengthy customer education and approval process consequently cadence may incur substantial expenses and devote significant management effort and expense to develop potential relationships that do not result in agreements or revenue and may prevent cadence from pursuing other opportunities   in addition sales of cadence products and services may be delayed if customers delay approval or commencement of projects because of    if customers experience delays in their approval or project commencement activities cadence may not learn of and therefore be able to communicate to the public revenue or earnings shortfalls until late in a fiscal quarter cadence’s failure to respond quickly to technological developments could make its products uncompetitive    the industries in which cadence competes experience rapid technology developments changes in industry standards changes in customer requirements and frequent new product introductions and improvements currently the electronic ic design industry is experiencing several revolutionary trends    if cadence is unable to respond quickly and successfully to these developments and the evolution of these changes cadence may lose its competitive position and its products or technologies may become uncompetitive or obsolete to compete successfully cadence must develop or acquire new products and improve its existing products and processes on a schedule that keeps pace with technological developments in its 10 industries cadence must also be able to support a range of changing computer software hardware platforms and customer preferences there is no guarantee that cadence will be successful in this respect 

cadence has historically suffered losses in its electronics design services business   the market for electronics design services is relatively new rapidly evolving and sensitive to customer budgetary constraints and engineering capacity tality has historically suffered losses and it incurred significant expenses in connection with its separation if tality fails to increase its revenue to offset its expenses tality will continue to experience losses tality’s failure to succeed in the design services business may seriously harm cadence’s business operating results and financial condition the success of cadence’s services businesses depend on factors that are difficult to control   in order to be successful with its services cadence must overcome several factors that are difficult to control including the following  cadence’s inability to compete in its industries could seriously harm its business   the eda market and the commercial electronics design and methodology services industries are highly competitive if cadence were unable to compete successfully in these industries it could seriously harm cadence’s business operating results and financial condition to compete in these industries cadence must identify and develop innovative and cost competitive eda software products and market them in a timely manner it must also gain industry acceptance for its design and methodology services and offer better strategic concepts technical solutions prices and response time or a combination of these factors than those of other design companies and the internal design departments of electronics manufacturers cadence cannot assure you that it will be able to compete successfully in these industries factors that could affect cadence’s ability to succeed include  11   in the eda products industry cadence currently competes with three large companies avant corporation mentor graphics corporation and synopsys inc in december 2001 synopsys and avant announced their intention to merge and if this merger is completed the combined company could improve its competitive position with respect to cadence cadence also competes with numerous smaller companies a number of which have become publiclytraded companies or have combined with other eda companies cadence also competes with manufacturers of electronic devices that have developed or have the capability to develop their own eda products many manufacturers of electronic devices may be reluctant to purchase services from independent vendors such as cadence because they wish to promote their own internal design departments in the electronics design and methodology services industries cadence competes with numerous electronic design and consulting companies as well as with the internal design capabilities of electronics manufacturers other electronics companies and management consulting firms continue to enter the electronic design and methodology services industries 

 

 proprietary rights could seriously harm its business 

  cadence’s success depends in part upon its proprietary technology many of cadence’s products include software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties and cadence may have to seek new or renew existing licenses for software and other intellectual property in the future cadence’s design services business also requires it to license software or other intellectual property of third parties including that of competitors cadence’s failure to obtain for its use software or other intellectual property licenses or other intellectual property rights on favorable terms or the need to engage in litigation over these licenses or rights could seriously harm cadence’s business operating results and financial condition   also cadence generally relies on patents copyrights trademarks trade secret laws licenses and restrictive agreements to establish and protect its proprietary rights in technology and products despite precautions cadence may take to protect its intellectual property cadence cannot assure you that third parties will not try to challenge invalidate or circumvent these safeguards cadence also cannot assure you that the rights granted under its patents will provide it with any competitive advantages patents will be issued on any of its pending applications or future patents will be sufficiently broad to protect cadence’s technology furthermore the laws of foreign countries may not protect cadence’s proprietary rights in those countries to the same extent as us law protects these rights in the united states   cadence cannot assure you that its reliance on licenses from or to or restrictive agreements with third parties or that patent copyright trademark and trade secret protections will be enough to be successful and profitable in the industries in which cadence competes 

 

   there are numerous patents in the eda industry and new patents are being issued at a rapid rate it is not always economically practicable to determine in advance whether a product or any of its components infringes the patent rights of others as a result from time to time cadence may be forced to respond to or prosecute intellectual property infringement claims to protect its rights or defend a customer’s rights these claims regardless of merit could consume valuable management time result in costly litigation or cause product shipment delays all of which could seriously harm cadence’s business operating results and financial condition in settling these claims cadence may be required to enter into royalty or licensing agreements with the third parties claiming infringement these royalty or licensing agreements if available may not have terms acceptable to cadence being forced to enter into a license agreement with unfavorable terms could seriously harm cadence’s business operating results and financial condition any potential intellectual property litigation could force cadence to do one or more of the following  12 if cadence were forced to take any of these actions cadence’s business and results of operations may be harmed 

 

   cadence depends on several suppliers for certain key components and board assemblies used in its hardwarebased verification products cadence’s inability to develop alternative sources or to obtain sufficient quantities of these components or board assemblies could result in delays or reductions in product shipments in particular cadence currently relies on ibm for the hardware components for cadence’s cobalt tm  mercury tm plus and palladium tm products other disruptions in supply may also occur if there were such a reduction or interruption cadence’s results of operations would be seriously harmed even if cadence can eventually obtain these components from alternative sources a significant delay in cadence’s ability to deliver products would result 

 

 has recently acquired 

  cadence has acquired numerous other businesses before and is likely to acquire other businesses in the future while cadence expects to analyze carefully all potential transactions before committing to them cadence cannot assure you that any transaction that is completed will result in longterm benefits to cadence or its stockholders or that cadence’s management will be able to manage the acquired businesses effectively in addition growth through acquisition involves a number of risks if any of the following events occurs after cadence acquires another business it could seriously harm cadence’s business operating results and financial condition  

 

 foreign economies and the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations 

  cadence has significant operations outside the united states cadence’s revenue from international operations as a percentage of total revenue was approximately 45 for fiscal 2001 and 44 for fiscal 2000 cadence also transacts business in various foreign currencies recent economic and political uncertainty and the volatility of foreign currencies in certain parts of the asiapacific region have had and may continue to have a seriously harmful effect on cadence’s revenue and operating results   fluctuations in the rate of exchange between the us dollar and the currencies of other countries in which cadence conducts business could seriously harm its business operating results and financial condition for example if there is an increase in the rate at which a foreign currency exchanges into us dollars it will take more of the foreign currency to equal a specified amount of us dollars than before the rate increase if cadence prices its products and services in the foreign currency it will receive less in us dollars than it did before the rate increase went into effect if cadence prices its products and services in us dollars an increase in the exchange rate will result in an increase in the price for cadence’s products and services 13 compared to those products of its competitors that are priced in local currency this could result in cadence’s prices being uncompetitive in markets where business is transacted in the local currency cadence’s international operations may also be subject to other risks including 

   cadence expects that revenue from its international operations will continue to account for a significant portion of its total revenue   exposure to foreign currency transaction risk can arise when transactions are conducted in a currency different from the functional currency of a cadence subsidiary a subsidiary’s functional currency is the currency in which it primarily conducts its operations including product pricing expenses and borrowings cadence uses foreign currency forward exchange contracts and purchases foreign currency put options to help protect against currency exchange risks these forward contracts and put options allow cadence to buy or sell specific foreign currencies at specific prices on specific dates increases or decreases in the value of cadence’s foreign currency transactions are partially offset by gains and losses on these forward contracts and put options although cadence attempts to reduce the impact of foreign currency fluctuations significant exchange rate movements may hurt cadence’s results of operations as expressed in us dollars   foreign currency exchange risk occurs for some of cadence’s foreign operations whose functional currency is the local currency the primary effect of foreign currency translation on cadence’s results of operations is a reduction in revenue from a strengthening us dollar offset by a smaller reduction in expenses exchange rate gains and losses on the translation into us dollars of amounts denominated in foreign currencies are included as a separate component of stockholders’ equity 

 

   cadence must comply with us department of commerce regulations in shipping its software products and other technologies outside the united states although cadence has not had any significant difficulty complying with these regulations so far any significant future difficulty in complying could harm cadence’s business operating results and financial condition 

 

   competition for highly skilled employees is very intense cadence’s business depends on the efforts and abilities of its senior management its research and development staff and a number of other key management sales support technical and services personnel the high cost of training new personnel not fully utilizing these personnel or losing trained personnel to competing employers could reduce cadence’s gross margins and harm its business and operating results competition for these personnel is intense particularly in geographic areas recognized as high technology centers such as the silicon valley area where cadence’s principal offices are located and the other locations where it maintains facilities to attract and retain individuals with the requisite expertise cadence may be required to grant large numbers of stock options or other stockbased incentive awards which may be dilutive to existing stockholders cadence may also be required to pay significant base salaries and cash bonuses which could harm its operating results if cadence does not succeed in hiring and retaining candidates with appropriate qualifications it will not be able to grow its business and its 14 operating results will suffer cadence’s failure to attract train motivate and retain key employees would impair its development of new products its ability to provide design and methodology services and the management of its businesses this would seriously harm cadence’s business operating results and financial condition 

if cadence becomes subject to unfair hiring claims cadence could be prevented from hiring needed personnel incur liability for damages and incur substantial costs in defending itself 

  companies in cadence’s industry whose employees accept positions with competitors frequently claim that these competitors have engaged in unfair hiring practices or that the employment of these persons would involve the disclosure or use of trade secrets these claims could prevent cadence from hiring personnel or cause it to incur liability for damages cadence could also incur substantial costs in defending itself or its employees against these claims regardless of their merits defending itself from these claims could also divert the attention of cadence’s management away from its operations errors or defects in cadence’s products and services could expose it to liability and harm its reputation   cadence’s customers use its products and services in designing and developing products that involve a high degree of technological complexity each of which has its own specifications because of the complexity of the systems and products with which cadence works some of its products and designs can be adequately tested only when put to full use in the marketplace as a result its customers or their end users may discover errors or defects in cadence’s software or the systems cadence designs or the products or systems incorporating its design and intellectual property may not operate as expected errors or defects could result in  antitakeover defenses in cadence’s charter bylaws and under delaware law could prevent an acquisition of cadence or limit the price that investors might be willing to pay for cadence common stock 

  provisions of the delaware general corporation law that apply to cadence and its certificate of incorporation could make it difficult for another company to acquire control of cadence for example    all or any one of these factors could limit the price that certain investors would be willing to pay for shares of cadence common stock and could delay prevent or allow cadence’s board of directors to resist an acquisition of cadence even if the proposed transaction was favored by a majority of cadence’s independent stockholders 15 










 item 2 properties   cadence’s headquarters are located in san jose california and cadence owns the related land and buildings additionally cadence owns buildings in india and land and buildings in scotland the total square footage of cadence’s owned buildings is approximately 984000 square feet   cadence leases additional facilities for its sales offices in the united states and various foreign countries and its research and development and design services facilities in the united states and in foreign countries including the united kingdom and india cadence subleases certain of these facilities where space is not fully utilized or has been involved in restructuring activities   cadence believes that these facilities and the undeveloped land it owns adjacent to its current headquarters are adequate for its current needs and that suitable additional or substitute space will be available as needed to accommodate any expansion of cadence’s operations 


 item 3 legal proceedings   from time to time cadence is involved in various disputes and litigation matters that arise in the ordinary course of business these include disputes and lawsuits related to intellectual property mergers and acquisitions licensing contract law distribution arrangements and employee relations matters   cadence filed a complaint in the us district court for the northern district of california on december 6 1995 against avant corporation and certain of its employees or agents for misappropriation of trade secrets copyright infringement conspiracy and other illegal acts involving intellectual property   on january 16 1996 avant filed various counterclaims against cadence and joseph b costello cadence’s former president and chief executive officer and with leave of the court on january 29 1998 filed a second amended counterclaim the second amended counterclaim alleges inter alia that cadence and mr costello had cooperated with the santa clara county california district attorney and initiated and pursued its complaint against avant for anticompetitive reasons engaged in wrongful activity in an attempt to manipulate avant’s stock price and utilized certain pricing policies and other acts to unfairly compete against avant in the marketplace the second amended counterclaim also alleges that certain cadence insiders engaged in illegal insider trading with respect to avant’s stock cadence and mr costello believe that they have meritorious defenses to avant’s claims and each intends to defend such action vigorously by an order dated july 13 1996 the court bifurcated avant’s counterclaim from cadence’s complaint and stayed the counterclaim pending resolution of cadence’s complaint the counterclaim remains stayed   in an order issued on december 19 1997 as modified on january 26 1998 the district court entered a preliminary injunction barring avant from any further infringement of cadence’s copyrights in design framework ii® software or selling licensing or copying such product derived from design framework ii including but not limited to avant’s arccell products on december 7 1998 the district court issued a further preliminary injunction which enjoined avant from selling its aquarius product line cadence posted a 100 million bond in connection with the issuance of the preliminary injunction on july 30 1999 the us court of appeals for the ninth circuit affirmed the preliminary injunction   on july 25 2001 avant was ordered to pay cadence 1946 million in criminal restitution after avant entered a plea of no contest and was found guilty by the superior court of the state of california of conspiracy to take and use cadence’s trade secrets this conspiracy included the theft by avant and certain individuals of cadence intellectual property including software code as well as other trade secrets as of december 29 2001 approximately 1960 million consisting of all of the restitution award plus interest was received this amount was recorded in restructuring asset impairment and unusual items in cadence’s consolidated statements of operations   on september 7 1999 the district court ruled on the parties’ motions for summary adjudication and granted in part and denied in part each party’s motion regarding the scope of a june 6 1994 release agreement between the parties the court held that cadence’s copyright infringement claim against avant is not barred by the release and that cadence may proceed on that claim the court also held that cadence’s 16 trade secret claim based on avant’s use prior to june 1994 of cadence’s design framework ii source code is barred by the release on may 15 2001 the ninth circuit heard oral arguments by both parties on their appeals from the district court’s order on june 11 2001 the ninth circuit certified a question of california law to the california supreme court and stayed the case on october 31 2001 the california supreme court agreed to accept such certification 

  in february 1998 aptix corporation and meta systems inc filed a lawsuit against quickturn design systems inc in the us district court for the northern district of california alleging that quickturn infringed a us patent owned by aptix and licensed to meta in june 2000 the district court entered judgment in favor of quickturn dismissing the complaint and declaring the patent unenforceable the court also granted summary judgment to aptix denying quickturn’s abuse of process counterclaim on september 8 2000 the court ordered aptix to pay 42 million to quickturn as reimbursement of attorneys’ fees and costs it incurred in the litigation aptix appealed the district’s court’s judgment and posted a 20 million bond to secure the judgment on june 8 2001 the us court of appeals for the federal circuit affirmed the district court’s dismissal of quickturn’s abuse of process counterclaim on november 5 2001 the federal circuit vacated the district court’s judgment of unenforceability but affirmed the district court’s dismissal of aptix’s and meta’s complaint and the award of attorneys fees and costs   on january 7 1999 in a suit captioned mentor graphics corporation et al v lobo et al delaware chancery court new castle county civ action no 16843nc “mentor ii” mentor filed and served an amended complaint asserting claims against cadence quickturn and the quickturn board of directors for declaratory and injunctive relief for various alleged breaches of fiduciary duty purportedly owned by quickturn and its board of directors to quickturn’s shareholders in connection with the merger between quickturn and cadence mentor further alleged that cadence aided and abetted quickturn and its board of directors in those purported breaches mentor has not prosecuted the matter since january 1999 in may 2000 mentor advised the delaware chancery court of its objection to the settlement of a companion action brought on behalf of certain quickturn shareholders and sought an award of attorneys’ fees related to its prosecution of mentor ii as well as the prior related action to which cadence was not a party settlement of the companion action is conditioned upon approval of the chancery court and mentor’s not being awarded attorneys’ fee for mentor ii in an order dated august 17 2001 the chancery court denied mentor’s fee application mentor has indicated that it will appeal this order   on july 21 1999 mentor filed suit against quickturn which action is pending in the us district court for the northern district of california civil action no c 995464 mentor has alleged that quickturn’s mercury tm and mercury tm plus hardware emulation systems infringe us patent nos 5777489 and 5790832 allegedly assigned to mentor at quickturn’s request cadence was added as a

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations   the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the fiveyear summary of selected financial data and the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k all references to years represent fiscal years unless otherwise noted except for the historical information contained in this annual report on form 10k the following discussion contains forwardlooking statements based on current expectations that involve certain risks and uncertainties cadence’s actual results could differ materially from those discussed herein factors that could cause actual results or performance to differ materially or contribute to such differences include but are not limited to those discussed below in “results of operations” “disclosures about market risk” and “liquidity and capital resources” overview general   cadence provides comprehensive software and other technology and offers design and methodology services for the product development requirements of the world’s leading electronics companies cadence licenses its leadingedge eda software and hardware technology and provides a range of services to its customers throughout the world to help them optimize their product development processes cadence’s products and services are used by companies to design and develop complex integrated circuits and electronic systems including semiconductors computer systems and peripherals telecommunications and networking equipment mobile and wireless devices automotive electronics consumer products and other advanced electronics   in late 2000 both the us economy in general and the electronics industry in particular began to experience a slowdown the severity of which increased during 2001 this economic slowdown adversely affected the electronics industry and in particular negatively affected cadence sales of design services through tality and sales of hardware emulation products the electronics industry slowdown especially in the semiconductor industry could potentially reduce cadence’s revenue and harm its results of operations throughout 2002 acquisitions   cadence has acquired numerous businesses and is likely to do so in the future these acquisitions are described in more detail in “inprocess technology” and in the notes to cadence’s consolidated financial statements   in december 2001 cadence acquired silicon perspective®corporation or spc a privatelyheld design technology firm for approximately 68 million shares of cadence common stock valued at 1325 million spc provides electronic design tools that bridge the gap between frontend logic designers and the backend physical design process the purchase price could increase if certain predetermined performance goals are achieved in fiscal 2002 and 2003   in february 2001 cadence acquired cadmos design technology inc a privatelyheld design tools firm for approximately 36 million shares of cadence common stock valued at 927 million the acquisition was accounted for as a purchase cadmos provides solutions to the noise problems experienced in ultradeep submicron processes the purchase price will increase up to an additional 488970 shares if certain predetermined performance goals are achieved over the three years following the acquisition tality separation   on july 17 2000 cadence announced its plan to separate its electronics design services group into a new company named tality corporation tality filed a registration statement with the securities and exchange commission for tality’s ipo tality’s separation from cadence was substantially completed on october 4 2000 and the electronic design services business thereafter operated as a subsidiary of cadence as a result of the separation in the third quarter of 2000 cadence recorded deferred stock compensation resulting from tality option grants and sales of tality restricted stock on october 9 2000 cadence announced the 22 postponement of tality’s ipo due to unfavorable market conditions as a result of the postponement of the tality ipo cadence wrote off 28 million of iporelated expenses in the first quarter of 2001 in addition to the 28 million cadence also expensed 20 million of tality separation costs in 2001 related primarily to information systems separation legal and consulting fees on april 17 2001 cadence announced the withdrawal of the tality ipo registration statement tality was reorganized and restructured during the second third and fourth quarters of 2001 and is currently a whollyowned subsidiary of cadence see “unusual items — tality iporelated expense and separation costs” 

restructurings and assets impairments   in 2001 cadence announced a worldwide restructuring plan targeted at reducing workforce and consolidating facilities and assets the restructuring plan was initiated primarily due to the severe downturn in the economic environment in the electronics industry particularly in the united states the restructuring was primarily aimed at reducing excess personnel and capacity costs within its tality subsidiary dedicating cadence’s resources to growth areas and focusing on profit contribution cadence recorded 616 million of restructuring charges associated with the worldwide restructuring plan cadence’s restructuring plan and associated costs consisted of 208 million for reduction in personnel 227 million to downsize and close excess facilities and 166 million of asset impairment charges related to certain longlived assets management estimates that the restructuring will result in annualized cost reductions of approximately 704 million in employee salary and benefit costs and 476 million in facility costs   the restructuring plan resulted in a reduction of 705 employees which were predominately tality employees while employee reductions are across all business functions operating units and geographic regions cadence’s wireless communicationsrelated areas within tality were affected more than other areas in addition the number of temporary and contract workers employed by cadence has been reduced   in february 2002 cadence announced a further restructuring of its tality business to increase its focus on communications ic design and intellectual property used in wireline communications equipment and to no longer provides boardlevel mechanical and packaging services for data and telecommunications equipment as a result tality will reduce its headcount by approximately 200 people the reductions will result in the closure of its ottawa canada lowell massachusetts and noida india design centers a restructuring charge of approximately 250 million will be taken in the first quarter of 2002 for severance facility closure and related asset impairments avant restitution award   on july 25 2001 avant corporation was ordered to pay cadence 1946 million in criminal restitution after avant entered a plea of no contest and was found guilty by the superior court of the state of california of conspiracy to take and use cadence’s trade secrets this conspiracy included the theft by avant and certain individuals of cadence intellectual property including software code as well as other trade secrets as of december 29 2001 approximately 1960 million consisting of all of the restitution award plus interest was received this amount is recorded in restructuring asset impairment and unusual items in cadence’s consolidated statements of operations critical accounting policies cadence’s critical accounting policies are as follows  23 

 

   cadence derives revenue from three sources i product revenue which includes software licensing and hardware sales ii maintenance revenue from software and hardware and iii services revenue as described below significant management judgments and estimates are made and used to determine the revenue recognized in any accounting period material differences may result in the amount and timing of cadence’s revenue for any period if different conditions were to prevail such as a different mix of license types or a different payment history each as described below   cadence applies the provisions of statement of position 972 “software revenue recognition” as amended by statement of position 989 “modification of sop 972 software revenue recognition with respect to certain transactions” to all transactions involving the sale of software products and sales of hardware where the software is not incidental   cadence recognizes product revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists the product has been delivered the fee is fixed and determinable collection of the resulting receivable is probable and vendor specific objective evidence exists to allocate the total fee among all delivered and undelivered elements in the arrangement vendor specific objective evidence of fair value is defined as the value of each element of an arrangement if sold separately and is established when a software vendor demonstrates a history of having sold the element separately and of collecting on that element from a representative sample of arrangements on a consistent basis if vendorspecific objective evidence of fair value does not exist for all elements to support the allocation of the total fee among all delivered and undelivered elements of the arrangement revenue is deferred until such evidence does exist for the undelivered elements or until all elements are delivered whichever is earlier   cadence sells software using three license types these license types are    for term and subscription licenses cadence uses a signed contract as evidence of an arrangement for perpetual licenses hardware sales and maintenance renewals cadence uses a purchase order as evidence of an arrangement sales through its japanese distributor are evidenced by a master agreement governing the relationship together with binding purchase orders on a transactionbytransaction basis for services cadence uses a signed statement of work to evidence an arrangement   software is delivered to customers electronically or on a cdrom with respect to hardware delivery of an entire system is deemed to occur upon installation   cadence assesses whether the fee is fixed and determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction cadence uses installment contracts for term and subscription licenses for which it has established a history of collecting under the original contract without providing concessions on payments products or services the time periods of installment contracts are equal to or less than the time period of the licenses and are generally collected quarterly if different conditions were to prevail and cadence no longer had a history of collecting without providing concessions on term licenses then revenue from term licenses would be required to be recognized ratably over the term of the licenses this change would have a material impact on cadence’s reported results for example approximately 50 of cadence’s software license revenues were derived from term licenses in 2001   cadence assesses collectibility based on a number of factors including the customer’s past payment history and its current creditworthiness if cadence determines that collection of a fee is not reasonably 24 assured cadence defers the revenue and recognizes it at the time collection becomes reasonably assured which is generally upon receipt of cash payment 

  provided all the related conditions discussed above are met cadence recognizes revenue for each software license type as follows    maintenance revenue consists of fees for providing technical support and software updates cadence recognizes all maintenance revenue ratably over the contract term regardless of the software license agreement type for term and perpetual licenses customers renew maintenance agreements annually   services revenue consists primarily of revenue received for performing methodology and design services fixedprice methodology and design service contracts are accounted for using contract accounting which is generally the percentageofcompletion method rather than the completedcontract method and time and materials contracts are accounted for on a monthly basis as work is performed in addition for small fixedpriceprojects such as training classes and small standard methodology service engagements of approximately 10000 in size or less revenue is recognized when the work is completed cadence has a history of accurately estimating project status and the cost to complete projects if different conditions were to prevail where accurate estimates could not be made then the use of the completed contract method would be required and all revenue and costs would be deferred until the project was completed this change would have a material impact on cadence’s reported results estimating valuation allowances and accrued liabilities   the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period   management specifically analyzes accounts receivable and also analyzes historical bad debts customer concentrations customer creditworthiness current economic trends and changes in customer payment terms changes in customer demand and sales returns when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns in any accounting period material differences may result in the amount and timing of revenue and or expenses for any period if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates   cadence has effected restructurings of its business units in the past and has established reserves at the low end of the range of estimable cost as required by accounting standards against outstanding commitments for leased properties that it has vacated these reserves are based upon management’s estimate of the landlord’s willingness to negotiate a termination fee the time require to sublet the properties and the amount of sublet income that might be generated between the date the property was vacated and expiration of the lease for each of the vacated properties these estimates are reviewed and revised quarterly and may result in a substantial increase to restructuring expense should different conditions prevail than were anticipated in original management estimates   cadence assesses the need for reserves on inventory based on forward projections of sales of hardware products that are updated monthly as a result of these projections all inventory value in excess of 12 months’ sales projections except for inventory expected to be used in ongoing service and maintenance of the installed base of customer owned systems is reserved once inventory is reserved the reserve can only be relieved by the subsequent sale or scrapping of the inventory 25 

 

   in preparing its consolidated financial statements cadence is required to estimate its income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates this process involves estimating actual current tax liability together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items such as deferred revenue for tax and accounting purposes these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which are included within the consolidated balance sheet cadence then assesses the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent it believes that recovery is not likely cadence must establish a valuation allowance to the extent cadence establishes a valuation allowance for provision or increases this allowance in a period cadence includes an expense within the tax provision in its consolidated statement of operations   significant management judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets cadence recorded a valuation allowance for 2001 due to uncertainties related to its ability to utilize some of the deferred tax assets primarily consisting of certain net operating losses carried forward and foreign tax credits before they expire the valuation allowance is based on estimates of taxable income by jurisdiction in which cadence operates and the period over which deferred tax assets will be recoverable in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or cadence adjust these estimates in future periods cadence may need to establish an additional valuation allowance which could materially impact financial position and results of operations 

 

   cadence periodically reviews longlived assets certain identifiable intangibles and goodwill related to these assets for impairment in accordance with sfas no 121 “accounting for the impairment of longlived assets and for longlived assets to be disposed of”   for assets to be held and used including acquired intangibles cadence initiates its review whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a longlived asset may not be recoverable recoverability of an asset is measured by comparison of its carrying amount to the expected future undiscounted cash flows without interest charges that the asset is expected to generate any impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair market value significant management judgment is required in the forecasting of future operating results which are used in the preparation of projected discounted cash flows and should different conditions prevail material write downs of net intangible assets andor goodwill could occur   it is reasonably possible that the estimates of anticipated future gross revenue the remaining estimated economic life of the products and technologies or both could differ from those used to assess the recoverability of these costs and result in a writedown of the carrying amount or a shortened life of acquired intangibles in the future   in 2002 statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” became effective and as a result cadence will cease to amortize approximately 3110 million of goodwill in lieu of amortization cadence is required to perform an initial impairment review of goodwill in 2002 and an annual impairment review thereafter cadence expects to complete its initial review during the first quarter of 2002 but does not expect to record an impairment charge upon completion of the initial impairment review however there can be no assurance that at the time the review is completed a material impairment charge will not be recorded 26 results of operations revenue  sources of revenue as a percent of total revenue    product revenue increased 2031 million in 2001 compared to 2000 primarily due to an overall increase in price and volume of license renewal with major customers and to a lesser extent an increase in new sales of cadence’s software products to new customers the increase in sales volume was primarily due to an increase in sales volume of cadence’s integrated circuit implementation products which include synthesis place and route physical design and physical verification products the increases were partially offset by a decrease in quickturn product sales management expects quickturn’s revenue to continue to decline due to the slowdown in the economy and the electronics industry in particular cadence’s software licenses revenue recognized on a ratable basis comprised 32 19 and 11 of software revenue for the years ended 2001 2000 and 1999 respectively   product revenue increased 1220 million in 2000 compared to 1999 primarily due to an overall increase in price and volume of license renewals with major customers the increases in sales volume of products was primarily attributable to increased sales of intellectual propertycreation products which include mixed signal and simulation products integrated circuit implementation products which include place and route physical design and physical verification products and printed circuit boardrelated products   services revenue decreased 726 million in 2001 compared to 2000 primarily due to a reduction in customers’ spending budgets for external services resulting in a decrease in engagements the decrease was the result of the economic slowdown experienced in the telecommunications consumer products and a decline in use of outside services by cadence’s customers cadence believes that the slowdown will continue throughout 2002 tality’s revenue declined 499 million in 2001 compared to 2000 primarily due to fewer active engagements and fewer services hours billed tality’s revenue is expected to continue to be affected by the slowdown in the economy generally and electronics industry specifically and reductions of its workforce in connection with its restructurings methodology services revenue declined 222 million in 2001 compared to 2000 primarily due to a general weakness in customer demand for shortterm consulting services   services revenue increased 411 million in 2000 compared to 1999 primarily due to an increase in tality revenue of 695 million partially offset by a decrease of 284 million in methodology services revenue tality’s revenue increase was primarily due to increases in the total size of active client engagements and total client service hours billed the decrease in methodology services engagements was primarily due to lower staffing levels which were insufficient to service additional projects   maintenance revenue increased 204 million in 2001 compared to 2000 primarily due to the growth of cadence’s installed customer base and the renewal of maintenance and support contracts maintenance revenue increased 232 million in 2000 compared to 1999 primarily due to the growth of the installed customer base 27 revenue by geography  revenue by geography as a percent of total revenue    international revenue increased 862 million in 2001 compared to 2000 primarily due to increases in product revenue worldwide and maintenance revenue in europe and asia partially offset by a decrease in services revenue worldwide   international revenue decreased 77 million in 2000 compared to 1999 primarily due to decreases in product revenue in japan and services revenue in europe and japan partially offset by an increase in product and maintenance revenue in europe   differences in the rate of revenue growth over the periods presented and as compared geographically are primarily due to fluctuations in sales volume of integrated circuit implementation and intellectual property creation products and of cadence’s design and methodology services offerings based upon contractual renewal cycles in europe and a general economic decline in japan   foreign currency exchange rates negatively affected revenue by 199 million in 2001 primarily due to the weakening of the japanese yen foreign currency exchange rates negatively affected revenue by 38 million in 2000 primarily due to the weakening of the british pound and german mark in relation to the us dollar partially offset by the strengthening of the japanese yen in relation to the us dollar additional information about revenue by geographic areas can be found under “segment reporting” in the notes to consolidated financial statements cost of revenue  

cost of revenue as a percent of related revenue    cost of product revenue includes costs of employee salary and benefit costs packaging and documentation royalties and amortization of capitalized development costs for software products manufacturing costs associated with hardware emulation system products include materials labor and overhead 28   cost of product revenue increased 82 million in 2001 compared to 2000 the increase was primarily due to increases in inventory writeoffs partially offset by decreases in manufacturing expenses associated with the decrease in sales of emulation system products in the year ended december 29 2001 cadence recorded an 189 million reserve against inventory in cost of product revenue of the 189 million 152 million of the reserve was related to excess inventory from decreased sales forecasts and 37 million related to two product lines that were discontinued as part of cadence’s restructuring the excess inventory charge of 152 million was due to a sudden and significant decrease in forecasted revenue for emulation products and was calculated in accordance with cadence’s policy which is based on inventory in excess of 12month demand inventory purchases and commitments are based on future sales forecasts cadence typically buys and builds inventory levels for certain key components to mitigate component supply constraints based on cadence’s current 12month demand forecast cadence does not anticipate that the excess inventory subject to these reserves will be used at a later date cost of product revenue increased 104 million in 2000 compared to 1999 the increase was primarily due to increases in manufacturing expenses associated with emulation system products and amortization of capitalized software development costs   because the majority of cadence’s cost of software product revenue does not vary significantly with changes in revenue product gross margin increased in 2001 compared to 2000 primarily due to an increase in volume of license renewals with major customer   cost of services revenue includes costs associated with providing services to customers primarily employee salary and benefits costs to recruit develop and retain personnel and to maintain the infrastructure necessary to manage a services organization as well as provisions for lost contracts if any cost of services revenue decreased 243 million in 2001 compared to 2000 primarily due to decreases in employee salary and benefit costs resulting from cadence’s reduction of services professionals in connection with its restructuring initiated in 2001 cost of services revenue increased 238 million in 2000 compared to 1999 primarily due to an increase in the number of design engineers in tality   services gross margin decreased in 2001 compared to 2000 primarily due to the slowdown in the economy generally and in the electronics systems industry in particular resulting in revenues declining faster than costs services gross margins remained relatively flat in 2000 as compared to 1999 services gross margin has been and may continue to be reduced by cadence’s inability to fully utilize its services resources   cost of maintenance revenue includes the cost of customer services such as hotline and onsite support production personnel packaging and documentation of maintenance updates cost of maintenance increased 20 million in 2001 compared to 2000 primarily due to an increase in employee salary and benefit costs resulting from an increase in employee headcount cost of maintenance revenue increased 97 million in 2000 compared to 1999 primarily due to costs associated with the orcad acquisition and increases in employee salary and benefit costs and costs to invest in customer service the orcad acquisition was completed in the third quarter of 1999 and therefore there were no similar costs in the first seven months of 1999

  marketing and sales   marketing and sales expenses increased 35 million in 2001 compared to 2000 primarily due to an increase in employee salary and benefit costs resulting from an increase in employee headcounts partially offset by a decrease in commissions expense from volume and rate changes marketing and sales expenses increased 359 million in 2000 compared to 1999 primarily due to an increase in employee salary and benefit costs the inclusion of orcadrelated expenses for the full year of fiscal 2000 and marketing program costs partially offset by lower consulting costs research and development   research and development expense prior to the reduction for capitalization of software development costs was 3275 million for 2001 2924 million for 2000 and 2449 million for 1999 representing 23 of total revenue for 2001 and 2000 and 22 for 1999 cadence capitalized software development costs of approximately 302 million for 2001 284 million for 2000 and 257 million for 1999 which represented approximately 9 of total research and development expenditures for 2001 and 10 of research and development expenditures for 2000 and 1999 the increase in capitalized software development costs in each of these three years resulted primarily from increases in new product development projects that have reached technological feasibility in any given period the amount of capitalized software development costs may vary depending on the exact nature of the development performed   the increase in net research and development expenses of 334 million for 2001 compared to 2000 was primarily due to an increase in employee salary and benefit costs resulting from an increase in employee headcount the increase in net research and development expenses of 447 million for 2000 compared to 1999 was primarily attributable to higher employee salary and benefit costs and the inclusion of orcad related costs and expenses for the full year of fiscal 2000 general and administrative   general and administrative expenses increased 201 million in 2001 compared to 2000 primarily due to an increase of employee salary and benefit costs resulting from an increase in employee headcount increases in bad debt expenses related to tality accounts receivable and increased use of outside consulting services general and administrative expenses increased 77 million in 2000 compared to 1999 primarily due to employee salary and benefit costs partially offset by decreases in bad debt expense and consulting and outside services costs   foreign currency exchange rates positively affected operating expenses by 93 million in 2001 compared to 2000 primarily due to the weakening of the japanese yen and british pound in relation to the us dollar foreign currency exchange rates positively affected operating expenses by 38 million in 2000 compared to 1999 primarily due to the weakening of the british pound the german mark and the french franc in relation to the us dollar partially offset by the strengthening of the japanese yen in relation to the us dollar amortization of acquired intangibles  30 amortization of acquired intangibles as a percent of total revenue    amortization of acquired intangibles increased 118 million in 2001 compared to 2000 primarily due to the 2001 acquisition of cadmos partially offset by a reduction attributable to the writeoff of diablo goodwill in the second quarter of 2001 amortization of acquired intangibles increased 187 million in 2000 compared to 1999 primarily due to a full year’s amortization related to cadence’s 1999 acquisitions of orcad and diablo partially offset by the decrease in amortization related to the 133 million asset impairment charge of excellent design inc in the fourth quarter of 1999 for additional information regarding these acquisitions see “inprocess technology” amortization of deferred stock compensation  amortization of deferred stock compensation as a percent of total revenue    cadence records deferred stock compensation resulting from option grants for tality stock sales of tality restricted stock and cadence’s acquisitions of cadmos and spc deferred stock

restricted stock sales to certain cadence executives and employees and the deemed fair market value of tality’s common stock at the time of those grants and sales deferred stock compensation from the cadmos acquisition represents the difference between the exercise price of stock option grants to cadmos employees and the fair market value of cadence’s common stock at the time of acquisition cadence is amortizing the deferred stock compensation to expense over the period during which the stock options and restricted stock vest in the second and third quarters of 2001 cadence repurchased 1740000 restricted tality shares from certain cadence executives and employees who then repaid their related notes payable to cadence tality repurchased 220000 restricted tality shares from three of its directors the purchase price was 610 per share the fair market value of tality stock at the time of repurchase the increase in amortization of deferred stock compensation of 65 million for 2001 when compared to 2000 was primarily due to the absence of similar costs in the first six months of 2000 for the years ended december 29 2001 and december 30 2000 cadence recorded a total of 404 million and 724 million of deferred stock compensation respectively of the 404 million 274 million is related to the acquisition of spc 100 million is related to the acquisition of cadmos and 30 million is related to tality stock option grants of the 724 million 641 million is related to the stock option grants and 83 million is related to the sales of tality restricted stock in 2000 cadence is amortizing the deferred stock compensation over the period during which the stock options and restricted stock were vesting for the year ended december 29 2001 cadence reversed deferred stock compensation of 278 million related to the cancellation of options and the repurchase of tality restricted stock 31 unusual items   described below are unusual items in 2001 2000 and 1999  avant criminal restitution   on july 25 2001 avant corporation was ordered to pay cadence 1946 million in criminal restitution after avant entered a plea of no contest and was found guilty by the superior court of the state of california of conspiracy to take and use cadence’s trade secrets this conspiracy included the theft by avant and certain individuals of cadence intellectual property including software code as well as other trade secrets as of december 29 2001 approximately 1960 million consisting of the entire restitution award plus interest was received this amount was recorded in restructuring asset impairment and unusual items in cadence’s consolidated statements of operations tality iporelated expense and separation costs   in the year ended december 29 2001 cadence recorded 48 million in separation costs of the 48 million 28 million related to the postponement of the tality ipo and 20 million related totality separation costs primarily information systems separation and legal accounting and consulting fees   in the year ended december 30 2000 cadence recorded 68 million in separation costs related to the separation and the related planned ipo of tality cadence’s then newlyformed subsidiary these costs primarily include legal and accounting services strategic business planning information systems separation development of compensation and benefits strategies and recruitment and formation of tality’s senior management team inprocess technology   in december 2001 cadence acquired spc a privatelyheld design technology firm for approximately 68 million shares of cadence stock valued at 1325 million spc provides electronic design tools that bridge the gap between frontend logic designers and the backend physical design process the purchase price could increase if certain predetermined performance goals are achieved in fiscal 2002 and 2003 in connection with the acquisition cadence acquired goodwill of 979 million and technology trademarks employee agreements and other assumed contractual obligations intangibles of 195 million the technology and other acquired intangibles are being amortized over one to five years   upon completion of the spc acquisition cadence immediately charged to expense 86 million representing acquired inprocess technology that had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use the value assigned to acquired inprocess technology was determined by identifying research projects in areas for which technological feasibility has not been established the value was determined by estimating the costs to develop the acquired inprocess technology into commercially viable products estimating the resulting net cash flows from such projects and discounting the net cash flows back to their present value the discount rate included a factor that took into account the uncertainty surrounding the successful development of the acquired inprocess technology the inprocess technology is expected to be 32 commercially viable in 2002 as of december 29 2001 expenditures to complete the inprocess technology totaled 12 million and expenditures to complete the remaining inprocess technology are expected to total approximately 09 million this estimate is subject to change given the uncertainties of the development process and no assurance can be given that deviations from these estimates will not occur additionally these projects will require additional research and development after they have reached a state of technological and commercial feasibility 

  at the time of its acquisition by cadence spc’s inprocess research and development projects were related to the development of a signal integrity analysis and optimization tool and development of an enhanced version of its routingestimation technology these capabilities are important for ic design at and below 013 micron geometries the nature of the efforts to complete these projects related in varying degrees to the completion of all planning designing prototyping verification and testing activities necessary to establish that the proposed technologies meet their design specifications including functional technical and economic performance requirements   the net cash flows resulting from the projects underway at spc used to value the purchased research and development were based on management’s estimates of revenue cost of revenue research and development costs selling general and administrative costs and income taxes from such projects the revenue projections were based on the potential market size that the projects address cadence’s ability to gain market acceptance in these segments and the life cycle of this inprocess technology   estimated total revenue from the acquired inprocess technology is expected to peak in 2004 and decline rapidly thereafter as other new products are expected to enter the market in addition a portion of the anticipated revenue had been attributed to enhancements of the base technology under development and has been excluded from net cash flow calculations existing technology was valued at 84 million the net cash flows generated from the acquired inprocess technology were expected to reflect earnings before interest taxes and depreciation of approximately 35 of the revenue generated from inprocess technology however there can be no assurance that these assumptions will prove accurate or that cadence will realize the anticipated benefit of the acquisition   the discount of the net cash flows to their present value was based on the weighted average cost of capital or wacc the wacc calculation produces the average required rate of return of an investment in an operating enterprise based on the required rates of return from investments in various areas of the enterprise the rate used to discount the net cash flows from purchased inprocess technology was 36 the discount rate is sometimes higher than the wacc due to the inherent uncertainties in the estimates including the uncertainty surrounding the successful development of the acquired inprocess technology the useful life of such technology the profitability levels of such technology if any and the uncertainty of technological advances all of which were unknown at that time   in the three months ended june 30 2001 cadence acquired substantially all of the assets of two companies for a preliminary aggregate price of 105 million of which 44 million was cash and 61 million was shares of cadence common stock plus future contingent payments the acquisitions were accounted for as purchases upon consummation of the acquisitions cadence immediately charged to expense 10 million representing acquired inprocess technology that had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use   in february 2001 cadence acquired cadmos design technology inc a privatelyheld design tools firm for approximately 36 million shares of cadence common stock valued at 927 million the acquisition was accounted for as a purchase cadmos provides solutions to the noise problems experienced in ultradeep submicron processes the purchase price will increase up to an additional 488970 shares if certain predetermined performance goals are achieved over the three years following the acquisition these goals are bookings product development and continued employment of certain cadmos employees in connection with the acquisition cadence preliminarily allocated the purchase price primarily to goodwill of 583 million and technology and other intangibles of 129 million the technology and other acquired intangibles are being amortized over three to five years the results of operations of cadmos and the estimated fair value of the 33 assets acquired and liabilities assumed are included in cadence’s consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition 

  upon consummation of the cadmos acquisition cadence immediately charged to expense 121 million representing acquired inprocess technology that had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use the value assigned to acquired inprocess technology was determined by identifying research projects in areas for which technological feasibility has not been established the value was determined by estimating the costs to develop the acquired inprocess technology into commercially viable products estimating the resulting net cash flows from such projects and discounting the net cash flows back to their present value the discount rate included a factor that took into account the uncertainty surrounding the successful development of the acquired inprocess technology the inprocess technology is expected to be commercially viable in 2002 as of december 29 2001 expenditures to complete the inprocess technology totaled 10 million and expenditures to complete the

that deviations from these estimates will not occur additionally these projects will require additional research and development after they have reached a state of technological and commercial feasibility   at the time of its acquisition by cadence cadmos’ inprocess research and development projects were related to the development of a static timing analysis tool the development of advanced fixing capabilities in the noise analysis area and in the mixed signal area the development of a flow to integrate with cadence tools and a tool to analyze large applicationspecific integrated circuit designs for substrate noise the nature of the efforts to complete these projects related in varying degrees to the completion of all planning designing prototyping verification and testing activities necessary to establish that the proposed technologies meet their design specifications including functional technical and economic performance requirements   the net cash flows resulting from the projects underway at cadmos used to value the purchased research and development were based on management’s estimates of revenue cost of revenue research and development costs selling general and administrative costs and income taxes from such projects the revenue projections were based on the potential market size that the projects address cadence’s ability to gain market acceptance in these segments and the life cycle of this inprocess technology   estimated total revenue from the acquired inprocess technology is expected to peak in 2004 and decline rapidly thereafter as other new products are expected to enter the market in addition a portion of the anticipated revenue had been attributed to enhancements of the base technology under development and has been excluded from net cash flow calculations existing technology was valued at 36 million the net cash flows generated from the acquired inprocess technology were expected to reflect earnings before interest taxes and depreciation of approximately 50 of the revenue generated from inprocess technology however there can be no assurance that these assumptions will prove accurate or that cadence will realize the anticipated benefit of the acquisition   the discount of the net cash flows to their present value was based on the wacc the rate used to discount the net cash flows from purchased inprocess technology was 28 the discount rate is sometimes higher than the wacc due to the inherent uncertainties in the estimates including the uncertainty surrounding the successful development of the acquired inprocess technology the useful life of such technology the profitability levels of such technology if any and the uncertainty of technological advances all of which were unknown at that time   in august 1999 cadence acquired orcad inc a supplier of computeraided engineering and computeraided design software and services for the printed circuit board industry for cash cadence acquired all of the outstanding stock of orcad and assumed all outstanding orcad stock options the purchase price was 1314 million and the acquisition was accounted for as a purchase   upon consummation of the orcad acquisition cadence immediately charged to expense 118 million representing acquired inprocess technology that had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use see “notes to consolidated financial statements” the value assigned to acquired 34 inprocess technology was determined by identifying research projects in areas for which technological feasibility has not been established the value was determined by estimating the costs to develop the acquired inprocess technology into commercially viable products estimating the resulting net cash flows from such projects and discounting the net cash flows back to their present value the discount rate included a factor that took into account the uncertainty surrounding the successful development of the acquired inprocess technology certain acquired inprocess technology was commercially viable in 1999 and other acquired inprocess technology became commercially viable in 2000 expenditures to complete this acquired inprocess technology did not exceed 23 million 

  at the time of its acquisition by cadence orcad’s inprocess research and development projects in the schematic entry area were related to the development of an online component catalog and a new schematic design entry interface inprocess research and development projects in the simulation area were related to a rearchitecture of the simulation engine and replacement of the simulation engine additional features under development included randomized expressions and no selection limits the nature of the efforts to complete these projects related in varying degrees to the completion of all planning designing prototyping verification and testing activities that were necessary to establish that the proposed technologies meet their design specifications including functional technical and economic performance requirements   the net cash flows resulting from the projects underway at orcad used to value the purchased research and development were based on management’s estimates of

expected to peak in 2001 and decline rapidly thereafter as other new products are expected to enter the market in addition a portion of the anticipated revenue had been attributed to enhancements of the base technology under development and had been excluded from net cash flow calculations existing technology was valued at 108 million the net cash flows generated from the acquired inprocess technology were expected to reflect earnings before interest taxes and depreciation of approximately 32 of the sales generated from inprocess technology however there can be no assurance that these assumptions will prove accurate or that cadence will realize the anticipated benefit of the acquisition   the discount of the net cash flows to their present value was based on the wacc the rate used to discount the net cash flows from purchased inprocess technology was 22 the discount rate is sometimes higher than the wacc due to the inherent uncertainties in the estimates including the uncertainty surrounding the successful development of the acquired inprocess technology the useful life of such technology the profitability levels of such technology if any and the uncertainty of technological advances all of which were unknown at that time   in january 1999 cadence acquired design automation inc or dai a supplier of design verification technology used in soc design cadence acquired all of the outstanding stock of dai for approximately 06 million shares of cadence common stock and 29 million of cash the total purchase price was 257 million and the acquisition was accounted for as a purchase   upon consummation of the dai acquisition cadence immediately charged to expense 89 million representing acquired inprocess technology that had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use see “notes to consolidated financial statements — other acquisitions” the value assigned to acquired inprocess technology was determined by identifying research projects in areas for which technological feasibility has not been established the value was determined by estimating the costs to develop the acquired inprocess technology into commercially viable products estimating the resulting net cash flows from such projects and discounting the net cash flows back to their present value the discount rate included a factor that took into account the uncertainty surrounding the successful development of the acquired inprocess technology certain acquired inprocess technology under development at the time of acquisition was initially expected to become commercially viable in 1999 but instead became viable in 2000 expenditures to complete this inprocess technology did not exceed 15 million 35   at the time of its acquisition by cadence dai had several significant research and development projects in process that were intended to provide a next generation environment for design verification and analysis these efforts included the development of a highly automated approach for highlevel test bench creation and analysis a waveform viewer capable of supporting analog and mixed signal designs and a tool designed to analyze verification code coverage at the transactional level the nature of the efforts to complete these inprocess research and development projects related in varying degrees to the completion of all planning designing prototyping verification and testing activities that were necessary to establish that the proposed inprocess technologies meet their design specifications which include functional technical and economic performance requirements   the net cash flows generated by the projects underway at dai used to value the acquired inprocess technology were based on management’s estimates of revenue cost of revenue research and development costs selling general and administrative costs and income taxes from such projects the revenue projections were based on the potential market size that these projects address cadence’s ability to gain market acceptance for these projects and the life cycle of this inprocess technology   estimated total revenue from the acquired inprocess technology is expected to peak in 2001 through 2002 and decline rapidly thereafter as other new products are expected to enter the market in addition a portion of the anticipated revenue has been attributed to enhancements of the base technology under development and has been excluded from net cash flow calculations existing technology was valued at 114 million at the time of acquisition the net cash flows generated from the acquired inprocess technology are expected to reflect earnings before interest taxes and depreciation of approximately 60 of the sales generated from inprocess technology however there can be no assurance that these assumptions will prove accurate or that cadence will realize the anticipated benefits of this acquisition   the discount applied to the net cash flows to calculate the present value of such net cash flows was based on the wacc the rate used to discount the net cash flows from purchased inprocess technology was 22 acquired intangibles writeoffs   in reaction to the current decline in business conditions generally and the wireless communications industry in particular cadence restructured certain of its businesses and realigned resources to focus on profit contribution highgrowth markets and core opportunities as a result cadence recorded a charge of 258 million in 2001 related to the impairment of goodwill and acquired intangibles associated with the acquisition of diablo a part of tality key factors in this writeoff were significant downsizing or reassignment of personnel directly related to these assets and abandonment of most of diablo’s line of business the charge was determined as the amount by which the carrying value of the intangible assets associated with diablo’s acquisition exceeded the fair value of those assets   in 1999 cadence incurred a total of 199 million in asset impairment charges of this amount 133 million represented asset impairment of acquired intangibles from the excellent design or exd acquisition this asset impairment charge resulted from reduced japanese sales and the loss of key exd employees which together resulted in diminished cash flow projections cadence entered into certain support agreements with third parties to provide support for exd software tools previously sold by cadence customers the fair value of the exd acquired intangibles was based on an evaluation of the present value of the estimated expected future cash flows discounted at 16 the remaining 66 million in asset impairment charges were incurred in connection with the cancellation of an information technology services contract with a thirdparty the abandonment of capitalized software development costs associated with certain cadence products that were discontinued and the abandonment of certain thirdparty software licenses related to research and development restructurings charges and asset impairments   in 2001 cadence announced a worldwide restructuring and asset impairment plan targeted at reducing workforce and consolidating facilities and assets the restructuring plan was initiated primarily due to the severe downturn in the economic environment in the united states particularly in the electronics industry 36 the restructuring was primarily aimed at reducing excess personnel and capacity costs within its tality subsidiary dedicating cadence’s resources to growth areas and focusing on profit contribution cadence recorded 616 million of restructuring charges classified as unusual operating expenses associated with the worldwide restructuring plan cadence’s restructuring plan and associated costs consisted of 208 million for reduction in personnel 227 million to downsize and close excess facilities and 166 million of asset impairment charges related to certain longlived assets management estimates that the restructuring will result in annualized cost reductions of approximately 704 million in employee salary and benefit costs and 476 million in facility costs 

  the restructuring plan resulted in a reduction of 705 employees which were predominately tality employees while employee reductions are across all business functions operating units and geographic regions cadence’s wireless communicationsrelated areas within tality were affected more than other areas in addition the number of temporary and contract workers employed by cadence has been reduced severance costs resulting from the restructuring included severance benefits notice pay and outplacement services as the result of the separation of tality from cadence approximately 53 million of the restructuring charges was paid to certain tality employees who were participants in cadence’s employee stock purchase plan prior to tality’s separation from cadence in october 2000 all terminations and termination benefits were communicated to the affected employees prior to december 29 2001 all severance benefits will be paid out before the end of the first quarter of 2002   facilities consolidation charges of 227 million were incurred in connection with the downsizing and closing of 16 sites closure and downsizing costs included payments required under lease contracts less any applicable estimated sublease income after the properties were abandoned lease buyout costs restoration costs associated with certain lease arrangements and costs to maintain facilities during the period after abandonment to determine the lease loss which is the loss after cadence’s cost recovery efforts from subleasing a building certain assumptions were made related to the 1 time period over which the relevant building would remain vacant 2 sublease terms and 3 sublease rates including common area charges the lease loss is an estimate under statement of financial accounting standards no 5 accounting for contingencies and represents the low end of the range as required by this statement 131 million which will be adjusted in the future upon triggering events eg change in estimate of time to sublease actual sublease rates etc cadence has estimated that the high end of the lease loss could be 528 million if facilities operating lease rental rates continue to decrease in the applicable markets or if it takes longer than expected to find a suitable tenant to sublease the facility as of december 29 2001 six sites had been vacated and eight sites had been downsized   assetrelated charges of 166 million consisted primarily of 139 million of leasehold improvements for facilities and other fixed assets that were either abandoned or for which the resulting estimated future reduced cash flows were insufficient to cover the associated expenses cadence also recorded 22 million of assetrelated charges for abandoned software and 15 million related to consulting services performed to restructure the research and development process   in 1999 cadence recorded 133 million of restructuring charges that consisted of 113 million to terminate approximately 100 employees and 20 million to downsize and close excess facilities cadence’s restructuring plans were primarily aimed at reducing costs after cadence merged with quickturn further restructuring of cadence’s services business in japan and severance resulting from the resignation of cadence’s former chief executive officer severance costs include severance benefits notice pay and outplacement services all terminations and termination benefits were communicated to the affected employees prior to yearend and substantially all remaining severance benefits were paid in 2000   facilities consolidation charges of 20 million were incurred in connection with the closure of 15 quickturn facilities including 10 million to close duplicate and excess facilities and 10 million of abandonment costs for the related leasehold improvements closure and exit costs include payments required under lease contracts less any applicable sublease income after the properties were abandoned lease buyout costs restoration costs associated with certain lease arrangements and costs to maintain facilities during the period after abandonment asset related writeoffs consist of leasehold improvements of facilities that were 37 abandoned and whose estimated fair market value is zero as of december 29 2001 14 of the 15 quickturn sites had been vacated noncancelable lease payments on vacated facilities will be paid through 2003 

  liabilities for excess facilities and other restructuring charges are included in accrued and other longterm liabilities while severance and benefits liabilities are included in payroll and payrollrelated accruals actual amounts of termination benefits facilities and other restructuringrelated payments can be found in notes to consolidated financial statements under “restructuring asset impairment and unusual items” merger costs   in connection with the acquisition of quickturn in 1999 cadence charged to expense merger costs of 84 million representing professional fees for financial advisors attorneys and accountants litigation settlement   in 1999 cadence and mentor announced the settlement of a patent infringement action pending in the us district court for the district of oregon as a result the court entered a judgment declaring that certain quickturn patents are valid enforceable and were infringed by mentor’s sale of simexpress products in the united states mentor is permanently enjoined from producing marketing or selling simexpress emulation systems in the united states in connection with the settlement mentor paid cadence 30 million other income net   other income net for 2001 2000 and 1999 is as follows    other income net decreased 29 million in 2001 when compared to 2000 primarily due to a decrease in foreign exchange gains partially offset by an increase in interest income other income net increased 32 million in 2000 when compared to 1999 primarily due to an increase in foreign exchange gains partially offset by 22 million of investment losses from telos venture partners lp in which cadence holds a limited partnership interest shown in other expense net income taxes   the provision for income taxes and the effective tax rates for 2001 2000 and 1999 are as follows    as of december 29 2001 cadence had total net deferred tax assets of approximately 664 million realization of the deferred tax assets will be dependent on generating sufficient taxable income prior to the expiration of certain net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards although realization is not assured management believes that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets will be realized the 38 amount of the net deferred tax assets however could be reduced or increased in the near term if actual facts including the estimate of future taxable income differ from those estimated 

  the 2001 effective tax rate includes the approximately 1960 million received from avant as criminal restitution the writeoff of acquired inprocess technology of approximately 217 million and stock compensation amortization of approximately 179 million the effective tax rate excluding the avant restitution proceeds the writeoff of acquired inprocess technology and stock compensation was 265 the effective tax rate for 1999 includes the writeoff of acquired inprocess technology of approximately 207 million the effective tax rate for 1999 excluding the writeoff of acquired inprocess technology was 289 disclosures about market risk interest rate risk   cadence’s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to its investment portfolio while cadence is exposed to interest rate fluctuations in many of the world’s leading industrialized countries cadence’s interest income and expense is most sensitive to fluctuations in the general level of us interest rates in this regard changes in us interest rates affect the interest earned on cadence’s cash and cash equivalents shortterm and longterm investments and interest paid on its longterm debt obligations as well as costs associated with foreign currency hedges   cadence invests in high quality credit issuers and by policy limits the amount of its credit exposure to any one issuer as part of its policy cadence’s first priority is to reduce the risk of principal loss consequently cadence seeks to preserve its invested funds by limiting default risk market risk and reinvestment risk cadence mitigates default risk by investing in only high quality credit securities that it believes to be low risk and by positioning its portfolio to respond appropriately to a significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor the portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity   on september 29 2000 cadence entered into two syndicated senior unsecured credit facilities that allow cadence to borrow up to 3600 million these two credit facilities are referred to as the 2000 facilities one of the 2000 facilities is a 1000 million threeyear revolving credit facility which terminates on september 29 2003 referred to as the threeyear facility the other 2000 facility referred to as the 364day facility consists of a 2600 million 364day revolving credit facility convertible into a term loan the 364day facility will terminate on september 27 2002 at which time loans outstanding thereunder may be converted to a oneyear term loan with a maturity date of september 29 2003 or at the request of cadence and with the consent of members of the bank group that wish to do so the facility may be extended for one additional 364day period with respect to the portion of the 364day facility outstanding loans that a consenting bank holds for both of the 2000 facilities cadence has the option to pay interest based on libor plus a spread of between 125 and 150 based on a pricing grid tied to a financial covenant or the higher of i the federal funds rate plus 050 or ii the prime rate as a result cadence’s interest expense associated with borrowings under the 2000 facilities will vary with market rates in addition commitment fees are payable on the unused portion of the threeyear facility at rates between 025 and 034 based on a pricing grid tied to a financial covenant and on the unused portion of the 364day facility at a fixed rate of 0225 a utilization fee of 025 is payable on amounts borrowed under the 364day facility whenever combined borrowings under the two 2000 facilities exceed 1188 million cadence may not borrow under the 364day facility at any time that any portion of the threeyear facility remains unused the 2000 facilities contain certain financial and other covenants which must be maintained the financial covenants specify that cadence must maintain a minimum ebitda of not less than 2000 million additionally cadence must maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio the ratio of ebitda to the sum of i interest expense plus ii 20 of funded debt plus iii taxes paid in cash less iv capital lease payments of not less than 15 to 10 other covenants require cadence to maintain a minimum onetoone ratio of current assets to current liabilities and a maximum twotoone funded debt to ebitda ratio from time to time cadence borrows under the 2000 facilities at december 29 2001 there were no borrowings outstanding 39   the table below presents the carrying value and related weighted average interest rates for cadence’s interest bearing instruments all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase are considered to be cash equivalents investments with original maturities between three and 12 months are considered to be shortterm investments investments with original maturities greater than 12 months are considered longterm investments as of december 29 2001 all of cadence’s investments have maturities of less than 12 months the carrying value approximated fair value at december 29 2001  foreign currency risk   cadence’s operations include transactions in foreign currencies and as such cadence benefits from a weaker dollar and is adversely affected by a stronger dollar relative to major currencies worldwide accordingly the primary effect of foreign currency transactions on cadence’s results of operations is a reduction in revenue from a strengthening us dollar offset by a smaller reduction in expenses   cadence enters into foreign currency forward exchange contracts with financial institutions to protect against currency exchange risks associated with existing assets and liabilities a foreign currency forward exchange contract acts as a hedge by increasing in value when underlying asset exposures decrease in value or underlying liability exposures increase in value conversely a foreign currency forward exchange contract decreases in value when underlying asset exposures increase in value or underlying liability exposures decrease in value forward contracts are not accounted for as hedges and therefore the unrealized gains and losses are recognized in other income net in advance of the actual foreign currency cash flows with the fair value of these forward contracts being recorded as accrued liabilities   cadence also purchases foreign currency put options from financial institutions to hedge the currency exchange risks associated with probable but not firmly committed transactions although there were no foreign currency put options outstanding in 2001 cadence may choose to use put options in the future a foreign currency put option acts as a hedge by increasing in value as the underlying transactional value decreases probable but not firmly committed transactions consist of revenue from cadence’s products and maintenance contracts in a currency other than the functional currency these transactions are made through cadence’s subsidiaries in ireland and japan the premium costs of the put options are recorded in prepaid expenses and other current assets while the gains and losses are deferred and recognized in income in the same period as the hedged transaction gains and losses on accounting hedges realized before the settlement date of the related hedged transaction are also generally deferred and recognized in income in the same period as the hedged transaction   cadence does not use forward contracts and put options for trading purposes cadence’s ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to currency fluctuations will depend on the currency exchange rates in effect as the forward contracts and put options mature 40   the table below provides information as of december 29 2001 about cadence’s forward foreign currency contracts as of december 29 2001 there were no put options outstanding the information is provided in us dollar equivalent amounts the table presents the notional amounts at contract exchange rates and the weighted average contractual foreign currency exchange rates these forward contracts mature prior to march 14 2002    while cadence actively manages its foreign currency risks on an ongoing basis there can be no assurance that cadence’s foreign currency hedging activities will substantially offset the impact of fluctuations in currency exchange rates on its results of operations cash flows and financial position on a net basis foreign currency fluctuations did not have a material impact on cadence’s results of operations and financial position during the year ended december 29 2001 the realized gain loss on the forward contracts as they matured was not material to the

   cadence repurchases shares of its common stock under its stock repurchase program repurchased shares may be used for general corporate purposes including the share issuance requirements of cadence’s employee stock option and purchase plans and acquisitions as part of this repurchase programs cadence has purchased and will purchase call options or has sold and will sell put warrants to mitigate equity price risk associate with its stock repurchase program the put warrants if exercised and settled by physical delivery of shares would entitle the holder to sell shares of cadence common stock to cadence at a specified price similarly the call options entitle cadence to buy shares of cadence common stock at a specified price cadence has the option to elect “net share settlement” rather than physical settlement of put warrants that are exercised that is cadence has the right to settle the exercised put warrants with shares of cadence common stock valued at the difference between the exercise price and the fair value of the stock at the date of exercise these transactions may result in sales of a large number of shares and consequent decline in the market price of cadence common stock cadence’s stock repurchase program includes the following characteristics  41    the table below provides information as of december 29 2001 about cadence’s outstanding put warrants and call options the table presents the contract amounts and the weighted average strike prices the put warrants and call options expire on various dates through may 2002 and cadence has the contractual ability to settle the options prior to their maturity  liquidity and capital resources   at december 29 2001 cadence’s principal sources of liquidity consisted of 2748 million of cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments compared to 1370 million at december 30 2000 and two syndicated senior unsecured credit facilities totaling 3600 million as of december 29 2001 cadence had no outstanding borrowings under these credit facilities   cash provided by operating activities increased 1071 million to 2509 million at december 29 2001 as compared to the year ended december 30 2000 primarily due to higher net income before depreciation and amortization and unusual items in 2001   at december 29 2001 cadence had net working capital of 1625 million as compared with 653 million at december 30 2000 the working capital increase was driven primarily by increases in cash and cash equivalents of 1211 million shortterm investments of 167 million and a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of 146 million partially offset by a decrease in net receivables of 311 million and prepaid expenses and other of 267 million   in addition to its shortterm investments cadence’s primary investing activities in 2001 consisted of acquisitions and the related acquired intangibles purchases of property plant and equipment capitalization of software development costs and venture capital partnership investments which combined represented 2121 million at december 29 2001 compared to 1837 million at december 30 2000 of cash used for investing activities   cadence sells put warrants and purchases call options through private placements see “disclosures about market risk — equity price risk” above at december 29 2001 cadence had a maximum potential obligation related to put warrants to buy back 29 million shares of its common stock at an aggregate price of approximately 612 million these put warrants expire at various dates through may 2002 and cadence has the contractual ability to settle the put warrants and call options prior to their maturity cadence has the 42 ability to settle these put warrants with its stock and therefore no amount was classified out of stockholders’ equity in cadence’s consolidated balance sheets 

  cadence has made permanent investments of assets including cash in foreign countries for which no us tax has been provided at december 29 2001 the cumulative amount of earnings upon which us income taxes have not been provided are 5010 million at december 29 2001 the unrecognized deferred tax liability for these earnings was 847 million   cadence has entered into agreements whereby it may transfer qualifying accounts receivables for which cadence has recognized the related revenue to certain financing institutions on a nonrecourse basis these transfers are recorded as sales and accounted for in accordance with sfas no 140 “accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities” during the fiscal years ended december 29 2001 and december 30 2000 cadence transferred accounts receivable totaling 2358 million and 2012 million respectively which approximated fair value to financing institutions on a nonrecourse basis transfers of accounts receivable for cash are reported in cadence’s consolidated statements of cash flows as a financing activity   cadence also purchased 2990 million of its stock and reissued 999 million of stock through its employee option and stock purchase programs   as part of its overall investment strategy cadence is a limited partner in telos lp a venture capital fund and is committed to invest up to 1000 million as of december 29 2001 cadence had contributed approximately 764 million to the fund net of operating expenses   on september 29 2000 cadence entered into two syndicated senior unsecured credit facilities that allow cadence to borrow up to 3600 million these two credit facilities are referred to as the 2000 facilities one of the 2000 facilities is a 1000 million threeyear revolving credit facility that terminates on september 29 2003 referred to as the threeyear facility the other 2000 facility referred to as the 364day facility consists of a 2600 million 364day revolving credit facility convertible into a term loan the 364day facility will terminate on september 27 2002 at which time loans outstanding thereunder may be converted to a oneyear term loan with a maturity date of september 29 2003 or at the request of cadence and with the consent of members of the bank group that wish to do so the facility may be extended for one additional 364day period with respect to the portion of the 364day facility outstanding loans that a consenting bank holds for both of the 2000 facilities cadence has the option to pay interest based on libor plus a spread of between 125 and 150 based on a pricing grid tied to a financial covenant or the higher of i the federal funds rate plus 050 or ii the prime rate as a result cadence’s interest expense associated with borrowings under the 2000 facilities will vary with market rates in addition commitment fees are payable on the unused portion of the threeyear facility at rates between 025 and 034 based on a pricing grid tied to a financial covenant and on the unused portion of the 364day facility at a fixed rate of 0225 a utilization fee of 025 is payable on amounts borrowed under the 364day facility whenever combined borrowings under the two 2000 facilities exceed 1188 million cadence may not borrow under the 364day facility at any time that any portion of the threeyear facility remains unused the 2000 facilities contain certain financial and other covenants which must be maintained the financial covenants specify that cadence must maintain a minimum ebitda of not less than 2000 million additionally cadence must maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio the ratio of ebitda to the sum of i interest expense plus ii 20 of funded debt plus iii taxes paid in cash less iv capital lease payments of not less than 15 to 10 other covenants require cadence to maintain a minimum onetoone ratio of current assets to current liabilities and a maximum twotoone funded debt to ebitda ratio from time to time cadence borrows under the 2000 facilities   cadence anticipates that current cash and shortterm investment balances cash flow from operations and its 3600 million revolving credit facilities will be sufficient to meet its working capital and capital requirements on a shortand longterm basis 43 new accounting standards   in august 2001 the fasb issued sfas no 143 “accounting for obligations associated with the retirement of longlived assets” sfas no 143 addresses financial accounting and reporting for the retirement obligation of an asset this statement provides that companies should recognize the asset retirement cost at its fair value as part of the cost of the asset and classify the accrued amount as a liability in the condensed consolidated balance sheet the asset retirement liability is then accreted to the ultimate payout as interest expense the initial measurement of the liability would be subsequently updated for revised estimates of the discounted cash outflows the statement will be effective for fiscal years beginning after june 15 2002 cadence has not yet determined the effect sfas no 143 will have on its consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows   in june 2001 the fasb issued sfas no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” sfas no 142 addresses financial accounting and reporting for acquired goodwill and other acquired assets it addresses how intangible assets that are acquired individually or with a group of other assets but not those acquired in a business combination should be accounted for in financial statements upon their acquisition this statement also addresses how goodwill and other intangible assets should be accounted for after they have been initially recognized in the financial statements with the adoption of this statement goodwill is no longer subject to amortization over its estimated useful life goodwill will be assessed for impairment each year using the fairvaluebased test this statement becomes effective january 1 2002 cadence is currently analyzing the impact of sfas 142 and expects to complete its analysis by the end of its fiscal quarter ended march 30 2002 as of december 29 2001 cadence had existing net goodwill and identifiable assets of 3963 million cadence expects that upon adoption of sfas 142 cadence would no longer record annual fiscal year amortization associated with existing goodwill of approximately 3110 million   in june 2001 the fasb issued sfas no 141 “business combinations” sfas no 141 addresses financial accounting and reporting for business combinations and it requires business combinations in the scope of this statement to be accounted for using one method the purchase method the provisions of this statement apply to all business combinations initiated

factors driving electronic design automation industry

     the worldwide electronics industry has experienced expansion driven
primarily by the communications networking and wireless markets the rise in
internet and cell phone use pressures electronics suppliers to provide equipment
that meets the everincreasing demand for bandwidth the advent of technologies
such as third generation cellular wireless networking and optical networking
are converging the internet and the cell phone the next step pervasive
connection of consumer electronic devices appears closer to becoming reality
on the electronics production side everdecreasing silicon manufacturing
process geometries coupled with the move to 300mm wafer production is driving
integrated circuit or ic costs volumes and increasingly higher complexities
these market and technology forces pose major challenges for the global
electronics design community and consequently create significant opportunities
and challenges for eda tools and services providers

     the electronics industry is faced with increasing complexity of electronic
devices design teams face two major challenges in deep submicron design and
systemonchip or soc design

     deep submicron design refers to the design of integrated circuits that will
have feature sizes smaller than 12 micron ic feature sizes for wires
transistors and contacts decrease with each advance in the semiconductor
manufacturing process each successive move to a smaller feature size eg
decreasing from 25 microns to 18 microns and smaller requires introducing new
capabilities throughout the entire design and manufacturing flow to account for
new physical effects that emerge from the decrease in size deep submicron
design represents a major challenge for the entire semiconductor industry

     soc design refers to implementing an entire electronics subsystem on a
single ic smaller feature sizes make it more economical to put additional
circuitry on a single die the chips fabricated with these dies include one or
more processors microprocessors and digital signal processors a
highperformance bus numerous memory devices and peripherals custom digital
logic custom analog logic and millions of lines of software code such devices
offer huge benefits in terms of price performance power and size however
they

                                        3
page   4

are extremely difficult to design and it is even more difficult to ensure that
they exhibit the correct behavior under all circumstances a process known as
functional verification

     these trends pose significant new challenges for electronic design teams
deep submicron design requires designers to take into account many physical
effects they previously ignored soc design requires new approaches to managing
complexity and its related risks the industry addresses these challenges in a
number of ways including utilizing new eda tools and upgrading design
methodologies

electronic design

     the electronic design process involves describing the behavioral
architectural functional and structural attributes of an ic or electronic
system the process is one of successive refinement where the design team adds a
level of detail to the design and verifies the results of the addition before
proceeding to add each next level of detail design teams begin with very
abstract behavioral models of their system and end with a physical description
of millions of transistors and their interconnections semiconductor foundries
use the physical description to create the masks and test programs needed to
manufacture the ics eda tools aid the design team in capturing its design
intent creating the next level of detail and verifying the results problems
are often found at one level that can only be resolved by revising a previous
level of description these iterations introduce delay and risk into the design
process

system level design

     decisions made during system level design including behavioral
algorithmic and architectural definition determine a substantial majority of
an electronic systems final performance and cost the behavioral definition
specifies which functions the system needs to perform the algorithmic
definition is a mathematical model that describes any signal processing
necessary to condition video and audio data streams the architectural
definition specifies the highlevel structure of the designs implementation
this includes hardwaresoftware partitioning a process which specifies whether
each behavioral and algorithmic function is to be implemented in hardware or
software

     many companies are adopting a platformbased design approach to address the
complexity of soc design platformbased design defines a robust flexible
platform of preverified virtual components including processors memories and
peripherals tuned for a particular application or set of applications eg
digital video or cellular communications once established design teams create
a new soc rapidly using mostly existing virtual components and complete the
design without requiring much new circuitry or new software this approach can
reduce timetomarket and risk dramatically but also poses a series of new
methodology and automation challenges

functional verification

     the first step in digital hardware design is to create a detailed
functional specification using a hardware description language or hdl
generally using verilogr or vhdlr the functional specification does not
include physical attributes such as timing power and size both verilog and
vhdl specify functionality at various levels of abstraction from behavioral
most abstract to gatelevel most detailed many design teams begin with a
behavior specification as it can be written and functionally verified quickly
afterwards these teams manually rewrite the specification at the
registertransferlevel or rtl of abstraction which specifies the
functionality between each of the individual storage elements also known as
registers within the design many design teams skip the behavioral design and
verification phase and begin with rtl

     to verify their designs teams create elaborate testbenches testbenches
are tests that simulate the inputs a design will likely experience in its actual
application testbenches often include environmental models eg channel
distortion effects for wireless designs processor models running
representative software models for other hardware in the system and checks
that determine whether or not the design exhibits the appropriate behavior
teams perform functional verification by simulating their design and its
testbench thus identifying logical errors to be corrected design teams can
proceed to implement the design using automated digital or custom design
techniques after extensive errorfree rtl functional verification any
undetected functional

                                        4
page   5

error potentially requires a very expensive design change that requires
discarding any silicon manufactured to date and manufacturing new silicon with
the change since even the fastest softwarebased simulation runs many orders of
magnitude slower than the eventual silicon implementation design teams
increasingly employ specialized hardware to increase the process speed by up to
a few orders of magnitude

automated digital ic design

     most design teams use an automated digital methodology for the majority of
their digital hardware design although designers write the rtl and specify the
designs physical constraints they use tools to automatically create the
detailed implementation digital design flows let teams gain better
timetomarket than fullcustom design but sacrifices silicon performance
power and size

     the first step in a automated digital methodology ie mostly automated
is the use of a logic synthesis tool to create a gatelevel version of the
design at the gate level the functionality between registers is elaborated to
logic gates or standard cells at this point the design is a network of
interconnected standard cells and hard cores or previously implemented logic
both the standard cells and the cores are based on a specific manufacturing
process technology for a specific foundry design teams verify that the
gatelevel description is functionally equivalent to the original rtl
specification to identify any potential problems that occurred during this logic
synthesis

     the next step in automated digital design is the design layout designers
determine where the major blocks of circuitry should be located on the physical
die to provide the lowest cost chips meeting the requisite performance
requirements they use this floorplan to guide an automated placement and
routing tool to determine the precise location for every cell and then connect
the cells this step is commonly referred to as placeandroute since the
precise physical implementation is unknown prior to layout it is impossible to
accurately predict the ics physical characteristics before this stage rough
estimates are available at the gate level but with deep submicron physical
effects these estimates are not sufficiently accurate to ensure the design will
work properly in silicon at the level of approximately 018 micron logic
synthesis tools must take placement and routing into account and placeandroute
tools must be able to reoptimize the logic to converge on the designs
performance requirements

     physical verification and analysis is the final step before release of a
design to manufacturing physical verification ensures that the design abides by
all of the detailed rules and parameters that the foundry specifies for its
manufacturing process violating a single foundry rule can result in silicon
that does not work physical analysis is a set of capabilities such as
crosstalk analysis that guard against new physical effects that are important
to consider in deep submicron design

custom ic analog and mixedsignal design

     in general it is possible to achieve considerably higherperformance
lowercost digital circuits by designing them directly at the layout level this
approach is known as custom design because designers can craft every cell by
hand and every interconnection between cells for a design with millions of
cells this process is extremely timeconsuming and risks of error are
significant automated custom physical design techniques considerably speed the
process by automating many common layout tasks and by making intelligent
incremental implementation decisions the designer can accept or reject design
teams generally use this custom design approach for designs that are very
performance and costsensitive such as microprocessors memories and
fieldprogrammable gate arrays even in these cases teams often use automated
digital techniques where possible

     analog design is a form of custom design for analog circuits which requires
specialized tools and techniques analog designers use a bottomup approach
rather than the topdown approach automated digital designers use they
handcraft each analog component based on very detailed processspecific
analysis then repeat the process when they combine the components into an
analog circuit unlike digital designs in which signals are clearly either on
or off beyond a specified threshold the exact value of a signal is almost
always critical in analog design analog circuits are extremely sensitive to any
variation in the surrounding circuitry and environment eg heat power and
electromagnetic effects despite these problems design

                                        5
page   6

teams are combining more and more analog and digital circuitry on the same
design known as mixedsignal design to take advantage of the performance
cost reliability size and power advantages inherent in mixed signal designs

printed circuit board design and ic packaging

     electronic systems invariably consist of one or more printed circuit
boards or pcbs in addition to their mechanical role pcbs interconnect and
provide power to individual ics as ic performance and complexity increase
designing the board that interconnects the ics becomes increasingly difficult
the challenge starts with the ic package itself as ic inputoutput densities
and speeds increase ic packages become an integral part of systemlevel
performance highspeed package design is no longer just a mechanical task but
involves precise layout modeling and analysis likewise highspeed pcb design
involves more than layout it requires analysis to ensure each signal reaches
its destination on time and to identify potential signal integrity problems

phase of product development and offers assistance in the management of clients
supply chains through the application of its indepth knowledge of and
experience in technical and business management processes

methodology services

     cadences methodology services group offers a variety of services to help
customers address electronic design challenges it leverages cadences
cumulative experience and knowledge of industry best practices to improve design
productivity

marketing and sales

     cadence generally uses a direct sales force consisting of sales people and
applications engineers to license its products and market its consulting and
design services to prospective customers applications engineers provide
technical presales as well as postsales support for software products the
cadence methodology services group provides onsite capabilities to help
customers improve productivity with cadence and other eda products tality
offers complete design services to its customers due to the complexity of eda
products and the electronic design process in general the sales cycle is
generally long three to six months or more during the sales cycle the
cadence direct sales force generally provides technical presentations product
demonstrations and onsite customer evaluations of cadence software cadence
also uses traditional marketing approaches to promote its products and services
including advertising direct mail telemarketing trade shows public
relations and the internet

     cadence markets and supports its products and services internationally
except in japan through its subsidiaries and various distributors cadence
markets its consulting and design services in japan through a whollyowned
subsidiary since the reorganization of cadences distribution channel in japan
in 1997 cadence has licensed its products through innotech corporation in
which cadence is an approximately 15 stockholder as of december 30 2000

     a summary of cadences net revenue and longlived assets by geographic area
is set forth in the segment reporting note to the consolidated financial
statements which information is incorporated herein by reference prices for
international customers are quoted in a local currency from an international
price list the list is prepared based on the us dollar price list but
reflects the higher cost of doing business outside the united states
international customers are invoiced in the local currency or us dollars using
current exchange rates

     cadence expects that revenue from its international operations will
continue to account for a significant portion of its total revenue

     exposure to foreign currency transaction risk can arise when transactions
are conducted in a currency different from the functional currency of a cadence
subsidiary cadence uses foreign currency forward exchange contracts and
purchases foreign currency put options to help protect against currency exchange
risks although cadence attempts to reduce the impact of foreign currency
fluctuations significant exchange rate movements may hurt cadences results of
operations as expressed in us dollars exchange rate gains and losses on the
translation into us dollars of amounts denominated in foreign currencies are
included as a separate component of stockholders equity and reflected losses of
47 million in 2000 25 million in 1999 and 14 million in 1998

     on january 1 1999 11 member countries of the european union adopted the
euro as their common legal currency and established fixed conversion rates
between their sovereign currencies and the euro transactions can be made in
either the sovereign currencies or the euro until january 1 2002 when the euro
must be used exclusively currently only electronic transactions may be
conducted using the euro cadence is in the process of upgrading its internal
systems and believes that its financial institution vendors are capable of
handling the

euro conversion and cadence is in the process of examining current marketing and
pricing policies and strategies that may be affected by conversion to the euro
the cost of this effort is not expected to materially harm cadences results of
operations or financial condition however cadence cannot assure you that all
issues related to the euro conversion have been identified and that any
additional issues would not materially harm cadences results of operations or
financial condition for example the conversion to the euro may have
competitive implications on cadences pricing and marketing strategies and
cadence may be at risk to the extent its principal european suppliers and
customers are unable to deal effectively with the impact of the euro conversion
cadence has not yet completed its evaluation of the impact of the euro
conversion on its functional currency designations

     cadences international operations may also be subject to other risks
including

      the adoption and expansion of government trade restrictions

      limitations on repatriation of earnings

      reduced protection of intellectual property rights in some countries

      recessions in foreign economies

      longer receivables collection periods and greater difficulty in
       collecting accounts receivable

      difficulties in managing foreign operations

      political and economic instability

      unexpected changes in regulatory requirements

      tariffs and other trade barriers and

      us government licensing requirements for export as licenses can be
       difficult to obtain

research and development

     cadences investment in research and development was 2924 million in
2000 2449 million in 1999 and 2245 million in 1998 prior to capitalizing
software development costs of 284 million 257 million and 217 million
respectively see notes to consolidated financial statements for a more
complete description of cadences capitalization of certain software development
costs

     the primary areas of research include soc design the design of silicon
devices in the deep submicron range highspeed board design
architecturallevel design highperformance logic verification technology and
hardwaresoftware codesign the industries in which cadence competes experience
rapid technology developments changes in industry standards changes in
customer requirements and frequent new product introductions and improvements
if cadence is unable to respond quickly and successfully to these developments
and changes cadence may lose its competitive position and its products or
technologies may become noncompetitive or obsolete in which case revenues
would be materially and adversely affected in order to compete successfully
cadence must develop or acquire new products and improve its existing products
and processes on a schedule that keeps pace with technological developments in
its industries cadence must also be able to support a range of changing
computer software hardware platforms and customer preferences there is no
guarantee that cadence will be successful in this respect

     cadences advanced research and development group cadence laboratories is
committed to new technological development this group is chartered with
identifying and developing prototype technologies in emerging design areas that
will offer substantially improved alternatives to current eda solutions

competition

     the electronic design automation product market and the commercial
electronic design and methodology services industries are highly competitive if
cadence is unable to compete successfully in these industries it could
seriously harm cadences business operating results and financial condition
to compete in these

                                        10
page   11

industries cadence must identify and develop innovative and costcompetitive
eda products and market them in a timely manner it must also gain industry
acceptance for its design and methodology services and offer better strategic
concepts technical solutions prices and response time or a combination of
these benefits than those of other design companies and the internal design
departments of electronics manufacturers cadence cannot assure you that it will
be able to compete successfully in these industries factors that could affect
cadences ability to succeed include

      the development of competitive eda products and design and methodology
       services could result in a shift of customer preferences away from
       cadences products and services and significantly decrease revenue

      the electronics design and methodology services industries are relatively
       new and electronics design companies and manufacturers are only beginning
       to purchase these services from outside vendors

      the pace of technology change demands continuous technological
       development to meet the requirements of nextgeneration design
       challenges and

      there are a significant number of current and potential competitors in
       the eda industry and the cost of entry is low

     in the eda products industry cadence currently competes with three large
companies avant corporation mentor graphics corporation and synopsys inc
and numerous smaller companies cadence also competes with manufacturers of
electronic devices that have developed or have the capability to internally
develop their own eda products in the electronics design and methodology
services industries cadence competes with numerous electronic design and
consulting companies as well as with the internal design capabilities of
electronics manufacturers many manufacturers of electronic devices may be
reluctant to purchase services from independent vendors such as cadence because
they wish to promote their own internal design departments electronics
companies and management consulting firms continue to enter the electronics
design and methodology services industries

proprietary technology

     cadences success depends in part upon its proprietary technology many
cadence products include software or other intellectual property licensed from
third parties cadence generally relies on patents copyrights trademarks and
trade secret laws to establish and protect its proprietary rights in technology
and products despite precautions cadence may take to protect its intellectual
property cadence cannot assure you that third parties will not try to
challenge invalidate or circumvent these patents cadence also cannot assure
you that the rights granted under its patents will provide it with any
competitive advantages patents will be issued on any of its pending
applications or future patents will be sufficiently broad to protect cadences
technology furthermore the laws of foreign countries may not protect cadences
proprietary rights in those countries to the same extent as us law protects
these rights in the us cadence may have to seek new or renew existing licenses
for this software and other intellectual property in the future the cadence
design services business also requires it to license the software or other
intellectual property of third parties cadences failure to obtain for its use
software or other intellectual property licenses or other intellectual property
rights on favorable terms or the need to engage in litigation over these
licenses or rights could seriously harm cadences business operating results
and financial condition

     cadence cannot assure you that its reliance on licenses from or to third
parties or patent copyright trademark and trade secret protection will be
enough to be successful and profitable in the industries in which cadence
competes there are numerous patents in the eda industry and new patents are
being issued at a rapid rate it is not always economically practicable to
determine in advance whether a product or any of its components infringes the
patent rights of others as a result cadence may be forced to respond to or
prosecute intellectual property infringement claims to protect its rights or
defend a customers rights these claims regardless of merit could consume
valuable management time result in costly litigation or cause product shipment
delays all of which could seriously harm cadences business operating results
and financial condition in settling these claims cadence may be required to
enter into royalty or licensing agreements with

                                        11
page   12

the third parties claiming infringement these royalty or licensing agreements
if available may not have terms acceptable to cadence being forced to enter
into a license agreement with unfavorable terms could seriously harm cadences
business operating results and financial condition

manufacturing

     cadence software production operations consist of configuring the proper
version of a product outsourcing the recording of the product on magnetic tape
or cdrom and producing customerunique access keys allowing customers to use
licensed products user manuals and other documentation are generally available
on cdrom but are occasionally supplied in hard copy format software and
documentation are also made available to selected customers by electronic
distribution over the internet

     cadence performs final assembly and test of its emulation products in san
jose california subcontractors manufacture all major subassemblies including
all individual printed circuit boards and custom integrated circuits and supply
them to cadence for qualification and testing prior to their incorporation into
the assembled product

     cadence has generally been able to obtain adequate manufacturing supplies
in a timely manner from existing sources or where necessary from alternative
sources of supply however a reduction or interruption in supply or a
significant increase in the price of one or more components would adversely
affect cadences business operating results and financial condition and could
damage customer relationships

employees

     as of february 28 2001 cadence employed approximately 5650 persons with
approximately 3250 in sales services marketing support and manufacturing
activities 1600 in product development and 800 in management administration
and finance none of cadences employees is represented by a labor union and
cadence has experienced no work stoppages cadence believes that its employee
relations are good

factors that may affect future results

     the following risk factors and other information included in this annual
report on form 10k should be carefully considered the risks and uncertainties
described below are not the only ones cadence faces additional risks and
uncertainties not currently known to cadence or that cadence currently deems
immaterial also may impair cadences business operations if any of the
following risks actually occurs cadences business operating results and
financial condition could be materially harmed the risk factors affecting
tality corporation which is and immediately after its initial public offering
will remain a subsidiary of cadence are described in detail in the
registration statement on form s1 filed by tality corporation with the
securities and exchange commission on july 17 2000 as amended unless
specifically noted references to cadence in the discussion below are references
to cadence and its subsidiaries including tality corporation and its
subsidiaries

cadence is subject to the cyclical nature of the integrated circuit industry and
the electronics systems industry
     and the current downturn or any future downturns may reduce our revenue

     purchases of our products and services are highly dependent upon the
commencement of new design projects by integrated circuit manufacturers and
electronics systems companies the integrated circuit industry is highly
cyclical and is characterized by constant and rapid technological change rapid
product obsolescence and price erosion evolving standards short product life
cycles and wide fluctuations in product supply and demand the integrated
circuit and electronics systems industries have experienced significant
downturns often connected with or in anticipation of maturing product cycles
of both these companies and their customers products and a decline in general
economic conditions these downturns have been characterized by diminished
product demand production over capacity high inventory levels and accelerated
erosion of average selling prices during these downturns the number of new
design projects may decrease certain integrated circuit manufacturers and
electronics systems companies have recently announced a

                                        12
page   13

slowdown of demand and production the current slowdown and any future downturns
may reduce our revenue and harm our results of operations

cadence has reorganized its design services group as a separate company which
may impact its financial
     results

     since 1995 cadence has operated an internal electronics design services
group on july 17 2000 cadence announced its plan to separate its design
services group into a separate company focused on providing design solutions and
proprietary technology to electronics product companies and integrated circuit
manufacturers and announced the planned initial public offering of the separate
company the separation was substantially completed on october 4 2000 on
october 9 2000 cadence announced that it had postponed talitys initial public
offering due to unfavorable market conditions upon completion of the planned
initial public offering of tality cadence expects that it will hold
approximately 80 of the voting power of tality while cadence does not
currently plan to distribute to cadence stockholders its equity interests in
tality corporation or talitys subsidiaries it will have the right at any time
to sell some or all of these equity interests cadence has agreed with the
underwriters not to transfer its equity interests in tality corporation and
limited partnership units in tality lp for 180 days after the date of the
initial public offering of tality corporation except with the prior written
consent of goldman sachs  co after the expiration of this 180day period
cadence will no longer be restricted from transferring any of its common stock
of tality corporation or limited partnership units in tality lp to the public
or its stockholders cadence currently expects that the principal factors that
it would consider in determining whether and when to exchange convert sell or
distribute to its stockholders any of its shares or partnership units include

      the relative market prices of talitys common stock and cadences common
       stock

      the ability of an affiliate of tality to make sales under rule 144 of the
       securities act of 1933 or under an effective registration statement
       covering cadences shares of talitys common stock

      the absence of any court order or other regulation prohibiting or
       restricting such sales and

      other conditions affecting talitys business or cadences other
       businesses

cadence has agreed to grant certain rights and provide certain services to
tality on terms that are more
     favorable to tality than terms that would be offered to an unrelated party

     in connection with the separation of tality cadence entered into a number
of agreements governing its business relationships with tality and cadences
provision of certain services to tality including provision of certain
facilities and accounting finance legal human resources and other
administrative services on terms that are more favorable to tality than terms
that would be offered to an unrelated entity as a result cadence is obligated
to provide certain services to tality for the periods defined in the various
agreements some of which have long or unspecified terms which may impact our
financial results

cadence has historically suffered losses in its electronics design and
methodology services business

     the market for electronics design and methodology services is relatively
new and rapidly evolving cadences expenses of the design services business
increased substantially in connection with the completion of talitys separation
from cadence and its expenses may continue to increase as it seeks to expand its
business the rate of growth of talitys revenue over prior periods may not
continue or increase at all and its separation and expansion may prove more
expensive than cadence anticipates if tality fails to increase its revenue to
offset its expenses tality will continue to experience losses cadences or
talitys failure to succeed in these services businesses may seriously harm
cadences business operating results and financial condition

                                        13

the success of cadences electronic design and methodology services businesses
     depend on many factors that are beyond its control

     in order to be successful with its electronics design and methodology
services cadence must overcome several factors that are beyond its control
including the following

      cadences cost of services personnel is high and reduces gross
       margin gross margin represents the difference between the amount of
       revenue from the sale of services and cadences cost of providing those
       services cadence must pay high salaries to attract and retain
       professional services personnel this results in a lower gross margin
       than the gross margin in cadences software business in addition the
       high cost of training new services personnel or not fully utilizing these
       personnel can significantly lower gross margin

      a substantial portion of these services contracts are fixedprice
       contracts this means that the customer pays a fixed price that has been
       agreed upon ahead of time no matter how much time or how many resources
       cadence must devote to perform the contract if cadences cost in
       performing the services consistently and significantly exceeds the amount
       the customer has agreed to pay it could seriously harm cadences
       business operating results and financial condition

cadences failure to respond quickly to technological developments could make
     its products uncompetitive and obsolete

     the industries in which cadence competes experience rapid technology
developments changes in industry standards changes in customer requirements
and frequent new product introductions and improvements currently the
electronic chip design industry is experiencing several revolutionary trends

      the size of features such as wires transistors and contacts on chips is
       shrinking due to advances in semiconductor manufacturing processes
       process feature sizes refer to the width of the transistors and the width
       and spacing of the interconnect on the chip feature size is normally
       identified by the headline transistor length which is shrinking from
       035 microns to 018 microns and smaller this is commonly referred to in
       the semiconductor industry as the migration to deep submicron and it
       represents a major challenge for all levels of the semiconductor industry
       from chip design and design automation to design of manufacturing
       equipment and the manufacturing process itself shrinkage of transistor
       length to such infinitesimal proportions for reference the diameter of
       the period at the end of this sentence is approximately 400 microns is
       challenging fundamental laws of physics and chemistry

      the ability to design very large chips in particular integration of
       entire electronic systems onto a single chip instead of a circuit board
       a process that is referred to in the industry as soc increases the
       complexity of managing a design that at the lowest level is represented
       by billions of shapes on the fabrication mask in addition systems
       typically incorporate microprocessors and digital signal processors that
       are programmed with software requiring simultaneous design of the
       silicon chip and the related embedded software on the chip

     if cadence is unable to respond quickly and successfully to these
developments and changes cadence may lose its competitive position and its
products or technologies may become uncompetitive or obsolete in order to
compete successfully cadence must develop or acquire new products and improve
its existing products and processes on a schedule that keeps pace with
technological developments in its industries cadence must also be able to
support a range of changing computer software hardware platforms and customer
preferences there is no guarantee that cadence will be successful in this
regard

cadences failure to obtain software or other intellectual property licenses or
     adequately protect its proprietary rights could seriously harm its business

     cadences success depends in part upon its proprietary technology many
of cadences products include software or other intellectual property licensed
from third parties and cadence may have to seek new or renew existing licenses
for this software and other intellectual property in the future cadences
design services

                                        14
page   15

     business also requires it to license software or other intellectual
property of third parties cadences failure to obtain for its use software or
other intellectual property licenses or other intellectual property rights on
favorable terms or the need to engage in litigation over these licenses or
rights could seriously harm cadences business operating results and
financial condition

     also cadence generally relies on patents copyrights trademarks and trade
secret laws to establish and protect its proprietary rights in technology and
products despite precautions cadence may take to protect its intellectual
property cadence cannot assure you that third parties will not try to
challenge invalidate or circumvent these patents cadence also cannot assure
you that the rights granted under its patents will provide it with any
competitive advantages patents will be issued on any of its pending
applications or future patents will be sufficiently broad to protect cadences
technology furthermore the laws of foreign countries may not protect cadences
proprietary rights in those countries to the same extent as us law protects
these rights in the us

     cadence cannot assure you that its reliance on licenses from or to third
parties or that patent copyright trademark and trade secret protections
will be enough to be successful and profitable in the industries in which
cadence competes

intellectual property infringement by or against cadence could seriously harm
its business

     there are numerous patents in the eda industry and new patents are being
issued at a rapid rate it is not always economically practicable to determine
in advance whether a product or any of its components infringes the patent
rights of others as a result from time to time cadence may be forced to
respond to or prosecute intellectual property infringement claims to protect its
rights or defend a customers rights these claims regardless of merit could
consume valuable management time result in costly litigation or cause product
shipment delays all of which could seriously harm cadences business operating
results and financial condition in settling these claims cadence may be
required to enter into royalty or licensing agreements with the third parties
claiming infringement these royalty or licensing agreements if available may
not have terms acceptable to cadence being forced to enter into a license
agreement with unfavorable terms could seriously harm cadences business
operating results and financial condition any potential intellectual property
litigation could force us to do one or more of the following

      pay damages to the party claiming infringement

      stop licensing or providing services that use the challenged
       intellectual property

      obtain a license from the owner of the infringed intellectual property to
       sell or use the relevant technology which license may not be available
       on reasonable terms or at all or

      redesign the challenged technology which could be timeconsuming and
       costly

     if we were forced to take any of these actions our business and results of
operations may be harmed

cadence obtains key components for its hardware products from a limited number
of suppliers

     cadence depends on several suppliers for certain key components and board
assemblies used in its hardwarebased verification products cadences inability
to develop alternative sources or to obtain sufficient quantities of these
components or board assemblies could result in delays or reductions in product
shipments in particular cadence currently relies on taiwan semiconductor
manufacturing corporation for the supply of key integrated circuits and on ibm
for the hardware components for both cadences cobalttm product and
mercuryplustm other disruptions in supply may also occur if there were such
a reduction or interruption cadences results of operations would be seriously
harmed even if cadence can eventually obtain these components from alternative
sources a significant delay in cadences ability to deliver products would
result

                                        15
page   16

fluctuations in quarterly results of operations could hurt cadences business
and the market price of its stock

     cadence has experienced and may continue to experience varied quarterly
operating results various factors affect cadences quarterly operating results
and some of them are not within cadences control including the mix of products
and services sold the mix of licenses used to sell products and the timing of
significant orders for its software products and services by customers
quarterly operating results are affected by the mix of products and services
sold because there are significant differences in margins from the sale of
hardware and software products and services for example based on a threeyear
average in 1999 cadence had realized gross margins on software product sales of
approximately 87 but realized gross margins of approximately 64 on hardware
product sales and 30 on its performance of services in 2000 realized gross
margins decreased to approximately 78 for software products remained flat at
64 for hardware products and increased to approximately 31 for services in
addition cadences quarterly operating results are affected by the mix of
licenses entered into in connection with the sale of software products cadence
has three basic licensing models perpetual fixedterm and subscription
perpetual and fixedterm licenses recognize a larger portion of the revenue at
the beginning of the license period and subscription licenses recognize revenue
ratably over each quarter of the term of the license as cadence customers
purchase more software products pursuant to subscription agreements future
operating results may be lower than that of comparable quarters in which
perpetual and fixedterm licenses were in greater use for software product
transactions finally cadences quarterly operating results are affected by the
timing of significant orders for its software products because a significant
number of contracts for software products are in excess of 5 million the
failure to close a contract for the sale of one or more orders of cadences
software products could seriously harm its quarterly operating results

     sales of cadences hardware products depend in significant part upon the
decision of the prospective customer to commence a project for the design and
development of complex computer chips and systems these projects often require
significant commitments of time and capital cadences hardware sales may be
delayed if customers delay commencement of projects lengthy hardware sales
cycles subject cadence to a number of significant risks over which cadence has
little or no control including insufficient excess or obsolescent inventory
variations in inventory valuation and fluctuations in quarterly operating
results

     in addition cadence bases its expense budgets partially on its
expectations of future revenue however it is difficult to predict revenue
levels or growth revenue levels that are below cadences expectations could
seriously hurt cadences business operating results and financial condition
if revenue or operating results fall short of the levels expected by public
market analysts and investors the trading price of cadence common stock could
decline dramatically also because of the timing of large orders and its
customers buying patterns cadence may not learn of revenue shortfalls
earnings shortfalls or other failures to meet market expectations until late in
a fiscal quarter which could cause even more immediate and serious harm to the
trading price of cadence common stock

     cadence believes that quartertoquarter comparisons of the results of
operations of its services business segments may not be meaningful therefore
stockholders should not view cadences historical results of operations as
reliable indicators of its future performance in addition many of our services
engagements are terminable with little or no advance notice and without penalty
since a significant portion of our costs is fixed we may not be able to reduce
our costs in a timely manner in connection with the unanticipated revenue loss
when one or more projects is terminated

the lengthy sales cycle of cadences products and services makes the timing of
     its revenue difficult to predict and may cause its operating results to
     fluctuate unexpectedly

     cadence has a lengthy sales cycle that generally extends at least three to
six months the length of our sales cycle may cause our revenue and operating
results to vary unexpectedly from quarter to quarter the complexity and expense
associated with our business generally requires a lengthy customer education and
approval process consequently we may incur substantial expenses and devote
significant management effort and expense to develop potential relationships
that do not result in agreements or revenue and may prevent us from pursuing
other opportunities

                                        16
page   17

     in addition sales of our products and services may be delayed if customers
delay approval or commencement of projects because of

      customers budgetary constraints and internal acceptance review
       procedures

      the timing of customers budget cycles and

      the timing of customers competitive evaluation processes

     if customers experience delays in their approval or project commencement
activities we may not learn of and therefore be able to communicate to the
public revenue or earnings shortfalls until late in a fiscal quarter

cadence expects to acquire other companies and may not successfully integrate
     them or the companies it has recently acquired

     cadence has acquired other businesses before and is likely to do so again
while cadence expects to analyze carefully all potential transactions before
committing to them cadence cannot assure you that any transaction that is
completed will result in longterm benefits to cadence or its stockholders or
that cadences management will be able to manage the acquired businesses
effectively in addition growth through acquisition involves a number of risks
if any of the following events occurs after cadence acquires another business
it could seriously harm cadences business operating results and financial
condition

      difficulties in combining previously separate businesses into a single
       unit

      the substantial diversion of managements attention from daytoday
       business when negotiating these transactions and then integrating an
       acquired business

      the discovery after the acquisition has been completed of liabilities
       assumed from the acquired business

      the failure to realize anticipated benefits such as cost savings and
       revenue enhancements

      the failure to retain key personnel of the acquired business

      difficulties related to assimilating the products of an acquired business
       in for example distribution engineering and customer support areas

      unanticipated costs

      adverse effects on existing relationships with suppliers and customers
       and

      failure to understand and compete effectively in markets in which we have
       limited previous experience

cadences international operations may seriously harm its financial condition
     because of several weak foreign economies and the effect of foreign
     exchange rate fluctuations

     cadence has significant operations outside the united states cadences
revenue from international operations as a percentage of total revenue was
approximately 44 for fiscal 2000 and 52 for fiscal 1999 cadence also
transacts business in various foreign currencies recent economic uncertainty
and the volatility of foreign currencies in certain parts of the asiapacific
region has had and may continue to have a seriously harmful effect on
cadences revenue and operating results

     fluctuations in the rate of exchange between the us dollar and the
currencies of countries other than the us in which cadence conducts business
could seriously harm its business operating results and financial condition
for example if there is an increase in the rate at which a foreign currency
exchanges into us dollars it will take more of the foreign currency to equal
a specified amount of us dollars than before the rate increase if cadence
prices its products and services in the foreign currency it will receive less
in us dollars than it did before the rate increase went into effect if
cadence prices its products and services in us dollars an increase in the
exchange rate will result in an increase in the price for cadences products and
services compared to those products of its competitors that are priced in local
currency this could result in

                                        17
page   18

cadences prices being uncompetitive in markets where business is transacted in
the local currency cadences international operations may also be subject to
other risks including

      the adoption and expansion of government trade restrictions

      volatile foreign exchange rates and currency conversion risks

      limitations on repatriation of earnings

      reduced protection of intellectual property rights in some countries

      recessions in foreign economies

      longer receivables collection periods and greater difficulty in
       collecting accounts receivable

      difficulties in managing foreign operations

      political and economic instability

      unexpected changes in regulatory requirements

      tariffs and other trade barriers and

      us government licensing requirements for export which make licenses
       difficult to obtain

     cadence expects that revenue from its international operations will
continue to account for a significant portion of its total revenue

     exposure to foreign currency transaction risk can arise when transactions
are conducted in a currency different from the functional currency of a cadence
subsidiary a subsidiarys functional currency is the currency in which it
primarily conducts its operations including product pricing expenses and
borrowings cadence uses foreign currency forward exchange contracts and
purchases foreign currency put options to help protect against currency exchange
risks these forward contracts and put options allow cadence to buy or sell
specific foreign currencies at specific prices on specific dates increases or
decreases in the value of cadences foreign currency transactions are partially
offset by gains and losses on these forward contracts and put options although
cadence attempts to reduce the impact of foreign currency fluctuations
significant exchange rate movements may hurt cadences results of operations as
expressed in us dollars

     foreign currency exchange risk occurs for some of cadences foreign
operations whose functional currency is the local currency the primary effect
of foreign currency translation on cadences results of operations is a
reduction in revenue from a strengthening us dollar offset by a smaller
reduction in expenses exchange rate gains and losses on the translation into
us dollars of amounts denominated in foreign currencies are included as a
separate component of stockholders equity

failure to obtain export licenses could harm cadences business

     cadence must comply with us department of commerce regulations in
shipping its software products and other technologies outside the us although
cadence has not had any significant difficulty complying with these regulations
so far any significant future difficulty in complying could harm cadences
business operating results and financial condition

cadences inability to compete in its industries could seriously harm its
business

     the eda market and the commercial electronics design and methodology
services industries are highly competitive if cadence is unable to compete
successfully in these industries it could seriously harm cadences business
operating results and financial condition to compete in these industries
cadence must identify and develop innovative and cost competitive electronic
design automation software products and market them in a timely manner it must
also gain industry acceptance for its design and methodology services and offer
better strategic concepts technical solutions prices and response time or a
combination of these factors than those of other design companies and the
internal design departments of electronics manufactur

                                        18

ers cadence cannot assure you that it will be able to compete successfully in
these industries factors that could affect cadences ability to succeed
include

      the development of competitive eda products and design and methodology
       services could result in a shift of customer preferences away from
       cadences products and services and significantly decrease revenue

      the electronics design and methodology services industries are relatively
       new and electronics design companies and manufacturers are only beginning
       to purchase these services from outside vendors

      the pace of the technology change demands continuous technological
       development to meet the requirements of nextgeneration design
       challenges and

      there are a significant number of current and potential competitors in
       the eda industry and the cost of entry is low

     in the eda products industry cadence currently competes with three large
companies avant corporation mentor graphics corporation and synopsys inc
and numerous smaller companies cadence also competes with manufacturers of
electronic devices that have developed or have the capability to develop their
own eda products many manufacturers of electronic devices may be reluctant to
purchase services from independent vendors such as cadence because they wish to
promote their own internal design departments in the electronics design and
methodology services industries cadence competes with numerous electronic
design and consulting companies as well as with the internal design capabilities
of electronics manufacturers other electronics companies and management
consulting firms continue to enter the electronic design and methodology
services industries

cadences failure to attract train motivate and retain key employees may harm
its business

     competition for highly skilled employees is very intense cadences
business depends on the efforts and abilities of its senior management its
research and development staff and a number of other key management sales
support technical and services personnel the high cost of training new
personnel not fully utilizing these personnel or losing trained personnel to
competing employers could reduce our gross margins and harm our business and
operating results competition for these personnel is intense particularly in
geographic areas recognized as high technology centers such as the silicon
valley area where our principal offices are located and the other locations
where we maintain large facilities to attract and retain individuals with the
requisite expertise we may be required to grant large numbers of stock options
or other stockbased incentive awards which may be dilutive to existing
stockholders we may also be required to pay significant base salaries and cash
bonuses which could harm our operating results if we do not succeed in hiring
and retaining candidates with appropriate qualifications we will not be able to
grow our business and our operating results will suffer cadences failure to
attract train motivate and retain key employees would impair its development
of new products its ability to provide design and methodology services and the
management of its businesses this would seriously harm cadences business
operating results and financial condition

if cadence become subject to unfair hiring claims cadence could be prevented
     from hiring needed personnel incur liability for damages and incur
     substantial costs in defending itself

     companies in cadences industry whose employees accept positions with
competitors frequently claim that these competitors have engaged in unfair
hiring practices or that the employment of these persons would involve the
disclosure or use of trade secrets these claims could prevent us from hiring
personnel or cause us to incur liability for damages cadence could also incur
substantial costs in defending ourselves or its employees against these claims
regardless of their merits defending ourselves from these claims could also
divert the attention of cadences management away from its operations

errors or defects in cadence designs could expose it to liability and harm our
reputation

     cadences customers use its products and services in designing and
developing products that involve a high degree of technological complexity each
of which has its own specifications and is based on various

                                        19
page   20

industry standards because of the complexity of the systems and products with
which cadence works some of its products and designs can be adequately tested
only when put to full use in the marketplace as a result its customers or
their end users may discover errors or defects in cadences software or the
systems cadence designs or the products or systems incorporating its design and
intellectual property may not operate as expected errors or defects could
result in

      loss of current customers and loss of or delay in revenue and loss of
       market share

      failure to attract new customers or achieve market acceptance

      diversion of development resources to resolving the problem

      increased service costs and

      liability for damages

we rely on a continuous power supply to conduct our operations and californias
     current energy crisis could disrupt our operations and increase our
     expenses

     california is in the midst of an energy crisis that could disrupt our
operations and increase our expenses in the event of an acute power shortage
that is when power reserves for the state of california fall below 15
california has on some occasions implemented and may in the future continue to
implement rolling blackouts throughout california we currently have backup
generators or alternate sources of power for critical operations in the event of
a blackout if blackouts interrupt our power supply however we may be
temporarily unable to continue operations at our facilities any such
interruption in our ability to continue operations at our facilities could
damage our reputation harm our ability to retain existing customers and to
obtain new customers and could result in lost revenue any of which could
substantially harm our business and results of operations our current insurance
does not provide coverage for any damages we or our customers may suffer as a
result of any interruption in our power supply

antitakeover defenses in cadences charter bylaws and under delaware law
     could prevent an acquisition of cadence or limit the price that investors
     might be willing to pay for cadence common stock

     provisions of the delaware general corporation law that apply to cadence
and its certificate of incorporation could make it difficult for another company
to acquire control of cadence for example

      section 203 of the delaware general corporation law generally prohibits a
       delaware corporation from engaging in any business combination with a
       person owning 15 or more of its voting stock or who is affiliated with
       the corporation and owned 15 or more of its voting stock at any time
       within three years prior to the proposed business combination for a
       period of three years from the date the person became a 15 owner unless
       specified conditions are met

      cadences certificate of incorporation allows cadences board of
       directors to issue at any time and without stockholder approval
       preferred stock with such terms as it may determine no shares of
       preferred stock are currently outstanding however the rights of holders
       of any cadence preferred stock that may be issued in the future may be
       superior to the rights of holders of its common stock

      cadence has a rights plan commonly known as a poison pill which would
       make it difficult for someone to acquire cadence without the approval of
       cadences board of directors

     all or any one of these factors could limit the price that certain
investors would be willing to pay for shares of cadence common stock and could
delay prevent or allow cadences board of directors to resist an acquisition of
cadence even if the proposed transaction was favored by a majority of cadences
independent stockholders

item 2 properties

     cadences headquarters are located in san jose california and cadence
owns the related land and buildings additionally cadence owns buildings in
india and land and buildings in scotland the total square footage of cadences
owned buildings is approximately 984000 square feet

     cadence leases additional facilities for its sales offices in the us and
various foreign countries and its research and development and design services
facilities in california and other states and in foreign countries including
scotland india canada england and japan

     cadence believes that these facilities and the undeveloped land it owns
adjacent to its current headquarters are adequate for its current needs and that
suitable additional or substitute space will be available as needed to
accommodate any expansion of cadences operations



item 3 legal proceedings

     from time to time cadence is involved in various disputes and litigation
matters that arise in the ordinary course of business these include disputes
and lawsuits related to intellectual property mergers and acquisitions

district of california on december 6 1995 against avant corporation and
certain of its employees for misappropriation of trade secrets copyright

joseph b costello cadences former president and chief executive officer and
with leave of the court on january 29 1998 filed a second amended
counterclaim the second amended counterclaim alleges inter alia that cadence
and mr costello had cooperated with the santa clara county california
district attorney and initiated and pursued its complaint against avant for
anticompetitive reasons engaged in wrongful activity in an attempt to
manipulate avants stock price and utilized certain pricing policies and other
acts to unfairly compete against avant in the marketplace the second amended
counterclaim also alleges that certain cadence insiders engaged in illegal
insider trading with respect to avants stock cadence and mr costello believe
that they have meritorious defenses to avants claims and each intends to
defend such action vigorously by an order dated july 13 1996 the court
bifurcated avants counterclaim from cadences complaint and stayed the
counterclaim pending resolution of cadences complaint the counterclaim remains
stayed

     in an order issued on december 19 1997 as modified on january 26 1998

injunction

     by an order dated july 22 1997 the district court stayed most activity in
the case pending in that court and ordered avant to post a 5 million bond in
light of related criminal proceedings pending against avant and several of its
executives

summary adjudication and granted in part and denied in part each partys
motion regarding the scope of a june 6 1994 release agreement between the
parties the court held that cadences copyright infringement claim against
avant is not barred by the release and that cadence may proceed on that claim
the court also held that cadences trade secret claim based on avants use of
cadences design framework ii source code is barred by the release the ninth
circuit has agreed to hear both parties appeal from the district courts order
the trial date has been vacated pending a decision on the appeal and the outcome
of the criminal case for which the trial is scheduled to begin in april 2001

     product revenue increased 122 million in 2000 when compared to 1999
primarily due to an overall increase in price and volume of license renewals
with major customers the increases in sales volume of products was primarily
attributable to increased sales of intellectual property creation products
which include mixed signal and simulation products integrated circuit
implementation products which include place and route physical design and
physical verification products and printed circuit board related products

     product revenue decreased 2551 million in 1999 when compared to 1998
primarily due to the implementation of cadences new software subscription
licensing model during the third quarter of 1999 and

                                        29
page   30

to a lesser extent a decrease in sales volume of cadences software products
these decreases were partially offset by an increase in emulation hardware
product revenue in the same periods and the favorable impact of foreign currency
exchange rate differences primarily the japanese yen revenue associated with
software products under subscription licenses is recognized ratably over the
license period because the agreements allow customers to exchange licensed
products for unspecified future technology

     services revenue increased 411 million in 2000 when compared to 1999
primarily due to an increase in tality revenue of 695 million partially
offset by a decrease of 284 million in methodology services revenue talitys
revenue increase is primarily due to increases in the total size of active
client engagements and total client service hours billed the decrease in
methodology services engagements is primarily due to lower staffing levels
services revenue increased 297 million in 1999 when compared to 1998
primarily due to an increase in tality revenue of 236 million talitys
increase is primarily due to an increase in the total size of active client
engagements and an increase in total client service hours billed

     maintenance revenue increased 232 million in 2000 when compared to 1999
primarily due to the growth of the installed customer base maintenance revenue
was relatively flat in 1999 compared to 1998

     international revenue decreased 77 million in 2000 when compared to 1999
primarily due to decreases in product revenue in japan and services revenue in
europe and japan partially offset by an increase in product and maintenance
revenue in europe

     international revenue decreased 771 million in 1999 when compared to
1998 primarily due to decreases in product revenue in all international regions
resulting from the implementation of cadences new subscription licensing model
during the third quarter of 1999 the decrease in international product revenue
was partially offset by an increase in services revenue in all international
regions except asia

     other differences in the rate of revenue growth over the years presented
and as compared geographically are primarily due to fluctuations in sales volume
of place and route and physical design products and for cadences design and
methodology services offerings

     foreign currency exchange rates negatively affected reported revenue by
38 million in 2000 primarily due to the weakening of the british pound and
german mark in relation to the us dollar partially offset by the
strengthening of the japanese yen in relation to the us dollar foreign
currency exchange rates positively affected reported revenue by 162 million in
1999 primarily due to the strengthening of the japanese yen in relation to the
us dollar additional information about revenue by geographic areas can be
found under segment reporting in the notes to consolidated financial

     cost of product revenue includes costs of production personnel packaging
and documentation royalties and amortization of capitalized software
development costs for software products manufacturing costs associated with
hardware emulation system products include materials labor and overhead

     cost of product revenue increased 104 million or 13 in 2000 when
compared to 1999 the increase was primarily due to increases in manufacturing
expenses associated with emulation system products and amortization of
capitalized software development costs cost of product revenue increased 2
million or 3 in 1999 when compared to 1998 the increase was primarily due to
increases in manufacturing expenses associated with emulation system products
the acquisition of orcad in 1999 and amortization of capitalized software
development costs these costs were offset partially by inventory obsolescence
charges of 57 million associated with the introduction of the mercury design
verification system recorded in 1998 reductions in purchased software
amortization and thirdparty royalty expenses

     because the majority of cadences cost of software product revenue does not
vary significantly with changes in revenue product gross margin increased in
2000 when compared to 1999 due primarily to increased sales of software
products and the introduction of the new subscription licensing model during the
third quarter of 1999

     cost of services revenue includes costs associated with providing services
to customers primarily salaries and benefits costs to recruit develop and
retain personnel cost of software depreciation facilities and project
management and costs to maintain the infrastructure necessary to manage a
services organization cost of services revenue increased 238 million or 12
in 2000 when compared to 1999 primarily due to an increase in the number of
design engineers cost of services revenue increased 3 million or 2 in 1999
when compared to 1998 primarily due to increases in amortization of purchased
software and distributor commission costs for methodology services in japan
offset partially by a decrease in employee related costs including incentive
pay associated primarily with cadences 1998 restructuring and lower revenues

     services gross margins remained relatively flat in 2000 as compared to
1999 the increase in services gross margins to 35 in 1999 as compared to 29
in 1998 was primarily due to increased utilization of services capacity and the
management of expenses services gross margins have been and may continue to be
adversely affected by the cost of integrating new services professionals as well
as cadences inability to fully utilize these resources in addition services
gross margins may continue to be adversely affected by cadences inability to
achieve operating efficiencies with its resources when implementing a growing
number of service offerings

     cost of maintenance revenue includes the cost of customer services such as
hotline and onsite support production personnel packaging and documentation
of maintenance updates cost of maintenance revenue increased 97 million or
18 in 2000 when compared to 1999 primarily due to costs associated with the
orcad acquisition which was completed in the third quarter of 1999 for which
there were no similar costs in the first seven months of 1999 and increases in
employeerelated costs and costs to invest in customer service

decrease in amortization related to the 133 million asset impairment charge of
exd in the fourth quarter of 1999 amortization of acquired intangibles
increased 433 million in 1999 when compared to 1998 primarily due to the

marketing and sales

     the increase in marketing and sales expenses of 359 million for 2000
when compared to 1999 was primarily due to an increase in employeerelated
costs the acquisition of orcad and marketing program costs partially offset
by lower consulting costs foreign currency exchange rates positively affected
marketing and sales expenses by 27 million in 2000 when compared to 1999
primarily due to the weakening of the german mark the french franc and the
british pound in relation to the us dollar partially offset by the
strengthening of the japanese yen in relation to the us dollar the increase
in marketing and sales expenses of 139 million for 1999 when compared to
1998 was primarily due to an increase in sales support costs the acquisition
of orcad and marketing program costs partially offset by lower
employeerelated costs resulting from cadences 1998 restructuring lower
employee training and education costs and travel costs foreign currency
exchange rates negatively affected marketing and sales expenses by 46 million
in 1999 when compared to 1998 primarily due to the strengthening of the
japanese yen in relation to the us dollar

research and development

     the increase in net research and development expenses of 447 million for
2000 when compared to 1999 was primarily attributable to higher
employeerelated costs the acquisition of orcad which was completed in the
third quarter of 1999 and for which there were no similar costs in the first
seven months of 1999 and consulting and other services the increase in net
research and development expenses of 164 million for 1999 when compared to
1998 was primarily attributable to higher employeerelated costs due to
increases in headcount from cadences acquisition of orcad in 1999 and the
acquisitions of ambit and blda in the third quarter of 1998 partially offset by
increased capitalization of software development expenses

     cadences expenses in research and development prior to the reduction for
capitalization of software development costs was 2924 million for 2000
2449 million for 1999 and 2245 million for 1998 representing 23 of total
revenue for 2000 22 for 1999 and 17 for 1998 cadence capitalized software
development costs of approximately 284 million for 2000 257 million for
1999 and 217 million for 1998 which represented approximately 10 of total
research and development expenditures for 2000 1999 and 1998 the increase in
capitalized software development costs in each of these three years resulted
primarily from general increases in new product development the amount of
capitalized software development costs in any given period may vary depending on
the exact nature of the development performed

general and administrative

     general and administrative expenses increased 77 million in 2000 when
compared to 1999 primarily due to employeerelated costs partially offset by
decreases in bad debt expense and consulting and outside services costs general
and administrative expenses remained relatively flat in 1999 when compared to
1998

separation costs

     in the year ended december 30 2000 cadence recorded 68 million in
separation costs related to the separation of its design services business and
the related planned ipo of tality cadences newly formed subsidiary these
costs primarily include legal and accounting services strategic business
planning information systems separation development of compensation and
benefits strategies and recruitment and formation of talitys senior management

inprocess technology

     in august 1999 cadence acquired orcad inc a supplier of computeraided
engineering and computeraided design software and services for the printed
circuit board industry for cash cadence acquired all of the outstanding stock
of orcad and assumed all outstanding orcad stock options the purchase price was
1314 million and the acquisition was accounted for as a purchase

     upon consummation of the orcad acquisition cadence immediately charged to
expense 118 million representing acquired inprocess technology that had not
yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use see
notes to consolidated financial statements the value assigned to acquired
inprocess technology was determined by identifying research projects in areas
for which technological feasibility has not been established the value was
determined by estimating the costs to develop the acquired inprocess technology
into commercially viable products estimating the resulting net cash flows from
such projects and discounting the net cash flows back to their present value
the discount rate included a factor that took into account the uncertainty
surrounding the successful development of the acquired inprocess technology
certain acquired inprocess technology was commercially viable in 1999 and other
acquired inprocess technology became commercially viable in 2000 expenditures
to complete this acquired inprocess technology did not exceed 23 million

     at the time of its acquisition by cadence orcads inprocess research and
development projects in the schematic entry area were related to the development
of an online component catalog and a new schematic design entry interface
inprocess research and development projects in the simulation area were related
to a rearchitecture of the simulation engine and replacement of the simulation
engine additional features under development included randomized expressions
and no selection limits the nature of the efforts to complete these projects
related in varying degrees to the completion of all planning designing
prototyping verification and testing activities that were necessary to
establish that the proposed technologies meet their design specifications
including functional technical and economic performance requirements

     the net cash flows resulting from the projects underway at orcad used to
value the purchased research and development were based on managements
estimates of revenue cost of revenue research and development costs selling
general and administrative costs and income taxes from such projects the
revenue projections were based on the potential market size that the projects
address cadences ability to gain market acceptance in these segments and the
life cycle of this inprocess technology

     estimated total revenue from the acquired inprocess technology is expected
to peak in 2001 and decline rapidly thereafter as other new products are
expected to enter the market in addition a portion of the anticipated revenue
had been attributed to enhancements of the base technology under development
and had been excluded from net cash flow calculations existing technology was
valued at 108 million the net cash flows generated from the acquired
inprocess technology were expected to reflect earnings before interest taxes
and depreciation of approximately 32 of the sales generated from inprocess
technology however there can be no assurance that these assumptions will prove
accurate or that cadence will realize the anticipated benefit of the
acquisition

     the discount of the net cash flows to their present value was based on the
weighted average cost of capital or wacc the wacc calculation produces the
average required rate of return of an investment in an operating enterprise
based on the required rates of return from investments in various areas of the
enterprise the rate used to discount the net cash flows from purchased
inprocess technology was 22 the discount rate is sometimes higher than the
wacc due to the inherent uncertainties in the estimates including the
uncertainty surrounding the successful development of the acquired inprocess
technology the useful life of such technology the profitability levels of such
technology if any and the uncertainty of technological advances all of which
were unknown at that time

     in january 1999 cadence acquired dai a supplier of design verification
technology used in soc design cadence acquired all of the outstanding stock of
dai for approximately 06 million shares of cadence common stock and 29
million of cash the total purchase price was 257 million and the acquisition
was accounted for as a purchase

     upon consummation of the dai acquisition cadence immediately charged to
expense 89 million representing acquired inprocess technology that had not
yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use see
notes to consolidated financial statements the value assigned to acquired
inprocess technology was determined by identifying research projects in areas
for which technological feasibility has not been established the value was
determined by estimating the costs to develop the acquired inprocess technology
into commercially viable products estimating the resulting net cash flows from
such projects and discounting the net cash flows back to their present value
the discount rate included a factor that took into account the uncertainty
surrounding the successful development of the acquired inprocess technology
certain acquired inprocess technology under development at the time of
acquisition was initially expected to become commercially viable in 1999 but
instead became viable in 2000 expenditures to complete this inprocess
technology did not exceed 15 million

     at the time of its acquisition by cadence dai had several significant
research and development projects in process that were intended to provide a
next generation environment for design verification and analysis these efforts
included the development of a highly automated approach for highlevel test
bench creation and analysis a waveform viewer capable of supporting analog and
mixed signal designs and a tool designed to analyze verification code coverage
at the transactional level the nature of the efforts to complete these
inprocess research and development projects related in varying degrees to the
completion of all planning designing prototyping verification and testing
activities that were necessary to establish that the proposed inprocess
technologies meet their design specifications which include functional
technical and economic performance requirements

     the net cash flows generated by the projects underway at dai used to value
the acquired inprocess technology were based on managements estimates of
revenue cost of revenue research and development costs selling general and
administrative costs and income taxes from such projects the revenue
projections were based on the potential market size that these projects address
cadences ability to gain market acceptance for these projects and the life
cycle of this inprocess technology

     estimated total revenue from the acquired inprocess technology is expected
to peak in 2001 through 2002 and decline rapidly thereafter as other new
products are expected to enter the market in addition a portion of the
anticipated revenue has been attributed to enhancements of the base technology
under development and has been excluded from net cash flow calculations
existing technology was valued at 114 million the net cash flows generated
from the acquired inprocess technology are expected to reflect

                                        35

earnings before interest taxes and depreciation of approximately 60 of the
sales generated from inprocess technology however there can be no assurance
that these assumptions will prove accurate or that cadence will realize the
anticipated benefits of this acquisition

     the discount applied to the net cash flows to calculate the present value
of such net cash flows was based on the wacc the rate used to discount the net
cash flows from purchased inprocess technology was 22

     in september 1998 cadence acquired all of the outstanding stock of ambit
for cash ambit was a leading developer of design automation technology used in
soc design the total purchase price was 255 million and the acquisition was
accounted for as a purchase

     upon consummation of the ambit acquisition cadence immediately charged to
expense 1065 million representing acquired inprocess technology that had not
yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use see
notes to consolidated financial statements the value was determined by
estimating the costs to develop the acquired inprocess technology into
commercially viable products estimating the resulting net cash flows from such
projects and discounting the net cash flows back to their present value the
discount rate included a factor that took into account the uncertainty
surrounding the successful development of the acquired inprocess technology
the acquired inprocess technology was commercially viable in 1999 with the
exception of one module called datapath compiler which became commercially
viable in 2000 buildgates 30 software and physically knowledgeable synthesis
were commercially viable in 1999 expenditures to complete all inprocess
technology did not exceed 15 million

     at the time of its acquisition by cadence ambit was working on several
significant research and development projects that were intended to provide the
next generation version of its existing product buildgates 22 the nature of
the efforts to complete the next generation version of buildgates related to the
completion of all planning designing prototyping verification and testing
activities that were necessary to establish that the proposed technologies meet
their design specifications including functional technical and economic
performance requirements

     cadence expects ambits creation of a fundamentally new approach to
synthesis in deep submicron and in soc to create the opportunity for additional
revenue through the creation of an integrated next generation version of
buildgates software

     in september 1998 cadence acquired blda for cash blda was a design
automation development organization that focused on the complex verification
challenges companies face when designing integrated circuits and nextgeneration
soc the total purchase price was 58 million and the acquisition was accounted
for as a purchase

     upon consummation of the blda acquisition cadence immediately charged to
expense 303 million representing acquired inprocess technology that had not
yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use see
notes to consolidated financial statements the value was determined by
estimating the costs to develop the acquired inprocess technology into
commercially viable products estimating the resulting net cash flows from such
projects and discounting the net cash flows back to their present value the
discount rate includes a factor that took into account the uncertainty
surrounding the successful development of the acquired inprocess technology
the acquired inprocess technology became commercially viable in 2000
expenditures to complete this inprocess technology did not exceed 5 million

     bldas inprocess research and development projects were related to its
formalcheckr and cloverr technologies blda had two major enhancements
underway for formalcheck this effort resulted in a revenuegenerating product
in 2000 bldas research and development related to clover technology involved
the design and development of new parasitic extraction tools which were
expected to substantially improve the performance and functionality of the
technology the parasitic extraction tools began generating revenue in 2000

     the net cash flows resulting from the projects underway at ambit and blda
used to value the purchased research and development were based on managements
estimates of revenue cost of revenue research and development costs selling
general and administrative costs and income taxes from such projects the

revenue projections were based on the potential market size that the projects
address cadences ability to gain market acceptance for these projects and the
life cycle of this inprocess technology

     estimated total revenue from the acquired inprocess technology is expected
to peak in 2001 through 2002 and decline rapidly in 2003 and 2004 as other new
products enter the market in addition a portion of the anticipated revenue has
been attributed to enhancements of the base technology under development and
has been excluded from net cash flow calculations existing technology was
valued at 503 million in connection with the ambit acquisition and 232
million in connection with the blda acquisition there can be no assurance that
these assumptions will prove accurate or that cadence will realize the
anticipated benefit of the acquisitions the net cash flows generated from the
acquired inprocess technology are expected to reflect earnings before interest
taxes and depreciation of approximately 38 to 49 of the sales generated from
this inprocess technology

     the discount of the net cash flows to their present value was based on the
wacc the discount rates used to discount the net cash flows from acquired
inprocess technology were 28 for ambit and 25 for blda these discount rates
reflected the uncertainty surrounding the successful development of the acquired
inprocess technology the useful life of such technology the profitability
levels of such technology if any and the uncertainty of technological
advances all of which were unknown at that time

     in march 1998 cadence acquired all of the outstanding stock of exd exd
provided asic and soc design and library development the total purchase price
was 409 million in cash and the acquisition was accounted for as a purchase

     upon consummation of the exd acquisition cadence immediately charged to
expense 284 million representing acquired inprocess technology that had not
yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use see

commercially viable products estimating the resulting net cash flows from such
projects and discounting the net cash flows back to their present value the
discount rate included a factor that took into account the uncertainty
surrounding the successful development of the acquired inprocess technology
the inprocess projects were expected to be commercially viable on dates ranging
from the end of 1998 through 2000 however the progression of these projects
became impaired in the fourth quarter of 1999 as discussed further below

     at the time of its acquisition by cadence exd had several significant
research and development projects in process that if successful would have
represented the introduction of new products and technologies to meet future
market needs these efforts included the development of new tools for library
generation delay calculation memory compilation and semiconductor
intellectual property technology these new technologies were intended to be
fully supportive of deep submicron design functions which are a critical market
requirement the nature of the efforts required to complete these research and
development projects related to varying degrees to the completion of all
planning designing prototyping verification and testing activities that were
necessary to establish that the proposed technologies meet their design
specifications including functional technical and economic performance
requirements

     the successful completion of the exd acquired inprocess projects has been
impaired and as a result differed significantly from the forecasted assumptions
in the fourth quarter of 1999 cadence recorded a 133 million asset impairment
charge this asset impairment charge resulted from reduced japanese market
opportunities and the loss of key exd employees resulting in diminished cash
flow projections cadence entered into certain support agreements with external
parties to provide support for exd software tools previously sold to cadence
customers the fair value of the exd acquired intangibles was based on an
evaluation of the present value of their estimated expected future cash flows
discounted at 16

     in february 1998 cadence acquired all of the outstanding stock of
symbionics for approximately 1 million shares of cadence common stock and 213
million of cash symbionics provided product development design services to
leading electronics manufacturers the total purchase price was 561 million
and the acquisition was accounted for as a purchase

expenditures to complete these projects did not exceed 6 million

     at the time of its acquisition by cadence symbionics was working on
several significant research and development projects that if successful would
meet future market needs these efforts involve digital television wireless
home networking cellular roaming and digital voice technologies which were
intended to ensure the longterm success and survival of the organization the

6 million there can be no assurance that these assumptions will prove
accurate or that cadence will realize the anticipated benefit of the
acquisition the net cash flows generated from the acquired inprocess
technology are expected to reflect earnings before interest and taxes of
approximately 39 of the sales generated from symbionics inprocess technology

     the discount applied to the net cash flows to calculate their present value
was based on the wacc at the time of acquisition the discount rates used to
discount the net cash flows from the acquired inprocess technology range from
225 to 275 the discount rates are sometimes higher than the wacc due to the
inherent uncertainties in the estimates including the uncertainty surrounding
the successful development of the acquired inprocess technology the useful
life of such technology the profitability levels of such technology if any
and the uncertainty of technological advances all of which were unknown at that
time

asset impairment

     in 1999 cadence incurred charges totaling 199 million in asset
impairment charges of this amount 133 million represented asset impairment
of acquired intangibles from the exd acquisition this asset impairment charge
resulted from reduced japanese market opportunities and the loss of key exd
employees resulting in diminished cash flow projections cadence entered into
certain support agreements with external parties to provide support for exd
software tools previously sold to cadence customers the fair value of the exd
acquired intangibles was based on an evaluation of the present value of the
estimated expected future cash flows discounted at 16 the remaining 66
million in asset impairment charges were incurred in connection with the
cancellation of an information technology services contract with a thirdparty
the abandonment of capitalized software development costs associated with
certain cadence products that will no longer be sold and the abandonment of
certain thirdparty software licenses that will no longer be used by cadences
design services business

restructuring

     in 1999 cadence recorded 133 million of restructuring charges that
consisted of 113 million to terminate approximately 100 employees and 2
million to downsize and close excess facilities cadences restructuring plans
were primarily aimed at reducing costs after cadence merged with quickturn
further restructuring of cadences services business in japan and severance
resulting from the resignation of cadences former chief executive officer
severance costs include severance benefits notice pay and outplacement
services all terminations and termination benefits were communicated to the
affected employees prior to yearend and substantially all remaining severance
benefits were paid in 2000

     facilities consolidation charges of 2 million were incurred in connection
with the closure of 15 quickturn facilities including 1 million to close
duplicate and excess facilities and 1 million of abandonment costs for the
related leasehold improvements closure and exit costs include payments required
under lease contracts less any applicable sublease income after the properties
were abandoned lease buyout costs restoration costs associated with certain
lease arrangements and costs to maintain facilities during the period after
abandonment assetrelated writeoffs consist of leasehold improvements of
facilities that were abandoned and whose estimated fair market value is zero as
of december 30 2000 13 of the 15 quickturn sites had been vacated
noncancelable lease payments on vacated facilities will be paid out through
2003

     in 1998 cadence recorded 695 million of restructuring charges primarily
associated with cadences worldwide restructuring plan announced in the second
half of 1998 cadences restructuring plans and associated costs consisted of
369 million to terminate approximately 700 employees 299 million to
downsize and close excess facilities and 27 million of other restructuring
expenses cadences restructuring plan was primarily aimed at reducing the cost
of excess personnel and capacity in its services business a discussion about
cadences gross margin trends for its services business can be found under cost
of revenue within this section severance costs included severance benefits
notice pay and outplacement services in 1998 approximately 101 million of
these costs resulted from the acceleration of stock options vesting under
employment agreements all terminations and termination benefits were
communicated to the affected employees prior to yearend and all remaining
severance benefits were substantially paid in 1999

     facilities consolidation charges of 299 million were incurred in
connection with the closure of 58 sales and engineering facilities including
167 million to downsize and close facilities and 132 million in abandonment
costs for the related leasehold improvements closure and exit costs included
payments required under lease contracts less any applicable sublease income
after the properties were abandoned lease buyout costs restoration costs
associated with certain lease arrangements and costs to maintain facilities
during the period after abandonment asset related costs writtenoff consist of
leasehold improvements of facilities that were abandoned and whose estimated
fair market value is zero as of december 30 2000 all but one of the 58 sites
had been vacated noncancelable lease payments on vacated facilities will be
paid out through 2008

     cadence also recorded 27 million of other restructuring charges
consisting primarily of cancellation fees associated with certain vendor and
conference arrangements and abandoned software

     liabilities for excess facilities and other restructuring charges are
included in accrued and other longterm liabilities while severance and benefits
liabilities are included in payroll and payroll related accruals actual amounts
of termination benefits facilities and other restructuring related payments can
be found in notes to consolidated financial statements under restructuring

merger costs

     in connection with the acquisition of quickturn in 1999 cadence charged to
expense merger costs of 84 million representing professional fees for
financial advisors attorneys and accountants

litigation settlement

     in 1999 cadence and mentor announced the settlement of a patent
infringement action pending in the us district court for the district of
oregon as a result the court entered a judgment declaring that certain
quickturn patents are valid enforceable and were infringed by mentors sale of
simexpress products in the

     other income net increased 32 million in 2000 when compared to 1999
primarily due to an increase in foreign exchange gains partially offset by 22
million of investment losses from a venture capital partnership shown in other
expense net other income net decreased 92 million in 1999 when compared
to 1998 primarily due to interest income reductions of 81 million and loss on
foreign exchange of 34 million the decrease in interest income was primarily
due to lower average cash and investment balances due in part to the payments
made for acquisitions the loss on foreign exchange was due to the expense of

provision for income taxes  180      27    749
effective tax rate   265    237   749


     as of december 30 2000 cadence had total net deferred tax assets of
approximately 827 million realization of the deferred tax assets will be
dependent on generating sufficient taxable income prior to the expiration of
certain net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards although realization is
not assured management believes that it is more likely than not that the net
deferred tax assets will be realized the amount of the net deferred tax assets
however could be reduced or increased in the near term if actual facts
including the estimate of future taxable income differ from those estimated

     the effective tax rate includes the writeoff of acquired inprocess
technology of approximately 207 million for 1999 and 1941 million for 1998
the effective tax rates excluding the writeoff of acquired inprocess
technology were 289 for 1999 and 284 for 1998

disclosures about market risk

interest rate risk

     cadences exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates
primarily to its investment portfolio and longterm debt obligations while
cadence is exposed with respect to interest rate fluctuations in many of the
worlds leading industrialized countries cadences interest income and expense
is most sensitive to fluctuations in the general level of us interest rates
in this regard changes in us interest rates affect the interest earned on
cadences cash and cash equivalents shortterm and longterm investments and
interest paid on its longterm debt obligations as well as costs associated with
foreign currency hedges

                                        40

     cadence invests in high quality credit issuers and by policy limits the
amount of its credit exposure to any one issuer as stated in its policy
cadences first priority is to reduce the risk of principal loss consequently
cadence seeks to preserve its invested funds by limiting default risk market
risk and reinvestment risk cadence mitigates default risk by investing in only
high quality credit securities that it believes to be low risk and by
positioning its portfolio to respond appropriately to a significant reduction in
a credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor the portfolio includes
only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure
portfolio liquidity

     on september 29 2000 cadence entered into two syndicated senior unsecured
credit facilities that allow cadence to borrow up to 350 million referred to
as the 2000 facilities the 2000 facilities replace a prior 355 million
revolving credit facility consisting of a 1775 million twoyear revolving
credit facility which was terminated on september 27 2000 and a 1775
million 364day revolving credit facility which was terminated immediately
prior to consummation of the 2000 facilities one of the new 2000 facilities is
a 100 million threeyear revolving credit facility referred to as the
threeyear facility the other new facility is a 250 million 364day revolving
credit facility convertible into a twoyear term loan referred to as the
364day facility the threeyear facility terminates on september 29 2003 the
364day facility will terminate on september 28 2001 at which time the 364day
facility may be converted to a twoyear term loan with a maturity date of
september 29 2003 or at the request of cadence and with the consent of
members of the bank group that wish to do so the termination date of the
364day facility may be extended for one additional 364day period with respect
to the portion of the 364day facility that a consenting bank holds for both
the 2000 facilities cadence has the option to pay interest based on libor plus
a spread of between 125 and 150 based on a pricing grid tied to a financial
covenant or the higher of the i federal funds rate plus 050 and ii prime
rate as a result cadences interest expenses associated with this borrowing
will vary with market rates in addition commitment fees are payable on the
unused portion of the threeyear facility at rates between 025 and 034 based
on a pricing grid tied to a financial covenant and on the unused portion of the
364day facility at a fixed rate of 020 cadence may not borrow under the
364day facility at any time that any portion of the threeyear facility remains
unused the 2000 facilities contain certain financial and other covenants as of
december 30 2000 cadence had no outstanding borrowings under these credit
facilities

     the table below presents the carrying value and related weighted average
interest rates for cadences interest bearing instruments all highly liquid
investments with an original maturity of three months or less at the date of
purchase are considered to be cash equivalents investments with original
maturities between three and 12 months are considered to be shortterm
investments investments with original maturities greater than 12 months are
considered longterm investments as of december 30 2000 all of cadences
investments have maturities of less than 12 months the carrying value
approximated fair value at december 30 2000

interest rate swap risk

     cadence entered into a 48 fixed interest rateswap in connection with its
accounts receivable financing program to modify the interest rate
characteristics of the receivables sold to a financing institution on a non
recourse basis as of december 30 2000 the notional amount payable was 87
million that will be amortized

                                        41
page   42

in quarterly installments of approximately 22 million through october 2001
the estimated fair value at december 30 2000 was negligible

foreign currency risk

     cadences operations include transactions in foreign currencies and as
such cadence benefits from a weaker dollar and is adversely affected by a
stronger dollar relative to major currencies worldwide accordingly the primary
effect of foreign currency transactions on cadences results of operations is a
reduction in revenue from a strengthening us dollar offset by a smaller
reduction in expenses

     cadence enters into foreign currency forward exchange contracts and
purchases foreign currency put options with financial institutions primarily to
protect against currency exchange risks associated with existing assets and
liabilities and probable but not firmly committed transactions respectively
forward contracts are not accounted for as hedges and therefore the unrealized
gains and losses are recognized in other income net in advance of the actual
foreign currency cash flows with the fair value of these forward contracts being
recorded as accrued liabilities

     cadence purchases put options to hedge the currency exchange risks
associated with probable but not firmly committed transactions probable but not
firmly committed transactions consist of revenue from cadences products and
maintenance contracts in a currency other than the functional currency these
transactions are made through cadences subsidiaries in ireland and japan the
premium costs of the put options are recorded in other current assets while the
gains and losses are deferred and recognized in income in the same period as the
hedged transaction gains and losses on accounting hedges realized before the
settlement date of the related hedged transaction are also generally deferred
and recognized in income in the same period as the hedged transaction cadence
does not use forward contracts and put options for trading purposes cadences
ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to currency fluctuations will depend
on the currency exchange rates and other factors in effect as the forward
contracts and put options mature

     the table below provides information as of december 30 2000 about
cadences forward contracts as of december 30 2000 there were no put options
outstanding the information is provided in us dollar equivalent amounts the
table presents the notional amounts at contract exchange rates and the
weighted average contractual foreign currency exchange rates these forward
contracts mature prior to may 17 2001

     while cadence actively manages its foreign currency risks on an ongoing
basis there can be no assurance that cadences foreign currency hedging
activities will substantially offset the impact of fluctuations in currency
exchange rates on its results of operations cash flows and financial position
on a net basis foreign currency fluctuations did not have a material impact on
cadences results of operations and financial position during the year ended
december 30 2000 the realized gain loss on the forward contracts as they
matured was not material to the consolidated operations of cadence

equity price risk

     as part of its authorized repurchase program cadence has sold put warrants
and purchased call options through equity derivative transactions the put
warrants if exercised and settled by physical delivery of shares

                                        42
page   43

would entitle the holder to sell shares of cadence common stock to cadence at a
specified price similarly the call options entitle cadence to buy shares of
cadence common stock at a specified price cadence has the option to elect net
share settlement rather than physical settlement of put warrants it issues
that are exercised that is cadence has the right to settle the exercised put
warrants with shares of cadence common stock valued at the difference between
the exercise price and the fair value of the stock at the date of exercise

     cadence repurchases shares of its common stock under stock repurchase
programs for issuance under its employee stock purchase plan or espp its 1997
stock option plan referred to as the 1997 plan and its 2000 stock option plan
referred to as the 2000 plan adopted in january 2000 as part of these
repurchase programs cadence has purchased and will purchase call options or has
sold and will sell put warrants these transactions may result in sales of a
large number of shares and consequent decline in the market price of cadence
common stock cadences stock repurchase program includes the following
characteristics

      call options allow cadence to buy shares of its common stock on a
       specified day at a specified price if the market price of the stock is
       greater than the exercise price of a call option cadence will typically
       exercise the option and receive shares of its stock if the market price
       of the common stock is less than the exercise price of a call option
       cadence typically will not exercise the option

      call option issuers may accumulate a substantial number of shares of
       cadence common stock in anticipation of cadences exercising its call
       option and may dispose of these shares if and when cadence fails to
       exercise its call option this could cause the market price of cadence
       common stock to fall

      depending on the exercise price of the put warrants and the market price
       of cadence common stock at the time of exercise net share settlement
       of the put warrants with cadence common stock could cause cadence to
       issue a substantial number of shares to the holder of the put warrant
       the holder may sell these shares in the open market which could cause
       the price of cadence common stock to fall

      put warrant holders may accumulate a substantial number of shares of
       cadence common stock in anticipation of exercising their put warrants and
       may dispose of these shares if and when they exercise their put warrants
       and cadence issues shares in settlement of their put warrants this could
       also cause the market price of cadence common stock to fall

     the table below provides information as of december 30 2000 about
cadences outstanding put warrants and call options the table presents the
contract amounts and the weighted average strike prices the put warrants and
call options expire on various dates through november 2001 and cadence has the

liquidity and capital resources

     at december 30 2000 cadences principal sources of liquidity consisted of
137 million of cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments as
compared with 1188 million at january 1 2000 and 2495 million at january
2 1999 and the 2000 facilities as of december 30 2000 cadence had no
outstanding borrowings under these credit facilities

                                        43
page   44

     cash provided by operating activities increased 149 million to 1421
million in the year ended december 30 2000 as compared to the year ended
january 1 2000 primarily due to increases in collections on outstanding
receivables and net income before unusual items cash provided by operating
activities decreased 999 million to 1272 million in the year ended january
1 2000 as compared to the year ended january 2 1999 primarily due to
decreases in net income before unusual items accounts payable and accrued
liabilities and receivables partially offset by increases in installment
contract receivables and deferred revenue

     at december 30 2000 cadence had net working capital of 653 million as
compared with 584 million at january 1 2000 the primary reasons for the
increase were increases in shortterm investments of 444 million and accounts
receivable of 414 million partially offset by an increase in deferred revenue
of 637 million

     in addition to its shortterm investments cadences primary investing
activities consisted of acquisitions and the related acquired intangibles
purchases of property plant and equipment capitalization of software
development costs and venture capital partnership investments which combined
represented 1837 million at december 30 2000 3068 million at january 1
2000 and 5913 million at january 2 1999 of cash used for investing
activities

     cadence sells put warrants and purchases call options through private
placements see notes to consolidated financial statements at december 30
2000 cadence had a maximum potential obligation related to put warrants to buy
back 55 million shares of its common stock at an aggregate price of
approximately 1259 million these put warrants expire at various dates through
november 2001 and cadence has the contractual ability to settle the put warrants
and call options prior to their maturity cadence has the ability to settle
these put warrants with its stock and therefore no amount was classified out
of stockholders equity in cadences consolidated balance sheets

     as part of its overall investment strategy cadence has become a limited
partner in a venture capital fund and is committed to invest up to 100 million
as of december 30 2000 cadence had contributed approximately 498 million to
this partnership for venture funding which is reflected in other assets in the
accompanying consolidated balance sheets net of operating losses

     on september 29 2000 cadence entered into two syndicated senior unsecured
credit facilities that allow cadence to borrow up to 350 million referred to
as the 2000 facilities the 2000 facilities replace a prior 355 million
revolving credit facility consisting of a 1775 million twoyear revolving
credit facility which was terminated on september 27 2000 and a 1775
million 364day revolving credit facility which was terminated immediately
prior to consummation of the 2000 facilities one of the new 2000 facilities is
a 100 million threeyear revolving credit facility referred to as the
threeyear facility the other new facility is a 250 million 364day revolving
credit facility convertible into a twoyear term loan referred to as the
364day facility the threeyear facility terminates on september 29 2003 the
364day facility will terminate on september 28 2001 at which time the 364day
facility may be converted to a twoyear term loan with a maturity date of
september 29 2003 or at the request of cadence and with the consent of
members of the bank group that wish to do so the termination date of the
364day facility may be extended for one additional 364day period with respect
to the portion of the 364day facility that a consenting bank holds for both
the 2000 facilities cadence has the option to pay interest based on libor plus
a spread of between 125 and 150 based on a pricing grid tied to a financial
covenant or the higher of the i federal funds rate plus 050 and ii prime
rate as a result cadences interest expenses associated with this borrowing
will vary with market rates in addition commitment fees are payable on the
unused portion of the threeyear facility at rates between 025 and 034 based
on a pricing grid tied to a financial covenant and on the unused portion of the
364day facility at a fixed rate of 020 cadence may not borrow under the
364day facility at any time that any portion of the threeyear facility remains
unused the 2000 facilities contain certain financial and other covenants as of
december 30 2000 cadence had no outstanding borrowings under these credit
facilities

     cadence anticipates that current cash and shortterm investment balances
cash flow from operations and the remaining amounts available under the 2000
facilities will be sufficient to meet its working capital and capital
requirements on a shortand longterm basis

new accounting standards

     in september 2000 the emerging issues task force or eitf published their
consensus on eitf issue no 0019 accounting for derivative financial
instruments indexed to and potentially settled in a companys own stock
which was taken up to address implementation of the eitfs march 2000 final
consensus of eitf issue no 007 application of eitf issue no 9613 to equity
derivative instruments that contain certain provisions that require net cash
settlement if certain events outside the control of the issuer occur the final
consensus in issue 007 generally stated that equity derivative contracts that
contain provisions that implicitly or explicitly require net cash settlement
outside of the control of the company must be treated as assets and liabilities
and carried at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in earnings
rather than equity instruments carried at original cost and reported as part of
permanent equity this interpretation becomes effective june 30 2001 and is not
expected to have a material effect on cadences consolidated financial position
results of operations or cash flows

     in september 2000 the fasb issued statement of financial accounting
standards or sfas no 140 accounting for transfers and servicing of
financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities sfas no 140 provides
accounting and reporting standards for transfers and servicing of financial
assets and extinguishment of liabilities it requires a company after a
transfer of financial assets to recognize the financial and servicing assets it
controls and the liabilities it has incurred derecognize financial assets when
control has been surrendered and derecognize liabilities when extinguished
this statement is effective for transfer and servicing of financial assets and
extinguishments after march 31 2001 as well as for disclosures relating to
securitization transactions for fiscal years ending after december 15 2000 the
adoption of this statement is not expected to have a material effect on
cadences consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows

interpretation no 44 accounting for certain transactions involving stock
compensation an interpretation of accounting principles board or apb opinion
no 25 this interpretation provides guidance regarding the application of apb
opinion no 25 to stock compensation involving employees this interpretation
was effective july 1 2000 and did not have a material effect on cadences
consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows

either an asset or liability measured at its fair value it requires that
changes in the derivatives fair value be recognized currently in earnings
unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met and that a company must
formally document designate and assess the effectiveness of transactions that
receive hedge accounting in june 1999 sfas no 137 accounting for derivative
instruments and hedging activities  deferral of the effective date of fasb
statement no 133 was issued the statement defers the effective date of sfas

                    report of independent public accountants

to the stockholders and board of directors of cadence design systems inc

     we have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of cadence
design systems inc a delaware corporation and subsidiaries as of december
30 2000 and january 1 2000 and the related consolidated statements of
operations stockholders equity and cash flows for each of the three fiscal
years in the period ended december 30 2000 these financial statements and the
schedule referred to below are the responsibility of cadences management our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and
schedule based on our audits we did not audit the financial statements of
quickturn design systems inc for the fiscal year ended december 31 1998 a
company acquired during 1999 in a transaction accounted for as a pooling of
interests as discussed in acquisitions in the notes to consolidated financial
statements such statements are included in the consolidated financial
statements of cadence design systems inc and reflect total revenues of eight
percent of the related consolidated total for the fiscal year ended january 2
1999 those statements were audited by other auditors whose report has been
furnished to us and our opinion insofar as it relates to amounts included for
quickturn design systems inc is based solely on the report of the other
auditors

     we conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the united states those standards require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated
financial statements are free of material misstatement an audit includes
examining on a test basis evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements an audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management as well as
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation we believe that our
audits and the report of other auditors provide a reasonable basis for our
opinion

     in our opinion based on our audits and the report of the other auditors
the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly in all
material respects the financial position of cadence design systems inc and
subsidiaries as of december 30 2000 and january 1 2000 and the results of
their operations and their cash flows for each of the three fiscal years in the
period ended december 30 2000 in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the united states

     our audits were made for the purpose of forming an opinion on the basic
financial statements taken as a whole the schedule listed in item 14 a 2 is
presented for purposes of complying with the securities and exchange
commissions rules and is not part of the basic consolidated financial
statements this schedule has been subjected to the auditing procedures applied
in the audit of the basic consolidated financial statements and in our opinion
fairly states in all material respects the financial data required to be set
forth therein in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken
as a whole

summary of significant accounting policies

     principles of consolidation and basis of presentation

     the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of cadence and
its subsidiaries after elimination of intercompany accounts and transactions
investments in companies in which ownership interests range from 20 to 50 are
accounted for using the equity method of accounting cadence has one investment
with ownership interest less than 20 which is accounted for using the equity
method of accounting due to the fact cadence has significant influence on this
investment

     cadences fiscal year end is the saturday closest to december 31 certain
prior year consolidated financial statement balances have been reclassified to
conform to the 2000 presentation

     use of estimates

     the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated
financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the
reporting period actual results could differ from those estimates

     foreign currency translation

     assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries where the functional
currency is the local currency are translated using exchange rates in effect at
the end of the period and revenue and costs are translated using average
exchange rates for the period gains and losses on the translation into us
dollars of amounts denominated in foreign currencies are included in net income
loss for those operations whose functional currency is the us dollar and as
a separate component of stockholders equity for those operations whose
functional currency is the local currency

             notes to consolidated financial statements continued

     derivative financial instruments

     cadence enters into foreign currency forward exchange contracts and
purchases foreign currency put options with financial institutions primarily to
protect against currency exchange risks associated with existing assets and
liabilities and probable but not firmly committed transactions respectively
forward contracts are not accounted for as hedges and therefore the unrealized
gains and losses are recognized in other income net in the accompanying
consolidated statements of operations in advance of the actual foreign currency
cash flows with the fair value of these forward contracts being recorded in
accrued liabilities

     cadence purchases put options to hedge the currency exchange risks
associated with probable but not firmly committed transactions probable but not
firmly committed transactions consist of revenue from cadences products and
maintenance contracts in a currency other than the functional currency these
transactions are made through cadences subsidiaries in ireland and japan the
premium costs of the put options are recorded in prepaid expenses and other
current assets while the gains and losses are deferred and recognized in income
in the same period as the hedged transaction gains and losses on accounting
hedges realized before the settlement date of the related hedged transaction are
also generally deferred and recognized in income in the same period as the
hedged transaction cadence does not use forward contracts and put options for
trading purposes cadences ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to
currency fluctuations will depend on the currency exchange rates and other
factors in effect as the forward contracts and put options mature

     revenue recognition

     product revenue consists principally of revenue earned under software
license agreements and is generally recognized upon shipment of the software if
collection of the resulting receivable is probable the fee is fixed or
determinable and vendorspecific objective evidence exists to allocate the
total fee to all delivered and undelivered elements of the arrangement if
vendorspecific objective evidence does not exist to allocate the total fee to
all delivered and undelivered elements of the arrangement revenue is deferred
until such evidence does exist for the undelivered elements or until all
elements are delivered whichever is earlier revenue associated with software
products under subscription licenses is recognized ratably over the license
period because the agreements allow customers to exchange licensed products for
unspecified future technology installment contract receivables result from
customer contracts with cadences toprated credit customers cadence uses
installment contracts as a standard business practice and has a history of
successfully collecting under the original payment terms without making
concessions on payments products or services emulation hardware product
revenue is recognized upon installation

     services revenue consists primarily of revenue received for performing
methodology and design services fixedprice methodology and design service
contracts are accounted for using contract accounting which is generally the
percentageofcompletion method versus the completedcontract method and time
and materials contracts are accounted for on a monthly basis as work is
performed in addition for small fixedpriceprojects such as training classes
and small standard methodology service engagements of approximately 10000 in
size revenue is recognized when the work is completed

     maintenance revenue consists of fees for providing technical support for
software products and software product updates and is recognized ratably over
the term of the support agreement

     comprehensive income loss

     comprehensive income loss includes foreign currency translation gains and
losses and other unrealized gains and losses that have been previously excluded
from net income loss and reflected instead in equity cadence has reported the
components of comprehensive income loss on its consolidated statements of
stockholders equity

     cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments

     cadence considers all highly liquid debt instruments including commercial
paper euro time deposits repurchase agreements and certificates of deposit
with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents
investments with original maturities greater than three months and less than one
year are classified as shortterm investments investments with original
maturities greater than one year are classified as longterm investments

     management determines the appropriate classification of its investments at
the time of purchase securities classified as heldtomaturity are stated at
amortized cost based on cadences positive intent to hold such securities until
maturity the cost of securities sold is determined using the specific
identification method when computing realized gains and losses securities
classified as availableforsale are stated at fair value with the unrealized
gains and losses reported as a component of stockholders equity until realized
the amortized cost of debt securities is adjusted for amortization of premiums
and accretion of discounts to maturity such amortization and accretion is
included in other income net

     inventories

     inventories are stated at the lower of cost firstin firstout method or
market cadences inventories include high technology parts and components for
complex computer systems that emulate the performance and operation of computer
chips and electronic systems these parts and components may be specialized in
nature or subject to rapid technological obsolescence while cadence has
programs to minimize the required inventories on hand and considers
technological obsolescence when estimating required reserves to reduce recorded
amounts to market values it is reasonably possible that such estimates could
change in the near term

     property plant and equipment

     property plant and equipment is stated at cost depreciation and
amortization are provided over the estimated useful lives using the
straightline method as follows


                                                  
computer equipment and related software          3  8 years

furniture and fixtures          3  5 years
equipment          3  5 years


     cadence capitalizes the costs of software developed for internal use in
compliance with statement of position 981 accounting for the costs of computer
software developed or obtained for internal use and with emerging issues task
force issue 002 accounting for web site development costs capitalization of
software developed for internal use and web site development costs begins at the
application development phase of the project amortization of software developed
for internal use and web site development costs begins when the products are
placed in productive use and is computed on a straightline basis over the
estimated useful life of the product generally three years

     cadence recorded depreciation expense of property plant and equipment per
abp no 12 for the fiscal years ended december 30 2000 january 1 2000 and
january 2 1999 in the amount of 767 million 680 million and 608
million respectively

     software development costs and acquired intangibles

     cadence capitalizes software development costs in compliance with statement
of financial accounting standards or sfas no 86 accounting for the costs of
computer software to be sold leased or otherwise marketed capitalization of
software development costs begins upon the establishment of technological
feasibility of the product technological feasibility is established at the
completion of detail program design and testing the establishment of
technological feasibility and the ongoing assessment of the recoverability of
these costs requires considerable judgment by management with respect to certain
external factors including but not limited to anticipated future gross product
revenue estimated economic life and changes in software and hardware
technology amortization of capitalized software development costs begins when
the products are available for general release to customers and is computed on a
straightline basis over the remaining estimated economic life of the product
which is generally three years

     cadence recorded amortization expense for software development costs per
sfas 86 for the fiscal years ended december 30 2000 january 1 2000 and
january 2 1999 in the amount of 284 million 266 million and 237
million respectively

     acquired intangibles represent purchase price in excess of acquired
tangible assets and inprocess technology in connection with business
combinations accounted for as purchases and are amortized on a straightline
basis over the remaining estimated economic life of the underlying products and
technologies original lives assigned are five to seven years

     it is reasonably possible that the estimates of anticipated future gross
revenue the remaining estimated economic life of the products and technologies
or both could differ from those used to assess the recoverability of these
costs and result in a writedown of the carrying amount or a shortened life of
both the software development costs and acquired intangibles in the near term

     longlived assets

     cadence periodically reviews longlived assets certain identifiable
intangibles and goodwill related to these assets for impairment in accordance
with sfas no 121 accounting for the impairment of longlived assets and for
longlived assets to be disposed of

     for assets to be held and used including acquired intangibles cadence
initiates its review whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that
the carrying amount of a longlived asset may not be recoverable recoverability
of an asset is measured by comparison of its carrying amount to the expected
future undiscounted cash flows without interest charges that the asset is
expected to generate any impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount
by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair market value

     assets to be disposed of and for which management has committed to a plan
to dispose of the assets whether through sale or abandonment are reported at
the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell

     concentrations of credit risk

     financial instruments including derivative financial instruments that may
potentially subject cadence to concentrations of credit risk consist
principally of cash investments shortterm investments longterm investments
accounts receivable forward contracts and put options and call options
purchased in conjunction with cadences stock repurchase programs cadences
investment policy primarily limits investments to shortterm lowrisk
instruments concentration of credit risk related to accounts receivable is
limited due to the varied customers comprising cadences customer base and
their dispersion across geographies credit exposure related to the forward
contracts and the call options is limited to the realized and unrealized gains
on

institutions with strong credit ratings which minimizes risk of loss due to
nonpayment cadence has not experienced any losses due to credit impairment
related to its financial instruments

     accrued warranty

historical relationship of revenue to warranty costs incurred

     new accounting standards

     in september 2000 the emerging issues task force or eitf published their
consensus on eitf issue no 0019 accounting for derivative financial
instruments indexed to and potentially settled in a companys own stock
which was taken up to address implementation of the eitfs march 2000 final
consensus of eitf issue no 007 application of eitf issue no 9613 to equity
derivative instruments that contain certain provisions that require net cash
settlement if certain events outside the control of the issuer occur the final
consensus in issue 007 generally stated that equity derivative contracts that
contain provisions that implicitly or explicitly require net cash settlement
outside of the control of the company must be treated as assets and liabilities
and carried at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in earnings
rather than equity instruments carried at original cost and reported as part of
permanent equity this interpretation becomes effective june 30 2001 and is not
expected to have a material effect on cadences consolidated financial position
results of operations or cash flows

     stock repurchase plan

     cadence has authorized three seasoned systematic stock repurchase programs
under which it repurchases cadence common stock to satisfy estimated
requirements for shares to be issued under its employee stock purchase plan or
espp and the 2000 and 1997 plans such repurchases are intended to cover
cadences expected reissuances under the espp and the 2000 and 1997 plans for
the next 12 months and 24 months respectively

     as part of its authorized repurchase program cadence has sold put warrants
through private placements at december 30 2000 there were 55 million put
warrants outstanding that entitle the holder to sell one share of common stock
to cadence on a specified date and at specified prices ranging from 1977 to
2439 per

share additionally during this same period cadence purchased call options
that entitle cadence to buy one share of common stock at a specified price to
satisfy anticipated stock repurchase requirements under cadences systematic
repurchase programs at december 30 2000 cadence had 4 million call options
outstanding at specified prices ranging from 2002 to 2464 per share the put
warrants and call options outstanding at december 30 2000 expire on various
dates through november 2001 and cadence has the contractual ability to settle
the options prior to their maturity at december 30 2000 the estimated fair
value of the call options was approximately 262 million and the fair value of
the put warrants was approximately 83 million

     if exercised cadence has the right to settle the put warrants with common
stock equal to the difference between the exercise price and the fair value at
the date of exercise settlement of the put warrants with common stock could
cause cadence to issue a substantial number of shares depending on the exercise
price of the put warrants and the per share fair value of cadence common stock
at the time of exercise in addition settlement of put warrants in common stock
could lead to the disposition by put warrant holders of shares of cadence common
stock that such holders may have accumulated in anticipation of the exercise of
the put warrants or call options which may adversely affect the price of
cadence common stock at december 30 2000 cadence had the ability to settle
these put warrants with common stock and therefore no amount was classified
out of stockholders equity in the consolidated balance sheets the effect of
the exercise of these put warrants and call options is reported in the line
titled purchase of treasury stock within the consolidated statements of
stockholders equity

     employee stock purchase plan

     under the espp cadence is authorized to issue up to 23500000 shares of
common stock to its employees under the terms of the espp employees can choose
to have up to 12 of their annual base earnings plus bonuses withheld to
purchase cadence common stock the purchase price of the stock is 85 of the
lesser of the fair market value as of the beginning or the end of the offering
periods the offering periods provide for concurrent 24 month offering periods
with a new 24 month offering period starting every six months each offering
period will be divided into four consecutive six month purchase periods under
the espp cadence issued 3168839 2110222 and 1252855 shares to employees
in 2000 1999 and 1998 respectively the weighted average purchase price and
the weighted average fair value of shares issued in 2000 was 936 and 2075
respectively

     cadence provides for us income taxes on the earnings of foreign
subsidiaries unless they are considered permanently invested outside of the us
at december 30 2000 the cumulative amount of earnings upon which us income
taxes have not been provided are approximately 2287 million at december 30
2000 the unrecognized deferred tax liability for these earnings was
approximately 644 million

     the net valuation allowance for provision for income taxes decreased by
152 million in 2000 the valuation allowance for provision for income taxes
decreased by 178 million due to tax planning which allowed cadence to benefit
from certain foreign deferred tax assets against domestic taxes the valuation
allowance for provision for income taxes also increased by 26 million due to
the benefit of the amortization of tality deferred stock compensation which will
only be realized if the fair market value of tality common stock on the date of
exercise is greater than the exercise price of the tality stock option

     the net valuation allowance for equity and intangibles decreased by 29
million in 2000 the valuation allowance earmarked for equity and intangibles is
due to domestic entities generating sufficient taxable income including the
deduction of stock options to realize certain domestic deferred tax assets the
remaining valuation allowanceequity and intangibles of 169 million is due to
the uncertainty of domestic entities generating sufficient taxable income
including the deduction for stock options to realize certain domestic deferred
tax assets this portion of the valuation allowance identified in the above
table as valuation allowance  equity and intangibles if realizable may
reduce other intangibles and may not be available to offset future provision for
income taxes

     the remaining net operating loss carryforwards will expire at various dates
from 2001 through 2020 and federal tax credit carryforwards will expire at
various dates from 2001 through 2015

resulted from reduced japanese market opportunities and the loss of key exd
employees resulting in diminished cash flow projections cadence entered into
certain support agreements with external parties to provide support for exd
software tools previously sold to cadence customers the fair value of the exd
acquired intangibles was based on an evaluation of the present value of the
estimated expected future cash flows discounted at 16 the remaining 66
million in asset impairment charges were incurred in connection with the
cancellation of an information technology services contract with a thirdparty
the abandonment of capitalized software development costs associated with
certain cadence products that will no longer be sold and the abandonment of

segment reporting

     in 1998 cadence adopted statement of financial accounting standards or
sfas no 131 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related
information under sfas no 131 operating segments are defined as components
of an enterprise about which separate financial information is available that is
evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker when deciding how to
allocate resources and when assessing performance cadences chief operating
decision making group is the executive staff which includes cadences president
and chief executive officer and his senior staff cadences executive staff
reviews the cadence consolidated results within three segments product
services and maintenance and also reviews talitys results separately as a
standalone entity

     the product segment includes revenue and associated costs to design and
license to customers a variety of electronic design automation products the
services segment includes revenue and associated costs to offer methodology and
design services either to assist companies in developing electronic designs or
to assume responsibility for the design effort when customers wish to outsource
this work the maintenance segment includes revenue and associated costs
primarily for a technical support organization and maintenance agreements are
offered to customers either as part of our product license agreements or
separately within the cadence consolidated results tality revenue is included
in the services segment and associated tality costs are reflected in each of
the three segments consistent with the benefit derived by the respective
segments from those services

     segment income from operations is defined as gross margin under generally
accepted accounting principles and excludes operating expenses marketing and
sales research and development and general and administrative unusual items
other income net and income taxes profitability information about cadences
segments is available only to the extent of gross margin by segment and
operating expenses and other income and expense items are managed on a
functional basis there are no differences between the accounting policies used
to measure profit and loss for segments and those used on a consolidated basis
revenue is defined as revenue from external customers with no intersegment
revenue

     cadences management does not identify or allocate its assets including
capital expenditures by operating segment accordingly assets are not being
reported by segment because the information is not available by segment and is
not reviewed by cadences executive staff to make decisions about resources to
be allocated among the segments or to assess their performance depreciation and
amortization is allocated among the segments in order to determine each
segments gross margin
