our devices are primarily manufactured by thirdparty contract manufacturers for the majority of our products we have the ability to use other manufacturers if a current vendor becomes unavailable or unable to meet our requirements however some of our products contain certain components for which there are very few qualified suppliers for these components we have limited nearterm flexibility to use other manufacturers if a current vendor becomes unavailable or is unable to meet our requirements extended disruptions at these suppliers andor manufacturers could lead to a similar disruption in our ability to manufacture devices on time to meet consumer demand

research and development 

product and service development and intellectual property 

we develop most of our products and services internally through the following engineering groups 













part i 

item 1

 

internal development allows us to maintain competitive advantages that come from product differentiation and closer technical control over our products and services it also gives us the freedom to decide which modifications and enhancements are most important and when they should be implemented we strive to obtain information as early as possible about changing usage patterns and hardware advances that may affect software and hardware design before releasing new software platforms and as we make significant modifications to existing platforms we provide application vendors with a range of resources and guidelines for development training and testing generally we also create product documentation internally 

we protect our intellectual property investments in a variety of ways we work actively in the us and internationally to ensure the enforcement of copyright trademark trade secret and other protections that apply to our software and hardware products services business plans and branding we are a leader among technology companies in pursuing patents and currently have a portfolio of over 69000 us and international patents issued and over 19000 pending worldwide while we employ much of our internallydeveloped intellectual property exclusively in our products and services we also engage in outbound licensing of specific patented technologies that are incorporated into licensees’ products from time to time we enter into broader crosslicense agreements with other technology companies covering entire groups of patents we may also purchase or license technology that we incorporate into our products and services at times we make select intellectual property broadly available at no or low cost to achieve a strategic objective such as promoting industry standards advancing interoperability supporting societal andor environmental efforts or attracting and enabling our external development community our increasing engagement with open source software will also cause us to license our intellectual property rights broadly in certain situations

while it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of our products services and business methods we believe based upon past experience and industry practice such licenses generally can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms we believe our continuing research and product development are not materially dependent on any single license or other agreement with a third party relating to the development of our products 

investing in the future 

our success is based on our ability to create new and compelling products services and experiences for our users to initiate and embrace disruptive technology trends to enter new geographic and product markets and to drive broad adoption of our products and services we invest in a range of emerging technology trends and breakthroughs that we believe offer significant opportunities to deliver value to our customers and growth for the company based on our assessment of key technology trends we maintain our longterm commitment to research and development across a wide spectrum of technologies tools and platforms spanning digital work and life experiences cloud computing ai devices and operating systems 

while our main product research and development facilities are located in redmond washington we also operate research and development facilities in other parts of the us and around the world this global approach helps us remain competitive in local markets and enables us to continue to attract top talent from across the world 

we plan to continue to make significant investments in a broad range of product research and development activities and as appropriate we will coordinate our research and development across operating segments and leverage the results across the company 

in addition to our main research and development operations we also operate microsoft research microsoft research is one of the world’s largest corporate research organizations and works in close collaboration with top universities around the world to advance the stateoftheart in computer science and a broad range of other disciplines providing us a unique perspective on future trends and contributing to our innovation 

distribution sales and marketing 

we market and distribute our products and services through the following channels oems direct and distributors and resellers our sales force performs a variety of functions including working directly with commercial enterprises and publicsector organizations worldwide to identify and meet their technology and digital transformation requirements managing oem relationships and supporting system integrators independent software vendors and other partners who engage directly with our customers to perform sales consulting and fulfillment functions for our products and services

 item 1a risk factors

our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties including those described below that could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations cash flows and the trading price of our common stock

strategic and competitive risks 

we face intense competition across all markets for our products and services which may lead to lower revenue or operating margins 

competition in the technology sector

our competitors range in size from diversified global companies with significant research and development resources to small specialized firms whose narrower product lines may let them be more effective in deploying technical marketing and financial resources barriers to entry in many of our businesses are low and many of the areas in which we compete evolve rapidly with changing and disruptive technologies shifting user needs and frequent introductions of new products and services our ability to remain competitive depends on our success in making innovative products devices and services that appeal to businesses and consumers 

competition among platformbased ecosystems

an important element of our business model has been to create platformbased ecosystems on which many participants can build diverse solutions a wellestablished ecosystem creates beneficial network effects among users application developers and the platform provider that can accelerate growth establishing significant scale in the marketplace is necessary to achieve and maintain attractive margins we face significant competition from firms that provide competing platforms 







part i 

item 1a

 

business model competition 

companies compete with us based on a growing variety of business models 







the competitive pressures described above may cause decreased sales volumes price reductions andor increased operating costs such as for research and development marketing and sales incentives this may lead to lower revenue gross margins and operating income 

our increasing focus on cloudbased services presents execution and competitive risks a growing part of our business involves cloudbased services available across the spectrum of computing devices our strategic vision is to compete and grow by building bestinclass platforms and productivity services for an intelligent cloud and an intelligent edge infused with artificial intelligence “ai” at the same time our competitors are rapidly developing and deploying cloudbased services for consumers and business customers pricing and delivery models are evolving devices and form factors influence how users access services in the cloud and sometimes the user’s choice of which cloudbased services to use we are devoting significant resources to develop and deploy our cloudbased strategies the windows ecosystem must continue to evolve with this changing environment we embrace cultural and organizational changes to drive accountability and eliminate obstacles to innovation our intelligent cloud and intelligent edge worldview is connected with the growth of the internet of things “iot” our success in the iot will depend on the level of adoption of our offerings such as azure azure stack azure iot edge and azure sphere we may not establish market share sufficient to achieve scale necessary to meet our business objectives 

besides software development costs we are incurring costs to build and maintain infrastructure to support cloud computing services these costs will reduce the operating margins we have previously achieved whether we succeed in cloudbased services depends on our execution in several areas including 











it is uncertain whether our strategies will attract the users or generate the revenue required to succeed if we are not effective in executing organizational and technical changes to increase efficiency and accelerate innovation or if we fail to generate sufficient usage of our new products and services we may not grow revenue in line with the infrastructure and development investments described above this may negatively impact gross margins and operating income

item 1a

 

risks relating to the evolution of our business 

we make significant investments in products and services that may not achieve expected returns we will continue to make significant investments in research development and marketing for existing products services and technologies including the windows operating system microsoft 365 office bing sql server windows server azure office 365 xbox linkedin and other products and services we also invest in the development and acquisition of a variety of hardware for productivity communication and entertainment including pcs tablets gaming devices and hololens investments in new technology are speculative commercial success depends on many factors including innovativeness developer support and effective distribution and marketing if customers do not perceive our latest offerings as providing significant new functionality or other value they may reduce their purchases of new software and hardware products or upgrades unfavorably affecting revenue we may not achieve significant revenue from new product service and distribution channel investments for several years if at all new products and services may not be profitable and even if they are profitable operating margins for some new products and businesses will not be as high as the margins we have experienced historically we may not get engagement in certain features like edge and bing that drive postsale monetization opportunities our data handling practices across our products and services will continue to be under scrutiny and perceptions of mismanagement driven by regulatory activity or negative public reaction to our practices or product experiences could negatively impact product and feature adoption product design and product quality 

developing new technologies is complex it can require long development and testing periods significant delays in new releases or significant problems in creating new products or services could adversely affect our revenue 

acquisitions joint ventures and strategic alliances may have an adverse effect on our business we expect to continue making acquisitions and entering into joint ventures and strategic alliances as part of our longterm business strategy for example in march 2021 we completed our acquisition of zenimax media inc for 81 billion and in march 2022 we completed our acquisition of nuance communications inc for 188 billion in january 2022 we announced a definitive agreement to acquire activision blizzard  inc for 687 billion   these acquisitions and other transactions and arrangements involve significant challenges and risks including that they do not advance our business strategy that we get an unsatisfactory return on our investment that they raise new compliancerelated obligations and challenges that we have difficulty integrating and retaining new employees business systems and technology that they distract management from our other businesses or that announced transactions may not be completed if an arrangement fails to adequately anticipate changing circumstances and interests of a party it may result in early termination or renegotiation of the arrangement the success of these transactions and arrangements will depend in part on our ability to leverage them to enhance our existing products and services or develop compelling new ones as well as acquired companies’ ability to meet our policies and processes in areas such as data governance privacy and cybersecurity it may take longer than expected to realize the full benefits from these transactions and arrangements such as increased revenue or enhanced efficiencies or the benefits may ultimately be smaller than we expected these events could adversely affect our consolidated financial statements 

if our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets become impaired we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings we acquire other companies and intangible assets and may not realize all the economic benefit from those acquisitions which could cause an impairment of goodwill or intangibles we review our amortizable intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable we test goodwill for impairment at least annually factors that may be a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets may not be recoverable include a decline in our stock price and market capitalization reduced future cash flow estimates and slower growth rates in industry segments in which we participate we have in the past recorded and may in the future be required to record a significant charge in our consolidated financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets is determined negatively affecting our results of operations

cybersecurity data privacy and platform abuse risks 

cyberattacks and security vulnerabilities could lead to reduced revenue increased costs liability claims or harm to our reputation or competitive position 

security of our information technology

threats to it security can take a variety of forms individual and groups of hackers and sophisticated organizations including statesponsored organizations or nationstates continuously undertake attacks that pose threats to our customers and our it these actors may use a wide variety of methods which may include developing and deploying malicious software or exploiting vulnerabilities in hardware software or other infrastructure in order to attack our products and services or gain access to our networks and datacenters using social engineering techniques to induce our employees users partners or customers to disclose passwords or other sensitive information or take other actions to gain access to our data or our users’ or customers’ data or acting in a coordinated manner to launch distributed denial of service or other coordinated attacks nationstate and statesponsored actors can deploy significant resources to plan and carry out exploits nationstate attacks against us or our customers may intensify during periods of intense diplomatic or armed conflict such as the ongoing conflict in ukraine inadequate account security practices may also result in unauthorized access to confidential data for example system administrators may fail to timely remove employee account access when no longer appropriate employees or third parties may intentionally compromise our or our users’ security or systems or reveal confidential information malicious actors may employ the it supply chain to introduce malware through software updates or compromised supplier accounts or hardware

cyberthreats are constantly evolving and becoming increasingly sophisticated and complex increasing the difficulty of detecting and successfully defending against them we may have no current capability to detect certain vulnerabilities which may allow them to persist in the environment over long periods of time cyberthreats can have cascading impacts that unfold with increasing speed across our internal networks and systems and those of our partners and customers breaches of our facilities network or data security could disrupt the security of our systems and business applications impair our ability to provide services to our customers and protect the privacy of their data result in product development delays compromise confidential or technical business information harming our reputation or competitive position result in theft or misuse of our intellectual property or other assets subject us to ransomware attacks require us to allocate more resources to improve technologies or remediate the impacts of attacks or otherwise adversely affect our business

the cyberattacks uncovered in late 2020 known as “solorigate” or “nobelium” are an example of a supply chain attack where malware was introduced to a software provider’s customers including us through software updates the attackers were later able to create false credentials that appeared legitimate to certain customers’ systems we may be targets of further attacks similar to solorigatenobelium as both a supplier and consumer of it

in addition our internal it environment continues to evolve often we are early adopters of new devices and technologies we embrace new ways of sharing data and communicating internally and with partners and customers using methods such as social networking and other consumeroriented technologies our business policies and internal security controls may not keep pace with these changes as new threats emerge or emerging cybersecurity regulations in jurisdictions worldwide

security of our products services devices and customers’ data 

the security of our products and services is important in our customers’ decisions to purchase or use our products or services across cloud and onpremises environments security threats are a significant challenge to companies like us whose business is providing technology products and services to others threats to our own it infrastructure can also affect our customers customers using our cloudbased services rely on the security of our infrastructure including hardware and other elements provided by third parties to ensure the reliability of our services and the protection of their data adversaries tend to focus their efforts on the most popular operating systems programs and services including many of ours and we expect that to continue in addition adversaries can attack our customers’ onpremises or cloud environments sometimes exploiting previously unknown “zero day” vulnerabilities such as occurred in early calendar year 2021 with several of our exchange server onpremises products vulnerabilities in these or any product can persist even after we have issued security patches if customers have not installed the most recent updates or if the attackers exploited the vulnerabilities before patching to install additional malware to further compromise customers’ systems adversaries will continue to attack customers using our cloud services as customers embrace digital transformation adversaries that acquire user account information can use that information to compromise our users’ accounts including where accounts share the same attributes such as passwords inadequate account security practices may also result in unauthorized access and user activity may result in ransomware or other malicious software impacting a customer’s use of our products or services we are increasingly incorporating open source software into our products there may be vulnerabilities in open source software that may make our products susceptible to cyberattacks

our customers operate complex it systems with thirdparty hardware and software from multiple vendors that may include systems acquired over many years they expect our products and services to support all these systems and products including those that no longer incorporate the strongest current security advances or standards as a result we may not be able to discontinue support in our services for a product service standard or feature solely because a more secure alternative is available failure to utilize the most current security advances and standards can increase our customers’ vulnerability to attack further customers of widely varied size and technical sophistication use our technology and consequently may have limited capabilities and resources to help them adopt and implement state of the art cybersecurity practices and technologies in addition we must account for this wide variation of technical sophistication when defining default settings for our products and services including security default settings as these settings may limit or otherwise impact other aspects of it operations and some customers may have limited capability to review and reset these defaults

cyberattacks such as solorigatenobelium may adversely impact our customers even if our production services are not directly compromised we are committed to notifying our customers whose systems have been impacted as we become aware and have available information and actions for customers to help protect themselves we are also committed to providing guidance and support on detection tracking and remediation we may not be able to detect the existence or extent of these attacks for all of our customers or have information on how to detect or track an attack especially where an attack involves onpremises software such as exchange server where we may have no or limited visibility into our customers’ computing environments

development and deployment of defensive measures

to defend against security threats to our internal it systems our cloudbased services and our customers’ systems we must continuously engineer more secure products and services enhance security and reliability features improve the deployment of software updates to address security vulnerabilities in our own products as well as those provided by others develop mitigation technologies that help to secure customers from attacks even when software updates are not deployed maintain the digital security infrastructure that protects the integrity of our network products and services and provide security tools such as firewalls antivirus software and advanced security and information about the need to deploy security measures and the impact of doing so customers in certain industries such as financial services health care and government may have enhanced or specialized requirements to which we must engineer our products and services

item 1a

 

the cost of measures to protect products and customerfacing services could reduce our operating margins if we fail to do these things well actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products and services data corruption issues or reduced performance could harm our reputation and lead customers to reduce or delay future purchases of products or subscriptions to services or to use competing products or services customers may also spend more on protecting their existing computer systems from attack which could delay adoption of additional products or services customers and third parties granted access to their systems may fail to update their systems continue to run software or operating systems we no longer support or may fail timely to install or enable security patches or may otherwise fail to adopt adequate security practices any of these could adversely affect our reputation and revenue actual or perceived vulnerabilities may lead to claims against us our license agreements typically contain provisions that eliminate or limit our exposure to liability but there is no assurance these provisions will withstand legal challenges at times to achieve commercial objectives we may enter into agreements with larger liability exposure to customers 

our products operate in conjunction with and are dependent on products and components across a broad ecosystem of third parties if there is a security vulnerability in one of these components and if there is a security exploit targeting it we could face increased costs liability claims reduced revenue or harm to our reputation or competitive position

disclosure and misuse of personal data could result in liability and harm our reputation as we continue to grow the number breadth and scale of our cloudbased offerings we store and process increasingly large amounts of personal data of our customers and users the continued occurrence of highprofile data breaches provides evidence of an external environment increasingly hostile to information security despite our efforts to improve the security controls across our business groups and geographies it is possible our security controls over personal data our training of employees and third parties on data security and other practices we follow may not prevent the improper disclosure or misuse of customer or user data we or our vendors store and manage in addition third parties who have limited access to our customer or user data may use this data in unauthorized ways improper disclosure or misuse could harm our reputation lead to legal exposure to customers or users or subject us to liability under laws that protect personal data resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue our software products and services also enable our customers and users to store and process personal data onpremises or increasingly in a cloudbased environment we host government authorities can sometimes require us to produce customer or user data in response to valid legal orders in the us and elsewhere we advocate for transparency concerning these requests and appropriate limitations on government authority to compel disclosure despite our efforts to protect customer and user data perceptions that the collection use and retention of personal information is not satisfactorily protected could inhibit sales of our products or services and could limit adoption of our cloudbased solutions by consumers businesses and government entities additional security measures we may take to address customer or user concerns or constraints on our flexibility to determine where and how to operate datacenters in response to customer or user expectations or governmental rules or actions may cause higher operating expenses or hinder growth of our products and services 

we may not be able to protect information in our products and services from use by others  linkedin and other microsoft products and services contain valuable information and content protected by contractual restrictions or technical measures in certain cases we have made commitments to our members and users to limit access to or use of this information changes in the law or interpretations of the law may weaken our ability to prevent third parties from scraping or gathering information or content through use of bots or other measures and using it for their own benefit thus diminishing the value of our products and services

the development of the iot presents security privacy and execution risks to support the growth of the intelligent cloud and the intelligent edge we are developing products services and technologies to power the iot a network of distributed and interconnected devices employing sensors data and computing capabilities including ai the iot’s great potential also carries substantial risks iot products and services may contain defects in design manufacture or operation that make them insecure or ineffective for their intended purposes an iot solution has multiple layers of hardware sensors processors software and firmware several of which we may not develop or control each layer including the weakest layer can impact the security of the whole system many iot devices have limited interfaces and ability to be updated or patched iot solutions may collect large amounts of data and our handling of iot data may not satisfy customers or regulatory requirements iot scenarios may increasingly affect personal health and safety if iot solutions that include our technologies do not work as intended violate the law or harm individuals or businesses we may be subject to legal claims or enforcement actions these risks if realized may increase our costs damage our reputation or brands or negatively impact our revenues or margins 

issues in the development and use of ai may result in reputational harm or liability  we are building ai into many of our offerings including our productivity services and we are also making first and thirdparty ai available for our customers to use in solutions that they build we expect these elements of our business to grow we envision a future in which ai operating in our devices applications and the cloud helps our customers be more productive in their work and personal lives as with many innovations ai presents risks and challenges that could affect its adoption and therefore our business ai algorithms may be flawed datasets may be insufficient or contain biased information ineffective or inadequate ai development or deployment practices by microsoft or others could result in incidents that impair the acceptance of ai solutions or cause harm to individuals or society these deficiencies and other failures of ai systems could subject us to competitive harm regulatory action legal liability including under new proposed legislation regulating ai in jurisdictions such as the european union “eu” and brand or reputational harm some ai scenarios present ethical issues if we enable or offer ai solutions that are controversial because of their impact on human rights privacy employment or other social economic or political issues we may experience brand or reputational harm 

operational risks 

we may have excessive outages data losses and disruptions of our online services if we fail to maintain an adequate operations infrastructure our increasing user traffic growth in services and the complexity of our products and services demand more computing power we spend substantial amounts to build purchase or lease datacenters and equipment and to upgrade our technology and network infrastructure to handle more traffic on our websites and in our datacenters our datacenters depend on predictable energy and networking supplies the cost or availability of which could be adversely affected by a variety of factors including the transition to a clean energy economy and geopolitical disruptions these demands continue to increase as we introduce new products and services and support the growth of existing services such as bing azure microsoft account services microsoft 365 microsoft teams dynamics 365 onedrive sharepoint online skype xbox and outlookcom we are rapidly growing our business of providing a platform and backend hosting for services provided by third parties to their end users maintaining securing and expanding this infrastructure is expensive and complex and requires development of principles for datacenter builds in geographies with higher safety risks it requires that we maintain an internet connectivity infrastructure and storage and compute capacity that is robust and reliable within competitive and regulatory constraints that continue to evolve inefficiencies or operational failures including temporary or permanent loss of customer data insufficient internet connectivity or inadequate storage and compute capacity could diminish the quality of our products services and user experience resulting in contractual liability claims by customers and other third parties regulatory actions damage to our reputation and loss of current and potential users subscribers and advertisers each of which may adversely impact our consolidated financial statements

we may experience quality or supply problems our hardware products such as xbox consoles surface devices and other devices we design and market are highly complex and can have defects in design manufacture or associated software we could incur significant expenses lost revenue and reputational harm as a result of recalls safety alerts or product liability claims if we fail to prevent detect or address such issues through design testing or warranty repairs 

our software products and services also may experience quality or reliability problems the highly sophisticated software we develop may contain bugs and other defects that interfere with their intended operation our customers increasingly rely on us for critical business functions and multiple workloads many of our products and services are interdependent with one another each of these circumstances potentially magnifies the impact of quality or reliability issues any defects we do not detect and fix in prerelease testing could cause reduced sales and revenue damage to our reputation repair or remediation costs delays in the release of new products or versions or legal liability although our license agreements typically contain provisions that eliminate or limit our exposure to liability there is no assurance these provisions will withstand legal challenge

there are limited suppliers for certain device and datacenter components our competitors use some of the same suppliers and their demand for hardware components can affect the capacity available to us if components are delayed or become unavailable whether because of supplier capacity constraint industry shortages legal or regulatory changes that restrict supply sources or other reasons we may not obtain timely replacement supplies resulting in reduced sales or inadequate datacenter capacity component shortages excess or obsolete inventory or price reductions resulting in inventory adjustments may increase our cost of revenue xbox consoles surface devices datacenter servers and other hardware are assembled in asia and other geographies that may be subject to disruptions in the supply chain resulting in shortages that would affect our revenue and operating margins 

legal regulatory and litigation risks 

government litigation and regulatory activity relating to competition rules may limit how we design and market our products as a leading global software and device maker government agencies closely scrutinize us under us and foreign competition laws governments are actively enforcing competition laws and regulations and this includes scrutiny in potentially large markets such as the eu the us and china some jurisdictions also allow competitors or consumers to assert claims of anticompetitive conduct us federal and state antitrust authorities have previously brought enforcement actions and continue to scrutinize our business 

the european commission “the commission” closely scrutinizes the design of highvolume microsoft products and the terms on which we make certain technologies used in these products such as file formats programming interfaces and protocols available to other companies flagship product releases such as windows can receive significant scrutiny under competition laws for example in 2004 the commission ordered us to create new versions of our windows operating system that do not include certain multimedia technologies and to provide our competitors with specifications for how to implement certain proprietary windows communications protocols in their own products in 2009 the commission accepted a set of commitments we offered to address the commission’s concerns relating to competition in web browsing software including an undertaking to address commission concerns relating to interoperability the web browsing commitments expired in 2014 the remaining obligations may limit our ability to innovate in windows or other products in the future diminish the developer appeal of the windows platform and increase our product development costs the availability of licenses related to protocols and file formats may enable competitors to develop software products that better mimic the functionality of our products which could hamper sales of our products 

our portfolio of firstparty devices continues to grow at the same time our oem partners offer a large variety of devices for our platforms as a result increasingly we both cooperate and compete with our oem partners creating a risk that we fail to do so in compliance with competition rules regulatory scrutiny in this area may increase certain foreign governments particularly in china and other countries in asia have advanced arguments under their competition laws that exert downward pressure on royalties for our intellectual property

government regulatory actions and court decisions such as these may result in fines or hinder our ability to provide the benefits of our software to consumers and businesses reducing the attractiveness of our products and the revenue that come s from them new competition law actions could be initiated potentially using previous actions as precedent the outcome of such actions or steps taken to avoid them could adversely affect us in a variety of ways including 











our global operations subject us to potential consequences under anticorruption trade and other laws and regulations the foreign corrupt practices act “fcpa” and other anticorruption laws and regulations “anticorruption laws” prohibit corrupt payments by our employees vendors or agents and the accounting provisions of the fcpa require us to maintain accurate books and records and adequate internal controls from time to time we receive inquiries from authorities in the us and elsewhere which may be based on reports from employees and others about our business activities outside the us and our compliance with anticorruption laws periodically we receive such reports directly and investigate them and also cooperate with investigations by us and foreign law enforcement authorities an example of increasing international regulatory complexity is the eu whistleblower directive initiated in 2021 which may present compliance challenges to the extent it is implemented in different forms by eu member states most countries in which we operate also have competition laws that prohibit competitors from colluding or otherwise attempting to reduce competition between themselves while we devote substantial resources to our us and international compliance programs and have implemented policies training and internal controls designed to reduce the risk of corrupt payments and collusive activity our employees vendors or agents may violate our policies our failure to comply with anticorruption laws or competition laws could result in significant fines and penalties criminal sanctions against us our officers or our employees prohibitions on the conduct of our business and damage to our reputation 

increasing trade laws policies sanctions and other regulatory requirements also affect our operations in and outside the us relating to trade and investment economic sanctions in the us the eu and other countries prohibit most business with restricted entities or countries such as crimea cuba iran north korea and syria us export controls restrict microsoft from offering many of its products and services to or making investments in certain entities in specified countries us import controls restrict us from integrating certain information and communication technologies into our supply chain and allow for government review of transactions involving information and communications technology from countries determined to be foreign adversaries periods of intense diplomatic or armed conflict such as the ongoing conflict in ukraine may result in 1 new and rapidly evolving sanctions and trade restrictions which may impair trade with sanctioned individuals and countries and 2 negative impacts to regional trade ecosystems among our customers partners and us noncompliance with sanctions as well as general ecosystem disruptions could result in reputational harm operational delays monetary fines loss of revenues increased costs loss of export privileges or criminal sanctions

other regulatory areas that may apply to our products and online services offerings include requirements related to user privacy telecommunications data storage and protection advertising and online content for example some regulators are taking the position that our offerings such as microsoft teams and skype are covered by existing laws regulating telecommunications services and some new laws  including eu member state laws under the european electronic communications code are defining more of our services as regulated telecommunications services this trend may continue and will result in these offerings being subjected to additional data protection security and law enforcement surveillance obligations regulators may assert that our collection use and management of customer data and other information is inconsistent with their laws and regulations  including laws that apply to the tracking of users via technology such as cookies  legislative or regulatory action relating to cybersecurity requirements may increase the costs to develop implement or secure our products and services legislative and regulatory action is emerging in the area s of ai and content moderation which could increase costs or restrict opportunity applying these laws and regulations to our business is often unclear subject to change over time and sometimes may conflict from jurisdiction to jurisdiction additionally these laws and governments’ approach to their enforcement and our products and services are continuing to evolve compliance with these types of regulation may involve significant costs or require changes in products or business practices that result in reduced revenue noncompliance could result in the imposition of penalties or orders we stop the alleged noncompliant activity 

we strive to empower all people and organizations to achieve more and accessibility of our products is an important aspect of this goal there is increasing pressure from advocacy groups regulators competitors customers and other stakeholders to make technology more accessible if our products do not meet customer expectations or global accessibility requirements we could lose sales opportunities or face regulatory or legal actions

laws and regulations relating to the handling of personal data may impede the adoption of our services or result in increased costs legal claims fines against us or reputational damage the growth of our internet and cloudbased services internationally relies increasingly on the movement of data across national boundaries legal requirements relating to the collection storage handling and transfer of personal data continue to evolve for example in july 2020 the court of justice of the eu invalidated a framework called privacy shield for companies to transfer data from eu member states to the united states this ruling continues to generate uncertainty about the legal requirements for data transfers from the eu under other legal mechanisms and has resulted in some eu data protection authorities blocking the use of usbased services that involve the transfer of data to the us the us and the eu in march 2022 agreed in principle on a replacement framework for the privacy shield called the transatlantic data privacy framework a failure of the us and eu to finalize the transatlantic data privacy framework could compound that uncertainty and result in additional blockages of data transfers potential new rules and restrictions on the flow of data across borders could increase the cost and complexity of delivering our products and services in some markets for example the eu general data protection regulation “gdpr” applies to all of our activities conducted from an establishment in the eu or related to products and services offered in the eu imposes a range of compliance obligations regarding the handling of personal data more recently the eu has been developing new requirements related to the use of data including in the digital markets act the digital services act and the data act that will add additional rules and restriction on the use of data in our products and services engineering efforts to build and maintain capabilities to facilitate compliance with these laws involve substantial expense and the diversion of engineering resources from other projects we might experience reduced demand for our offerings if we are unable to engineer products that meet our legal duties or help our customers meet their obligations under the gdpr and other data regulations or if our implementation to comply with the gdpr makes our offerings less attractive compliance with these obligations depends in part on how particular regulators interpret and apply them if we fail to comply or if regulators assert we have failed to comply including in response to complaints made by customers it may lead to regulatory enforcement actions which can result in monetary penalties of up to 4 of worldwide revenue in the case of gdpr private lawsuits reputational damage blockage of international data transfers and loss of customers the highest fines assessed under gdpr have recently been increasing especially against large technology companies jurisdictions around the world such as china india and states in the us have adopted or are considering adopting or expanding laws and regulations imposing obligations regarding the handling or transfer of personal data

the company’s investment in gaining insights from data is becoming central to the value of the services we deliver to customers to our operational efficiency and key opportunities in monetization customer perceptions of quality and operational efficiency our ability to use data in this way may be constrained by regulatory developments that impede realizing the expected return from this investment ongoing legal analyses reviews and inquiries by regulators of microsoft practices or relevant practices of other organizations may result in burdensome or inconsistent requirements including data sovereignty and localization requirements affecting the location movement collection and use of our customer and internal employee data as well as the management of that data compliance with applicable laws and regulations regarding personal data may require changes in services business practices or internal systems that result in increased costs lower revenue reduced efficiency or greater difficulty in competing with foreignbased firms compliance with data regulations might limit our ability to innovate or offer certain features and functionality in some jurisdictions where we operate failure to comply with existing or new rules may result in significant penalties or orders to stop the alleged noncompliant activity as well as negative publicity and diversion of management time and effort 

we have claims and lawsuits against us that may result in adverse outcomes we are subject to a variety of claims and lawsuits these claims may arise from a wide variety of business practices and initiatives including major new product releases such as windows significant business transactions warranty or product claims and employment practices adverse outcomes in some or all of these claims may result in significant monetary damages or injunctive relief that could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business the litigation and other claims are subject to inherent uncertainties and management’s view of these matters may change in the future a material adverse impact in our consolidated financial statements could occur for the period in which the effect of an unfavorable outcome becomes probable and reasonably estimable 

our business with government customers may present additional uncertainties we derive substantial revenue from government contracts government contracts generally can present risks and challenges not present in private commercial agreements for instance we may be subject to government audits and investigations relating to these contracts we could be suspended or debarred as a governmental contractor we could incur civil and criminal fines and penalties and under certain circumstances contracts may be rescinded some agreements may allow a government to terminate without cause and provide for higher liability limits for certain losses some contracts may be subject to periodic funding approval reductions or delays which could adversely impact publicsector demand for our products and services these events could negatively impact our results of operations financial condition and reputation 

we may have additional tax liabilities we are subject to income taxes in the us and many foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes in the course of our business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain for example compliance with the 2017 united states tax cuts and jobs act “tcja” and possible future legislative changes may require the collection of information not regularly produced within the company the use of estimates in our consolidated financial statements and the exercise of significant judgment in accounting for its provisions as regulations and guidance evolve with respect to the tcja or possible future legislative changes and as we gather more information and perform more analysis our results may differ from previous estimates and may materially affect our consolidated financial statements 

we regularly are under audit by tax authorities in different jurisdictions although we believe that our provision for income taxes and our tax estimates are reasonable tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken in addition economic and political pressures to increase tax revenue in various jurisdictions may make resolving tax disputes favorably more difficult we are currently under internal revenue service audit for prior tax years with the primary unresolved issues relating to transfer pricing the final resolution of those audits and other audits or litigation may differ from the amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements and may materially affect our consolidated financial statements in the period or periods in which that determination is made 

we earn a significant amount of our operating income outside the us a change in the mix of earnings and losses in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in our business or structure or the expiration of or disputes about certain tax agreements in a particular country may result in higher effective tax rates for the company in addition changes in us federal and state or international tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals other fundamental law changes currently being considered by many countries including in the us and changes in taxing jurisdictions’ administrative interpretations decisions policies and positions may materially adversely impact our consolidated financial statements

intellectual property risks 

we may not be able to protect our source code from copying if there is an unauthorized disclosure source code the detailed program commands for our operating systems and other software programs is critical to our business although we license portions of our application and operating system source code to several licensees we take significant measures to protect the secrecy of large portions of our source code if our source code leaks we might lose future trade secret protection for that code it may then become easier for third parties to compete with our products by copying functionality which could adversely affect our revenue and operating margins unauthorized disclosure of source code also could increase the security risks described elsewhere in these risk factors 

legal changes our evolving business model piracy and other factors may decrease the value of our intellectual property protecting our intellectual property rights and combating unlicensed copying and use of our software and other intellectual property on a global basis is difficult while piracy adversely affects us revenue the impact on revenue from outside the us is more significant particularly countries in which the legal system provides less protection for intellectual property rights our revenue in these markets may grow more slowly than the underlying device market similarly the absence of harmonized patent laws makes it more difficult to ensure consistent respect for patent rights throughout the world we educate users about the benefits of licensing genuine products and obtaining indemnification benefits for intellectual property risks and we educate lawmakers about the advantages of a business climate where intellectual property rights are protected reductions in the legal protection for software intellectual property rights could adversely affect revenue 

we expend significant resources to patent the intellectual property we create with the expectation that we will generate revenues by incorporating that intellectual property in our products or services or in some instances by licensing or crosslicensing our patents to others in return for a royalty andor increased freedom to operate changes in the law may continue to weaken our ability to prevent the use of patented technology or collect revenue for licensing our patents these include legislative changes and regulatory actions that make it more difficult to obtain injunctions and the increasing use of legal process to challenge issued patents similarly licensees of our patents may fail to satisfy their obligations to pay us royalties or may contest the scope and extent of their obligations the royalties we can obtain to monetize our intellectual property may decline because of the evolution of technology price changes in products using licensed patents greater value from crosslicensing or the difficulty of discovering infringements finally our increasing engagement with open source software will also cause us to license our intellectual property rights broadly in certain situations and may negatively impact revenue

third parties may claim we infringe their intellectual property rights from time to time others claim we infringe their intellectual property rights the number of these claims may grow because of constant technological change in the markets in which we compete the extensive patent coverage of existing technologies the rapid rate of issuance of new patents and our offering of firstparty devices such as surface to resolve these claims we may enter into royalty and licensing agreements on terms that are less favorable than currently available stop selling or redesign affected products or services or pay damages to satisfy indemnification commitments with our customers these outcomes may cause operating margins to decline besides money damages in some jurisdictions plaintiffs can seek injunctive relief that may limit or prevent importing marketing and selling our products or services that have infringing technologies in some countries such as germany an injunction can be issued before the parties have fully litigated the validity of the underlying patents we have paid significant amounts to settle claims related to the use of technology and intellectual property rights and to procure intellectual property rights as part of our strategy to manage this risk and may continue to do so 

general risks 

if our reputation or our brands are damaged our business and operating results may be harmed  our reputation and brands are globally recognized and are important to our business our reputation and brands affect our ability to attract and retain consumer business and publicsector customers there are numerous ways our reputation or brands could be damaged these include product safety or quality issues our environmental impact and sustainability supply chain practices or human rights record we may experience backlash from customers government entities advocacy groups employees and other stakeholders that disagree with our product offering decisions or public policy positions damage to our reputation or our brands may occur from among other things

item 1a

 





the proliferation of social media may increase the likelihood speed and magnitude of negative brand events if our brands or reputation are damaged it could negatively impact our revenues or margins or ability to attract the most highly qualified employees

adverse economic or market conditions may harm our business worsening economic conditions including inflation recession pandemic or other changes in economic conditions may cause lower it spending and adversely affect our revenue if demand for pcs servers and other computing devices declines or consumer or business spending for those products declines our revenue will be adversely affected 

our product distribution system relies on an extensive partner and retail network oems building devices that run our software have also been a significant means of distribution the impact of economic conditions on our partners such as the bankruptcy of a major distributor oem or retailer could cause sales channel disruption 

challenging economic conditions also may impair the ability of our customers to pay for products and services they have purchased as a result allowances for doubtful accounts and writeoffs of accounts receivable may increase 

we maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings types and maturities these investments are subject to general credit liquidity market and interest rate risks which may be exacerbated by market downturns or events that affect global financial markets a significant part of our investment portfolio comprises us government securities if global financial markets decline for long periods or if there is a downgrade of the us government credit rating due to an actual or threatened default on government debt our investment portfolio may be adversely affected and we could determine that more of our investments have experienced a decline in fair value requiring impairment charges that could adversely affect our consolidated financial statements

catastrophic events or geopolitical conditions may disrupt our business a disruption or failure of our systems or operations because of a major earthquake weather event cyberattack terrorist attack pandemic or other catastrophic event could cause delays in completing sales providing services or performing other critical functions our corporate headquarters a significant portion of our research and development activities and certain other essential business operations are in the seattle washington area and we have other business operations in the silicon valley area of california both of which are seismically active regions a catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our critical business or it systems or the infrastructure or systems they rely on such as power grids could harm our ability to conduct normal business operations providing our customers with more services and solutions in the cloud puts a premium on the resilience of our systems and strength of our business continuity management plans and magnifies the potential impact of prolonged service outages in our consolidated financial statements 

abrupt political change terrorist activity and armed conflict such as the ongoing conflict in ukraine pose a risk of general economic disruption in affected countries which may increase our operating costs and negatively impact our ability to sell to and collect from customers in affected markets these conditions also may add uncertainty to the timing and budget for technology investment decisions by our customers and may cause supply chain disruptions for hardware manufacturers geopolitical change may result in changing regulatory systems and requirements and market interventions that could impact our operating strategies access to national regional and global markets hiring and profitability geopolitical instability may lead to sanctions and impact our ability to do business in some markets or with some publicsector customers any of these changes may negatively impact our revenues 

the occurrence of regional epidemics or a global pandemic such as covid19 may adversely affect our operations financial condition and results of operations the covid19 pandemic has had widespread rapidly evolving and unpredictable impacts on global society economies financial markets and business practices the extent to which global pandemics impact our business going forward will depend on factors such as the duration and scope of the pandemic governmental business and individuals actions in response to the pandemic and the impact on economic activity including the possibility of recession or financial market instability

the longterm effects of climate change on the global economy and the it industry in particular are unclear environmental regulations or changes in the supply demand or available sources of energy or other resources may affect the availability or cost of goods and services including natural resources necessary to run our business changes in climate where we operate may increase the costs of powering and cooling computer hardware we use to develop software and provide cloudbased services

our global business exposes us to operational and economic risks our customers are located throughout the world and a significant part of our revenue comes from international sales the global nature of our business creates operational economic and geopolitical risks our results of operations may be affected by global regional and local economic developments monetary policy inflation and recession as well as political and military disputes in addition our international growth strategy includes certain markets the developing nature of which presents several risks including deterioration of social political labor or economic conditions in a country or region and difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations emerging nationalist and protectionist trends and concerns about human rights and political expression in specific countries may significantly alter the trade and commercial environments changes to trade policy or agreements as a result of populism protectionism or economic nationalism may result in higher tariffs local sourcing initiatives and nonlocal sourcing restrictions export controls investment restrictions or other developments that make it more difficult to sell our products in foreign countries disruptions of these kinds in developed or emerging markets could negatively impact demand for our products and services or increase operating costs although we hedge a portion of our international currency exposure significant fluctuations in foreign exchange rates between the us dollar and foreign currencies may adversely affect our results of operations 

our business depends on our ability to attract and retain talented employees our business is based on successfully attracting and retaining talented employees representing diverse backgrounds experiences and skill sets the market for highly skilled workers and leaders in our industry is extremely competitive maintaining our brand and reputation as well as a diverse and inclusive work environment that enables all our employees to thrive are important to our ability to recruit and retain employees we are also limited in our ability to recruit internationally by restrictive domestic immigration laws changes to us immigration policies that restrain the flow of technical and professional talent may inhibit our ability to adequately staff our research and development efforts if we are less successful in our recruiting efforts or if we cannot retain highly skilled workers and key leaders our ability to develop and deliver successful products and services may be adversely affected effective succession planning is also important to our longterm success failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution how employmentrelated laws are interpreted and applied to our workforce practices may result in increased operating costs and less flexibility in how we meet our workforce needs our global workforce is primarily nonunionized but we have several unions and works councils outside of the united states in the us there has been a general increase in workers exercising their right to form or join a union while microsoft has not received such petitions in the us the unionization of significant employee populations could result in higher costs and other operational changes necessary to respond to changing conditions and to establish new relationships with worker representatives

economic conditions challenges and risks 

the markets for software devices and cloudbased services are dynamic and highly competitive our competitors are developing new software and devices while also deploying competing cloudbased services for consumers and businesses the devices and form factors customers prefer evolve rapidly and influence how users access services in the cloud and in some cases the user’s choice of which suite of cloudbased services to use we must continue to evolve and adapt over an extended time in pace with this changing environment the investments we are making in infrastructure and devices will continue to increase our operating costs and may decrease our operating margins

our success is highly dependent on our ability to attract and retain qualified employees we hire a mix of university and industry talent worldwide we compete for talented individuals globally by offering an exceptional working environment broad customer reach scale in resources the ability to grow one’s career across many different products and businesses and competitive compensation and benefits aggregate demand for our software services and devices is correlated to global macroeconomic and geopolitical factors which remain dynamic

our devices are primarily manufactured by thirdparty contract manufacturers some of which contain certain components for which there are very few qualified suppliers for these components we have limited nearterm flexibility to use other manufacturers if a current vendor becomes unavailable or is unable to meet our requirements extended disruptions at these suppliers andor manufacturers could lead to a similar disruption in our ability to manufacture devices on time to meet consumer demand

our international operations provide a significant portion of our total revenue and expenses many of these revenue and expenses are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar as a result changes in foreign exchange rates may significantly affect revenue and expenses fluctuations in the us dollar relative to certain foreign currencies did not have a material impact on reported revenue or expenses from our international operations in fiscal year 2022

refer to risk factors part i item 1a of this form 10k for a discussion of these factors and other risks

seasonality

our revenue fluctuates quarterly and is generally higher in the second and fourth quarters of our fiscal year second quarter revenue is driven by corporate yearend spending trends in our major markets and holiday season spending by consumers and fourth quarter revenue is driven by the volume of multiyear onpremises contracts executed during the period

we use derivative instruments to manage risks related to foreign currencies equity prices interest rates and credit enhance investment returns and facilitate portfolio diversification gains and losses from changes in fair values of derivatives that are not designated as hedging instruments are primarily recognized in other income expense net 

interest and dividends income decreased due to lower portfolio balances interest expense decreased due to a decrease in outstanding longterm debt due to debt maturities net recognized gains on investments decreased primarily due to lower gains on equity securities 

income taxes 

effective tax rate

our effective tax rate for fiscal years 2022 and 2021 was 13 and 14 respectively the decrease in our effective tax rate was primarily due to a 33 billion net income tax benefit in the first quarter of fiscal year 2022 related to the transfer of intangible properties offset in part by changes in the mix of our income before income taxes between the us and foreign countries as well as tax benefits in the prior year from the india supreme court decision on withholding taxes in the case of engineering analysis centre of excellent private limited vs the commissioner of income tax an agreement between the us and india tax authorities related to transfer pricing and final tax cuts and jobs act “tcja” regulations

in the first quarter of fiscal year 2022 we transferred certain intangible properties from our puerto rico subsidiary to the us the transfer of intangible properties resulted in a 33 billion net income tax benefit in the first quarter of fiscal year 2022 as the value of future us tax deductions exceeds the current tax liability from the us global intangible lowtaxed income tax

we have historically paid india withholding taxes on software sales through distributor withholding and tax audit assessments in india in march 2021 the india supreme court ruled favorably for companies in 86 separate appeals some dating back to 2012 holding that software sales are not subject to india withholding taxes although we were not a party to the appeals our software sales in india were determined to be not subject to withholding taxes therefore we recorded a net income tax benefit of 620 million in the third quarter of fiscal year 2021 to reflect the results of the india supreme court decision impacting fiscal year 1996 through fiscal year 2016

our effective tax rate was lower than the us federal statutory rate primarily due to the net income tax benefit related to the transfer of intangible properties earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting from producing and distributing our products and services through our foreign regional operations center in ireland and tax benefits relating to stockbased compensation 

the mix of income before income taxes between the us and foreign countries impacted our effective tax rate as a result of the geographic distribution of and customer demand for our products and services in fiscal year 2022 our us income before income taxes was 478 billion and our foreign income before income taxes was 359 billion in fiscal year 2021 our us income before income taxes was 350 billion and our foreign income before income taxes was 361 billion

uncertain tax positions 

we settled a portion of the internal revenue service “irs” audit for tax years 2004 to 2006 in fiscal year 2011 in february 2012 the irs withdrew its 2011 revenue agents report related to unresolved issues for tax years 2004 to 2006 and reopened the audit phase of the examination we also settled a portion of the irs audit for tax years 2007 to 2009 in fiscal year 2016 and a portion of the irs audit for tax years 2010 to 2013 in fiscal year 2018 in the second quarter of fiscal year 2021 we settled an additional portion of the irs audits for tax years 2004 to 2013 and made a payment of 17 billion including tax and interest we remain under audit for tax years 2004 to 2017 

as of june 30 2022 the primary unresolved issues for the irs audits relate to transfer pricing which could have a material impact in our consolidated financial statements when the matters are resolved we believe our allowances for income tax contingencies are adequate we have not received a proposed assessment for the unresolved key transfer pricing issues and do not expect a final resolution of these issues in the next 12 months based on the information currently available we do not anticipate a significant increase or decrease to our tax contingencies for these issues within the next 12 months

we are subject to income tax in many jurisdictions outside the us our operations in certain jurisdictions remain subject to examination for tax years 1996 to 2021 some of which are currently under audit by local tax authorities the resolution of each of these audits is not expected to be material to our consolidated financial statements

nongaap financial measures 

adjusted net income and adjusted diluted eps are nongaap financial measures which exclude the net tax benefit related to the transfer of intangible properties in the first quarter of fiscal year 2022 and the net income tax benefit related to an india supreme court decision on withholding taxes in the third quarter of fiscal year 2021 we believe these nongaap measures aid investors by providing additional insight into our operational performance and help clarify trends affecting our business for comparability of reporting management considers nongaap measures in conjunction with gaap financial results in evaluating business performance these nongaap financial measures presented should not be considered a substitute for or superior to the measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with gaap

the following table reconciles our financial results reported in accordance with gaap to nongaap financial results

liquidity and capital resources 

we expect existing cash cash equivalents shortterm investments cash flows from operations and access to capital markets to continue to be sufficient to fund our operating activities and cash commitments for investing and financing activities such as dividends share repurchases debt maturities material capital expenditures and the transition tax related to the tcja for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future 

cash cash equivalents and investments 

cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments totaled 1048 billion and 1303 billion as of june 30 2022 and 2021 respectively equity investments were 69 billion and 60 billion as of june 30 2022 and 2021 respectively our shortterm investments are primarily intended to facilitate liquidity and capital preservation they consist predominantly of highly liquid investmentgrade fixedincome securities diversified among industries and individual issuers the investments are predominantly us dollardenominated securities but also include foreign currencydenominated securities to diversify risk our fixedincome investments are exposed to interest rate risk and credit risk the credit risk and average maturity of our fixedincome portfolio are managed to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain fixedincome indices the settlement risk related to these investments is insignificant given that the shortterm investments held are primarily highly liquid investmentgrade fixedincome securities 

valuation 

in general and where applicable we use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities to determine the fair value of our financial instruments this pricing methodology applies to our level 1 investments such as us government securities common and preferred stock and mutual funds if quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities are not available to determine fair value then we use quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities or inputs other than the quoted prices that are observable either directly or indirectly this pricing methodology applies to our level 2 investments such as commercial paper certificates of deposit us agency securities foreign government bonds mortgage and assetbacked securities corporate notes and bonds and municipal securities level 3 investments are valued using internallydeveloped models with unobservable inputs assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis using unobservable inputs are an immaterial portion of our portfolio 

a majority of our investments are priced by pricing vendors and are generally level 1 or level 2 investments as these vendors either provide a quoted market price in an active market or use observable inputs for their pricing without applying significant adjustments broker pricing is used mainly when a quoted price is not available the investment is not priced by our pricing vendors or when a broker price is more reflective of fair values in the market in which the investment trades our brokerpriced investments are generally classified as level 2 investments because the broker prices these investments based on similar assets without applying significant adjustments in addition all our brokerpriced investments have a sufficient level of trading volume to demonstrate that the fair values used are appropriate for these investments our fair value processes include controls that are designed to ensure appropriate fair values are recorded these controls include model validation review of key model inputs analysis of periodoverperiod fluctuations and independent recalculation of prices where appropriate 

cash flows 

cash from operations increased 123 billion to 890 billion for fiscal year 2022 mainly due to an increase in cash received from customers offset in part by an increase in cash paid to suppliers and employees cash used in financing increased 104 billion to 589 billion for fiscal year 2022 mainly due to a 53 billion increase in common stock repurchases and a 53 billion increase in repayments of debt cash used in investing increased 27 billion to 303 billion for fiscal year 2022 mainly due to a 131 billion increase in cash used for acquisitions of companies net of cash acquired and purchases of intangible and other assets and a 33 billion increase in additions to property and equipment offset in part by a 156 billion increase in cash from net investment purchases sales and maturities

debt proceeds

we issue debt to take advantage of favorable pricing and liquidity in the debt markets reflecting our credit rating and the low interest rate environment the proceeds of these issuances were or will be used for general corporate purposes which may include among other things funding for working capital capital expenditures repurchases of capital stock acquisitions and repayment of existing debt in march 2021 and june 2020 we exchanged a portion of our existing debt at a premium for cash and new debt with longer maturities to take advantage of favorable financing rates in the debt markets reflecting our credit rating and the low interest rate environment refer to note 11 – debt of the notes to financial statements part ii item 8 of this form 10k for further discussion

income taxes

as a result of the tcja we are required to pay a onetime transition tax on deferred foreign income not previously subject to us income tax under the tcja the transition tax is payable in interestfree installments over eight years with 8 due in each of the first five years 15 in year six 20 in year seven and 25 in year eight we have paid transition tax of 62 billion which included 15 billion for fiscal year 2022 the remaining transition tax of 120 billion is payable over the next four years with 13 billion payable within 12 months 

provisions enacted in the tcja related to the capitalization for tax purposes of research and experimental expenditures became effective on july 1 2022 these provisions require us to capitalize research and experimental expenditures and amortize them on the us tax return over five or fifteen years depending on where research is conducted the final foreign tax credit regulations also effective on july 1 2022 introduced significant changes to foreign tax credit calculations in the us tax return while these provisions are not expected to have a material impact on our fiscal year 2023 effective tax rate on a net basis our cash paid for taxes would increase unless these provisions are postponed or modified through legislative processes

we will continue to invest in sales marketing product support infrastructure and existing and advanced areas of technology as well as continue making acquisitions that align with our business strategy additions to property and equipment will continue including new facilities datacenters and computer systems for research and development sales and marketing support and administrative staff we expect capital expenditures to increase in coming years to support growth in our cloud offerings we have operating and finance leases for datacenters corporate offices research and development facilities microsoft experience centers and certain equipment we have not engaged in any related party transactions or arrangements with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect liquidity or the availability of capital resources 

recent accounting guidance 

refer to note 1 – accounting policies of the notes to financial statements part ii item 8 of this form 10k for further discussion

critical accounting estimates 

our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with gaap preparing consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses critical accounting estimates are those estimates that involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and could have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations we have critical accounting estimates in the areas of revenue recognition impairment of investment securities goodwill research and development costs legal and other contingencies income taxes and inventories 

revenue recognition 

our contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer determining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together may require significant judgment when a cloudbased service includes both onpremises software licenses and cloud services judgment is required to determine whether the software license is considered distinct and accounted for separately or not distinct and accounted for together with the cloud service and recognized over time certain cloud services primarily office 365 depend on a significant level of integration interdependency and interrelation between the desktop applications and cloud services and are accounted for together as one performance obligation revenue from office 365 is recognized ratably over the period in which the cloud services are provided 

judgment is required to determine the standalone selling price “ssp for each distinct performance obligation we use a single amount to estimate ssp for items that are not sold separately including onpremises licenses sold with sa or software updates provided at no additional charge we use a range of amounts to estimate ssp when we sell each of the products and services separately and need to determine whether there is a discount to be allocated based on the relative ssp of the various products and services 

in instances where ssp is not directly observable such as when we do not sell the product or service separately we determine the ssp using information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs we typically have more than one ssp for individual products and services due to the stratification of those products and services by customers and circumstances in these instances we may use information such as the size of the customer and geographic region in determining the ssp 

due to the various benefits from and the nature of our sa program judgment is required to assess the pattern of delivery including the exercise pattern of certain benefits across our portfolio of customers 

part ii 

item 7

 

our products are generally sold with a right of return we may provide other credits or incentives and in certain instances we estimate customer usage of our products and services which are accounted for as variable consideration when determining the amount of revenue to recognize returns and credits are estimated at contract inception and updated at the end of each reporting period if additional information becomes available changes to our estimated variable consideration were not material for the periods presented 

impairment of investment securities 

we review debt investments quarterly for credit losses and impairment if the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value we evaluate among other factors general market conditions credit quality of debt instrument issuers and the extent to which the fair value is less than cost this determination requires significant judgment in making this judgment we employ a systematic methodology that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments in addition we consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the investee if we have plans to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery then a decline in fair value below cost is recorded as an impairment charge in other income expense net and a new cost basis in the investment is established if market industry andor investee conditions deteriorate we may incur future impairments 

equity investments without readily determinable fair values are written down to fair value if a qualitative assessment indicates that the investment is impaired and the fair value of the investment is less than carrying value we perform a qualitative assessment on a periodic basis we are required to estimate the fair value of the investment to determine the amount of the impairment loss once an investment is determined to be impaired an impairment charge is recorded in other income expense net 

goodwill 

we allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the business combination we evaluate our reporting units on an annual basis and if necessary reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level operating segment or one level below an operating segment on an annual basis may 1 for us and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value these events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate legal factors operating performance indicators competition or sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit 

application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment including the identification of reporting units assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units assignment of goodwill to reporting units and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit the fair value of each reporting unit is estimated primarily through the use of a discounted cash flow methodology this analysis requires significant judgments including estimation of future cash flows which is dependent on internal forecasts estimation of the longterm rate of growth for our business estimation of the useful life over which cash flows will occur and determination of our weighted average cost of capital 

the estimates used to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit change from year to year based on operating results market conditions and other factors changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and goodwill impairment for each reporting unit 

research and development costs 

costs incurred internally in researching and developing a computer software product are charged to expense until technological feasibility has been established for the product once technological feasibility is established software costs are capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers judgment is required in determining when technological feasibility of a product is established we have determined that technological feasibility for our software products is reached after all highrisk development issues have been resolved through coding and testing generally this occurs shortly before the products are released to production the amortization of these costs is included in cost of revenue over the estimated life of the products

legal and other contingencies 

the outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought against us are subject to significant uncertainty an estimated loss from a loss contingency such as a legal proceeding or claim is accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated in determining whether a loss should be accrued we evaluate among other factors the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss changes in these factors could materially impact our consolidated financial statements

income taxes 

the objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity’s financial statements or tax returns we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement accounting literature also provides guidance on derecognition of income tax assets and liabilities classification of deferred income tax assets and liabilities accounting for interest and penalties associated with tax positions and income tax disclosures judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our consolidated financial statements 

inventories 

inventories are stated at average cost subject to the lower of cost or net realizable value cost includes materials labor and manufacturing overhead related to the purchase and production of inventories net realizable value is the estimated selling price less estimated costs of completion disposal and transportation we regularly review inventory quantities on hand future purchase commitments with our suppliers and the estimated utility of our inventory these reviews include analysis of demand forecasts product life cycle status product development plans current sales levels pricing strategy and component cost trends if our review indicates a reduction in utility below carrying value we reduce our inventory to a new cost basis through a charge to cost of revenue

change in accounting estimate 

in july 2022 we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our server and network equipment due to investments in software that increased efficiencies in how we operate our server and network equipment as well as advances in technology we determined we should increase the estimated useful lives of both server and network equipment from four years to six years this change in accounting estimate will be effective beginning fiscal year 2023 based on the carrying amount of server and network equipment included in property and equipment net as of june 30 2022 it is estimated this change will increase our fiscal year 2023 operating income by 37 billion we had previously increased the estimated useful lives of both server and network equipment in july 2020

while it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of our products services and business methods we believe based upon past experience and industry practice such licenses generally can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms we believe our continuing research and product development are not materially dependent on any single license or other agreement with a third party relating to the development of our products 

investing in the future 

our success is based on our ability to create new and compelling products services and experiences for our users to initiate and embrace disruptive technology trends to enter new geographic and product markets and to drive broad adoption of our products and services we invest in a range of emerging technology trends and breakthroughs that we believe offer significant opportunities to deliver value to our customers and growth for the company based on our assessment of key technology trends we maintain our longterm commitment to research and development across a wide spectrum of technologies tools and platforms spanning digital work and life experiences cloud computing ai devices and operating systems 

while our main product research and development facilities are located in redmond washington we also operate research and development facilities in other parts of the us and around the world this global approach helps us remain competitive in local markets and enables us to continue to attract top talent from across the world

 item 1a risk factors 

our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties including those described below that could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations cash flows and the trading price of our common stock

strategic and competitive risks 

we face intense competition across all markets for our products and services which may lead to lower revenue or operating margins 

competition in the technology sector

our competitors range in size from diversified global companies with significant research and development resources to small specialized firms whose narrower product lines may let them be more effective in deploying technical marketing and financial resources barriers to entry in many of our businesses are low and many of the areas in which we compete evolve rapidly with changing and disruptive technologies shifting user needs and frequent introductions of new products and services our ability to remain competitive depends on our success in making innovative products devices and services that appeal to businesses and consumers 

competition among platformbased ecosystems

an important element of our business model has been to create platformbased ecosystems on which many participants can build diverse solutions a wellestablished ecosystem creates beneficial network effects among users application developers and the platform provider that can accelerate growth establishing significant scale in the marketplace is necessary to achieve and maintain attractive margins we face significant competition from firms that provide competing platforms 







part i 

item 1a

 

business model competition 

companies compete with us based on a growing variety of business models 







the competitive pressures described above may cause decreased sales volumes price reductions andor increased operating costs such as for research and development marketing and sales incentives this may lead to lower revenue gross margins and operating income 

our increasing focus on cloudbased services presents execution and competitive risks a growing part of our business involves cloudbased services available across the spectrum of computing devices our strategic vision is to compete and grow by building bestinclass platforms and productivity services for an intelligent cloud and an intelligent edge infused with artificial intelligence “ai” at the same time our competitors are rapidly developing and deploying cloudbased services for consumers and business customers pricing and delivery models are evolving devices and form factors influence how users access services in the cloud and sometimes the user’s choice of which cloudbased services to use we are devoting significant resources to develop and deploy our cloudbased strategies the windows ecosystem must continue to evolve with this changing environment we embrace cultural and organizational changes to drive accountability and eliminate obstacles to innovation our intelligent cloud and intelligent edge worldview is connected with the growth of the internet of things “iot” our success in the iot will depend on the level of adoption of our offerings such as azure azure stack azure iot edge and azure sphere we may not establish market share sufficient to achieve scale necessary to achieve our business objectives 

besides software development costs we are incurring costs to build and maintain infrastructure to support cloud computing services these costs will reduce the operating margins we have previously achieved whether we succeed in cloudbased services depends on our execution in several areas including 











it is uncertain whether our strategies will attract the users or generate the revenue required to succeed if we are not effective in executing organizational and technical changes to increase efficiency and accelerate innovation or if we fail to generate sufficient usage of our new products and services we may not grow revenue in line with the infrastructure and development investments described above this may negatively impact gross margins and operating income

item 1a

 

risks relating to the evolution of our business 

we make significant investments in products and services that may not achieve expected returns we will continue to make significant investments in research development and marketing for existing products services and technologies including the windows operating system microsoft 365 office bing sql server windows server azure office 365 xbox linkedin and other products and services we also invest in the development and acquisition of a variety of hardware for productivity communication and entertainment including pcs tablets gaming devices and hololens investments in new technology are speculative commercial success depends on many factors including innovativeness developer support and effective distribution and marketing if customers do not perceive our latest offerings as providing significant new functionality or other value they may reduce their purchases of new software and hardware products or upgrades unfavorably affecting revenue we may not achieve significant revenue from new product service and distribution channel investments for several years if at all new products and services may not be profitable and even if they are profitable operating margins for some new products and businesses will not be as high as the margins we have experienced historically we may not get engagement in certain features like edge and bing that drive postsale monetization opportunities our data handling practices across our products and services will continue to be under scrutiny and perceptions of mismanagement driven by regulatory activity or negative public reaction to our practices or product experiences which could negatively impact product and feature adoption product design and product quality 

developing new technologies is complex it can require long development and testing periods significant delays in new releases or significant problems in creating new products or services could adversely affect our revenue 

acquisitions joint ventures and strategic alliances may have an adverse effect on our business we expect to continue making acquisitions and entering into joint ventures and strategic alliances as part of our longterm business strategy for example in october 2018 we completed our acquisition of github inc “github” for 75 billion in march 2021 we completed our acquisition of zenimax media inc for 81 billion and in april 2021 we announced a definitive agreement to acquire nuance communications inc for 197 billion   these acquisitions and other transactions and arrangements involve significant challenges and risks including that they do not advance our business strategy that we get an unsatisfactory return on our investment that we have difficulty integrating and retaining new employees business systems and technology that they distract management from our other businesses or that announced transactions may not be completed if an arrangement fails to adequately anticipate changing circumstances and interests of a party it may result in early termination or renegotiation of the arrangement the success of these transactions and arrangements will depend in part on our ability to leverage them to enhance our existing products and services or develop compelling new ones it may take longer than expected to realize the full benefits from these transactions and arrangements such as increased revenue or enhanced efficiencies or the benefits may ultimately be smaller than we expected these events could adversely affect our consolidated financial statements 

if our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets become impaired we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings we acquire other companies and intangible assets and may not realize all the economic benefit from those acquisitions which could cause an impairment of goodwill or intangibles we review our amortizable intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable we test goodwill for impairment at least annually factors that may be a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets may not be recoverable include a decline in our stock price and market capitalization reduced future cash flow estimates and slower growth rates in industry segments in which we participate we have in the past recorded and may in the future be required to record a significant charge in our consolidated financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets is determined negatively affecting our results of operations

cybersecurity data privacy and platform abuse risks 

cyberattacks and security vulnerabilities could lead to reduced revenue increased costs liability claims or harm to our reputation or competitive position 

security of our information technology

threats to it security can take a variety of forms individual and groups of hackers and sophisticated organizations including statesponsored organizations or nationstates continuously undertake attacks that pose threats to our customers and our it these actors may use a wide variety of methods which may include developing and deploying malicious software or exploiting vulnerabilities in hardware software or other infrastructure in order to attack our products and services or gain access to our networks and datacenters using social engineering techniques to induce our employees users partners or customers to disclose passwords or other sensitive information or take other actions to gain access to our data or our users’ or customers’ data or acting in a coordinated manner to launch distributed denial of service or other coordinated attacks nation state and state sponsored actors can deploy significant resources to plan and carry out exploits inadequate account security practices may also result in unauthorized access to confidential data for example system administrators may fail to timely remove employee account access when no longer appropriate employees or third parties may intentionally compromise our or our users’ security or systems or reveal confidential information malicious actors may employ the it supply chain to introduce malware through software updates or compromised supplier accounts or hardware

cyberthreats are constantly evolving and becoming increasingly sophisticated and complex increasing the difficulty of detecting and successfully defending against them we may have no current capability to detect certain vulnerabilities which may allow them to persist in the environment over long periods of time cyberthreats can have cascading impacts that unfold with increasing speed across our internal networks and systems and those of our partners and customers breaches of our facilities network or data security could disrupt the security of our systems and business applications impair our ability to provide services to our customers and protect the privacy of their data result in product development delays compromise confidential or technical business information harming our reputation or competitive position result in theft or misuse of our intellectual property or other assets require us to allocate more resources to improve technologies or remediate the impacts of attacks or otherwise adversely affect our business

the cyberattacks uncovered in late 2020 known as “solorigate” or “nobelium” are an example of a supply chain attack where malware was introduced to a software provider’s customers including us through software updates the attackers were later able to create false credentials that appeared legitimate to certain customers’ systems we may be targets of further attacks similar to solorigatenobelium as both a supplier and consumer of it

in addition our internal it environment continues to evolve often we are early adopters of new devices and technologies we embrace new ways of sharing data and communicating internally and with partners and customers using methods such as social networking and other consumeroriented technologies our business policies and internal security controls may not keep pace with these changes as new threats emerge

security of our products services devices and customers’ data 

the security of our products and services is important in our customers’ decisions to purchase or use our products or services across cloud and onpremises environments security threats are a significant challenge to companies like us whose business is providing technology products and services to others threats to our own it infrastructure can also affect our customers customers using our cloudbased services rely on the security of our infrastructure including hardware and other elements provided by third parties to ensure the reliability of our services and the protection of their data adversaries tend to focus their efforts on the most popular operating systems programs and services including many of ours and we expect that to continue in addition adversaries can attack our customers’ onpremises or cloud environments sometimes exploiting previously unknown “zero day” vulnerabilities such as occurred in early calendar year 2021 with several of our exchange server onpremises products vulnerabilities in these or any product can persist even after we have issued security patches if customers have not installed the most recent updates or if the attackers exploited the vulnerabilities before patching to install additional malware to further compromise customers’ systems adversaries will continue to attack customers using our cloud services as customers embrace digital transformation adversaries that acquire user account information can use that information to compromise our users’ accounts including where accounts share the same attributes as passwords inadequate account security practices may also result in unauthorized access and user activity may result in ransomware or other malicious software impacting a customer’s use of our products or services we are increasingly incorporating open source software into our products there may be vulnerabilities in open source software that may make our products susceptible to cyberattacks

our customers operate complex it systems with thirdparty hardware and software from multiple vendors that may include systems acquired over many years they expect our products and services to support all these systems and products including those that no longer incorporate the strongest current security advances or standards as a result we may not be able to discontinue support in our services for a product service standard or feature solely because a more secure alternative is available failure to utilize the most current security advances and standards can increase our customers’ vulnerability to attack further customers of widely varied size and technical sophistication use our technology and consequently may have limited capabilities and resources to help them adopt and implement state of the art cybersecurity practices and technologies in addition we must account for this wide variation of technical sophistication when defining default settings for our products and services including security default settings as these settings may limit or otherwise impact other aspects of it operations and some customers may have limited capability to review and reset these defaults

the solorigatenobelium or similar cyberattacks may adversely impact our customers even if our production services are not directly compromised we are committed to notifying our customers whose systems have been impacted as we become aware and have available information and actions for customers to help protect themselves we are also committed to providing guidance and support on detection tracking and remediation we may not be able to detect the existence or extent of these attacks for all of our customers or have information on how to detect or track an attack especially where an attack involves onpremises software such as exchange server where we may have no or limited visibility into our customers’ computing environments

development and deployment of defensive measures

to defend against security threats to our internal it systems our cloudbased services and our customers’ systems we must continuously engineer more secure products and services enhance security and reliability features improve the deployment of software updates to address security vulnerabilities in our own products as well as those provided by others develop mitigation technologies that help to secure customers from attacks even when software updates are not deployed maintain the digital security infrastructure that protects the integrity of our network products and services and provide security tools such as firewalls antivirus software and advanced security and information about the need to deploy security measures and the impact of doing so customers in certain industries such as financial services health care and government may have enhanced or specialized requirements to which we must engineer our product and services

part i 

item 1a

 

the cost of measures to protect products and customerfacing services could reduce our operating margins if we fail to do these things well actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products and services data corruption issues or reduced performance could harm our reputation and lead customers to reduce or delay future purchases of products or subscriptions to services or to use competing products or services customers may also spend more on protecting their existing computer systems from attack which could delay adoption of additional products or services customers and third parties granted access to their systems may fail to update their systems continue to run software or operating systems we no longer support or may fail timely to install or enable security patches or may otherwise fail to adopt adequate security practices any of these could adversely affect our reputation and revenue actual or perceived vulnerabilities may lead to claims against us our license agreements typically contain provisions that eliminate or limit our exposure to liability but there is no assurance these provisions will withstand legal challenges at times to achieve commercial objectives we may enter into agreements with larger liability exposure to customers 

our products operate in conjunction with and are dependent on products and components across a broad ecosystem of third parties if there is a security vulnerability in one of these components and if there is a security exploit targeting it we could face increased costs liability claims reduced revenue or harm to our reputation or competitive position

disclosure and misuse of personal data could result in liability and harm our reputation as we continue to grow the number and scale of our cloudbased offerings we store and process increasingly large amounts of personally identifiable information of our customers and users the continued occurrence of highprofile data breaches provides evidence of an external environment increasingly hostile to information security despite our efforts to improve the security controls across our business groups and geographies it is possible our security controls over personal data our training of employees and third parties on data security and other practices we follow may not prevent the improper disclosure or misuse of customer or user data we or our vendors store and manage in addition third parties who have limited access to our customer or user data may use this data in unauthorized ways improper disclosure or misuse could harm our reputation lead to legal exposure to customers or users or subject us to liability under laws that protect personal data resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue our software products and services also enable our customers and users to store and process personal data onpremises or increasingly in a cloudbased environment we host government authorities can sometimes require us to produce customer or user data in response to valid legal orders in the us and elsewhere we advocate for transparency concerning these requests and appropriate limitations on government authority to compel disclosure despite our efforts to protect customer and user data perceptions that the collection use and retention of personal information is not satisfactorily protected could inhibit sales of our products or services and could limit adoption of our cloudbased solutions by consumers businesses and government entities additional security measures we may take to address customer or user concerns or constraints on our flexibility to determine where and how to operate datacenters in response to customer or user expectations or governmental rules or actions may cause higher operating expenses or hinder growth of our products and services 

we may not be able to protect information in our products and services from use by others  linkedin and other microsoft products and services contain valuable information and content protected by contractual restrictions or technical measures in certain cases we have made commitments to our members and users to limit access to or use of this information changes in the law or interpretations of the law may weaken our ability to prevent third parties from scraping or gathering information or content through use of bots or other measures and using it for their own benefit thus diminishing the value of our products and services 

abuse of our platforms may harm our reputation or user engagement 

advertising professional and social platform abuses 

for platform products and services that provide content or host ads that come from or can be influenced by third parties including github linkedin microsoft advertising msn and xbox our reputation or user engagement may be negatively affected by activity that is hostile or inappropriate this activity may come from users impersonating other people or organizations use of our products or services to spread terrorist or violent extremist content or to disseminate information that may be viewed as misleading or intended to manipulate the opinions of our users or the use of our products or services that violates our terms of service or otherwise for objectionable or illegal ends preventing or responding to these actions may require us to make substantial investments in people and technology and these investments may not be successful adversely affecting our business and consolidated financial statements

digital safety and service misuse 

our hosted consumer services as well as our enterprise services may be used by third parties to disseminate harmful or illegal content in violation of our terms or applicable law we may not proactively discover such content due to scale and the limitations of existing technologies and when discovered by users such content may negatively affect our reputation our brands and user engagement regulations and other initiatives to make platforms responsible for preventing or eliminating harmful content online are gaining momentum and we expect this to continue we may be subject to enhanced regulatory oversight civil or criminal liability or reputational damage if we fail to comply with content moderation regulations adversely affecting our business and consolidated financial statements

the development of the iot presents security privacy and execution risks to support the growth of the intelligent cloud and the intelligent edge we are developing products services and technologies to power the iot a network of distributed and interconnected devices employing sensors data and computing capabilities including ai the iot’s great potential also carries substantial risks iot products and services may contain defects in design manufacture or operation that make them insecure or ineffective for their intended purposes an iot solution has multiple layers of hardware sensors processors software and firmware several of which we may not develop or control each layer including the weakest layer can impact the security of the whole system many iot devices have limited interfaces and ability to be updated or patched iot solutions may collect large amounts of data and our handling of iot data may not satisfy customers or regulatory requirements iot scenarios may increasingly affect personal health and safety if iot solutions that include our technologies do not work as intended violate the law or harm individuals or businesses we may be subject to legal claims or enforcement actions these risks if realized may increase our costs damage our reputation or brands or negatively impact our revenues or margins 

issues in the use of ai in our offerings may result in reputational harm or liability  we are building ai into many of our offerings and we expect this element of our business to grow we envision a future in which ai operating in our devices applications and the cloud helps our customers be more productive in their work and personal lives as with many disruptive innovations ai presents risks and challenges that could affect its adoption and therefore our business ai algorithms may be flawed datasets may be insufficient or contain biased information inappropriate or controversial data practices by microsoft or others could impair the acceptance of ai solutions these deficiencies could undermine the decisions predictions or analysis ai applications produce subjecting us to competitive harm legal liability and brand or reputational harm some ai scenarios present ethical issues if we enable or offer ai solutions that are controversial because of their impact on human rights privacy employment or other social issues we may experience brand or reputational harm 

operational risks 

we may have excessive outages data losses and disruptions of our online services if we fail to maintain an adequate operations infrastructure our increasing user traffic growth in services and the complexity of our products and services demand more computing power we spend substantial amounts to build purchase or lease datacenters and equipment and to upgrade our technology and network infrastructure to handle more traffic on our websites and in our datacenters these demands continue to increase as we introduce new products and services and support the growth of existing services such as bing azure microsoft account services microsoft 365 microsoft teams dynamics 365 onedrive sharepoint online skype xbox and outlookcom we are rapidly growing our business of providing a platform and backend hosting for services provided by third parties to their end users maintaining securing and expanding this infrastructure is expensive and complex and requires development of principles for datacenter builds in geographies with higher safety risks it requires that we maintain an internet connectivity infrastructure and storage and compute capacity that is robust and reliable within competitive and regulatory constraints that continue to evolve inefficiencies or operational failures including temporary or permanent loss of customer data insufficient internet connectivity or inadequate storage and compute capacity could diminish the quality of our products services and user experience resulting in contractual liability claims by customers and other third parties regulatory actions damage to our reputation and loss of current and potential users subscribers and advertisers each of which may adversely impact our consolidated financial statements 

we may experience quality or supply problems our hardware products such as xbox consoles surface devices and other devices we design and market are highly complex and can have defects in design manufacture or associated software we could incur significant expenses lost revenue and reputational harm as a result of recalls safety alerts or product liability claims if we fail to prevent detect or address such issues through design testing or warranty repairs

our software products and services also may experience quality or reliability problems the highly sophisticated software we develop may contain bugs and other defects that interfere with their intended operation our customers increasingly rely on us for critical business functions and multiple workloads many of our products and services are interdependent with one another each of these circumstances potentially magnifies the impact of quality or reliability issues any defects we do not detect and fix in prerelease testing could cause reduced sales and revenue damage to our reputation repair or remediation costs delays in the release of new products or versions or legal liability although our license agreements typically contain provisions that eliminate or limit our exposure to liability there is no assurance these provisions will withstand legal challenge 

we acquire some device and datacenter components from sole suppliers our competitors use some of the same suppliers and their demand for hardware components can affect the capacity available to us if a component from a solesource supplier is delayed or becomes unavailable whether because of supplier capacity constraint industry shortages legal or regulatory changes that restrict supply sources or other reasons we may not obtain timely replacement supplies resulting in reduced sales or inadequate datacenter capacity component shortages excess or obsolete inventory or price reductions resulting in inventory adjustments may increase our cost of revenue xbox consoles surface devices datacenter servers and other hardware are assembled in asia and other geographies that may be subject to disruptions in the supply chain resulting in shortages that would affect our revenue and operating margins these same risks would apply to any other hardware and software products we may offer 

legal regulatory and litigation risks 

government litigation and regulatory activity relating to competition rules may limit how we design and market our products as a leading global software and device maker government agencies closely scrutinize us under us and foreign competition laws governments are actively enforcing competition laws and regulations and this includes scrutiny in potentially large markets such as the european union “eu” the us and china some jurisdictions also allow competitors or consumers to assert claims of anticompetitive conduct us federal and state antitrust authorities have previously brought enforcement actions and continue to scrutinize our business 

the european commission “the commission” closely scrutinizes the design of highvolume microsoft products and the terms on which we make certain technologies used in these products such as file formats programming interfaces and protocols available to other companies flagship product releases such as windows can receive significant scrutiny under competition laws for example in 2004 the commission ordered us to create new versions of our windows operating system that do not include certain multimedia technologies and to provide our competitors with specifications for how to implement certain proprietary windows communications protocols in their own products in 2009 the commission accepted a set of commitments we offered to address the commission’s concerns relating to competition in web browsing software including an undertaking to address commission concerns relating to interoperability the web browsing commitments expired in 2014 the remaining obligations may limit our ability to innovate in windows or other products in the future diminish the developer appeal of the windows platform and increase our product development costs the availability of licenses related to protocols and file formats may enable competitors to develop software products that better mimic the functionality of our products which could hamper sales of our products 

our portfolio of firstparty devices continues to grow at the same time our oem partners offer a large variety of devices for our platforms as a result increasingly we both cooperate and compete with our oem partners creating a risk that we fail to do so in compliance with competition rules regulatory scrutiny in this area may increase certain foreign governments particularly in china and other countries in asia have advanced arguments under their competition laws that exert downward pressure on royalties for our intellectual property 

government regulatory actions and court decisions such as these may result in fines or hinder our ability to provide the benefits of our software to consumers and businesses reducing the attractiveness of our products and the revenue that come from them new competition law actions could be initiated potentially using previous actions as precedent the outcome of such actions or steps taken to avoid them could adversely affect us in a variety of ways including

our global operations subject us to potential consequences under anticorruption trade and other laws and regulations the foreign corrupt practices act “fcpa” and other anticorruption laws and regulations “anticorruption laws” prohibit corrupt payments by our employees vendors or agents and the accounting provisions of the fcpa require us to maintain accurate books and records and adequate internal controls from time to time we receive inquiries from authorities in the us and elsewhere which may be based on reports from employees and others about our business activities outside the us and our compliance with anticorruption laws periodically we receive such reports directly and investigate them on july 22 2019 our hungarian subsidiary entered into a nonprosecution agreement “npa” with the us department of justice “doj” and we agreed to the terms of a cease and desist order with the securities and exchange commission these agreements required us to pay 253 million in monetary penalties disgorgement and interest pertaining to activities at microsoft’s subsidiary in hungary the npa which has a threeyear term also contains certain ongoing compliance requirements including the obligations to disclose to the doj issues that may implicate the fcpa and to cooperate in any inquiries most countries in which we operate also have competition laws that prohibit competitors from colluding or otherwise attempting to reduce competition between themselves while we devote substantial resources to our us and international compliance programs and have implemented policies training and internal controls designed to reduce the risk of corrupt payments and collusive activity our employees vendors or agents may violate our policies our failure to comply with anticorruption laws or competition laws could result in significant fines and penalties criminal sanctions against us our officers or our employees prohibitions on the conduct of our business and damage to our reputation 

increasing trade laws policies sanctions and other regulatory requirements also affect our operations in and outside the us relating to trade and investment economic sanctions in the us the eu and other countries prohibit most business with restricted entities or countries such as crimea cuba iran north korea and syria us export controls restrict microsoft from offering many of its products and services to or making investments in certain entities in specified countries us import controls restrict us from integrating certain information and communication technologies into our supply chain and allow for government review of transactions involving information and communications technology from countries determined to be foreign adversaries noncompliance could result in reputational harm operational delays monetary fines loss of export privileges or criminal sanctions

other regulatory areas that may apply to our products and online services offerings include requirements related to user privacy telecommunications data storage and protection advertising and online content for example some regulators are taking the position that our offerings such as microsoft teams and skype are covered by existing laws regulating telecommunications services and some new laws including eu member state laws under the european electronic communications code are defining more of our services as regulated telecommunications services this trend may continue and will result in these offerings being subjected to additional data protection security and law enforcement surveillance obligations regulators may assert that our collection use and management of customer and other data is inconsistent with their laws and regulations legislative or regulatory action relating to cybersecurity requirements may increase the costs to develop implement or secure our products and services legislative and regulatory action is emerging in the areas of ai and content moderation which could increase costs or restrict opportunity applying these laws and regulations to our business is often unclear subject to change over time and sometimes may conflict from jurisdiction to jurisdiction additionally these laws and governments’ approach to their enforcement and our products and services are continuing to evolve compliance with these types of regulation may involve significant costs or require changes in products or business practices that result in reduced revenue noncompliance could result in the imposition of penalties or orders we stop the alleged noncompliant activity 

we strive to empower all people and organizations to achieve more and accessibility of our products is an important aspect of this goal there is increasing pressure from advocacy groups regulators competitors customers and other stakeholders to make technology more accessible if our products do not meet customer expectations or global accessibility requirements we could lose sales opportunities or face regulatory or legal actions

laws and regulations relating to the handling of personal data may impede the adoption of our services or result in increased costs legal claims fines against us or reputational damage  the growth of our internet and cloudbased services internationally relies increasingly on the movement of data across national boundaries legal requirements relating to the collection storage handling and transfer of personal data continue to evolve for example in july 2020 the court of justice of the eu invalidated a framework called privacy shield for companies to transfer data from eu member states to the united states this ruling has led to uncertainty about the legal requirements for data transfers from the eu under other l egal mechanisms potential new rules and restrictions on the flow of data across borders could increase the cost and complexity of delivering our products and services in some markets in may 2018 the eu general data protection regulation “gdpr” became effective the law which applies to all of our activities conducted from an establishment in the eu or related to products and services offered in the eu imposes a range of compliance obligations regarding the handling of personal data engineering efforts to build and maintain capabilities to facilitate compliance with the law have entailed substantial expense and the diversion of engineering resources from other projects and may continue to do so we might experience reduced demand for our offerings if we are unable to engineer products that meet our legal duties or help our customers meet their obligations under the gdpr or other data regulations or if our implementation to comply with the gdpr make s our offerings less attractive the gdpr imposes significant new obligations and compliance with these obligations depends in part on how particular regulators interpret and apply them if we fail to comply with the gdpr or if regulators assert we have failed to comply with the gdpr it may lead to regulatory enforcement actions which can result in monetary penalties of up to 4 of worldwide revenue private lawsuits reputational damage  and loss of customers  countries around the world and states in the us  such as california  colorado and virginia  ha ve adopted or are considering adopting or expanding  laws and regulations imposing obligations regarding the handling of personal data 

the company’s investment in gaining insights from data is becoming central to the value of the services we deliver to customers to our operational efficiency and key opportunities in monetization customer perceptions of quality and operational efficiency our ability to use data in this way may be constrained by regulatory developments that impede realizing the expected return from this investment ongoing legal analyses reviews and inquiries by regulators of microsoft practices or relevant practices of other organizations may result in burdensome or inconsistent requirements including data sovereignty and localization requirements affecting the location movement collection and use of our customer and internal employee data as well as the management of that data compliance with applicable laws and regulations regarding personal data may require changes in services business practices or internal systems that result in increased costs lower revenue reduced efficiency or greater difficulty in competing with foreignbased firms compliance with data regulations might limit our ability to innovate or offer certain features and functionality in some jurisdictions where we operate failure to comply with existing or new rules may result in significant penalties or orders to stop the alleged noncompliant activity as well as negative publicity and diversion of management time and effort 

we have claims and lawsuits against us that may result in adverse outcomes we are subject to a variety of claims and lawsuits these claims may arise from a wide variety of business practices and initiatives including major new product releases such as windows significant business transactions warranty or product claims and employment practices adverse outcomes in some or all of these claims may result in significant monetary damages or injunctive relief that could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business the litigation and other claims are subject to inherent uncertainties and management’s view of these matters may change in the future a material adverse impact in our consolidated financial statements could occur for the period in which the effect of an unfavorable outcome becomes probable and reasonably estimable 

our business with government customers may present additional uncertainties we derive substantial revenue from government contracts government contracts generally can present risks and challenges not present in private commercial agreements for instance we may be subject to government audits and investigations relating to these contracts we could be suspended or debarred as a governmental contractor we could incur civil and criminal fines and penalties and under certain circumstances contracts may be rescinded some agreements may allow a government to terminate without cause and provide for higher liability limits for certain losses some contracts may be subject to periodic funding approval reductions or delays which could adversely impact publicsector demand for our products and services these events could negatively impact our results of operations financial condition and reputation

we may have additional tax liabilities we are subject to income taxes in the us and many foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes in the course of our business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain for example compliance with the 2017 united states tax cuts and jobs act “tcja” and possible future legislative changes may require the collection of information not regularly produced within the company the use of estimates in our consolidated financial statements and the exercise of significant judgment in accounting for its provisions as regulations and guidance evolve with respect to the tcja or possible future legislative changes  and as we gather more information and perform more analysis our results may differ from previous estimates and may materially affect our consolidated financial statements 

we regularly are under audit by tax authorities in different jurisdictions although we believe that our provision for income taxes and our tax estimates are reasonable tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken in addition economic and political pressures to increase tax revenue in various jurisdictions may make resolving tax disputes favorably more difficult we are currently under internal revenue service audit for prior tax years with the primary unresolved issues relating to transfer pricing the final resolution of those audits and other audits or litigation may differ from the amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements and may materially affect our consolidated financial statements in the period or periods in which that determination is made 

we earn a significant amount of our operating income outside the us a change in the mix of earnings and losses in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in our business or structure or the expiration of or disputes about certain tax agreements in a particular country may result in higher effective tax rates for the company in addition changes in us federal and state or international tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals other fundamental law changes currently being considered by many countries including in the us and changes in taxing jurisdictions’ administrative interpretations decisions policies and positions may materially adversely impact our consolidated financial statements 

intellectual property risks 

we may not be able to protect our source code from copying if there is an unauthorized disclosure source code the detailed program commands for our operating systems and other software programs is critical to our business although we license portions of our application and operating system source code to several licensees we take significant measures to protect the secrecy of large portions of our source code if our source code leaks we might lose future trade secret protection for that code it may then become easier for third parties to compete with our products by copying functionality which could adversely affect our revenue and operating margins unauthorized disclosure of source code also could increase the security risks described elsewhere in these risk factors 

legal changes our evolving business model piracy and other factors may decrease the value of our intellectual property protecting our intellectual property rights and combating unlicensed copying and use of our software and other intellectual property on a global basis is difficult while piracy adversely affects us revenue the impact on revenue from outside the us is more significant particularly countries in which the legal system provides less protection for intellectual property rights our revenue in these markets may grow more slowly than the underlying device market similarly the absence of harmonized patent laws makes it more difficult to ensure consistent respect for patent rights throughout the world we educate users about the benefits of licensing genuine products and obtaining indemnification benefits for intellectual property risks and we educate lawmakers about the advantages of a business climate where intellectual property rights are protected reductions in the legal protection for software intellectual property rights could adversely affect revenue 

we expend significant resources to patent the intellectual property we create with the expectation that we will generate revenues by incorporating that intellectual property in our products or services or in some instances by licensing or crosslicensing our patents to others in return for a royalty andor increased freedom to operate changes in the law may continue to weaken our ability to prevent the use of patented technology or collect revenue for licensing our patents these include legislative changes and regulatory actions that make it more difficult to obtain injunctions and the increasing use of legal process to challenge issued patents similarly licensees of our patents may fail to satisfy their obligations to pay us royalties or may contest the scope and extent of their obligations the royalties we can obtain to monetize our intellectual property may decline because of the evolution of technology price changes in products using licensed patents greater value from crosslicensing or the difficulty of discovering infringements finally our increasing engagement with open source software will also cause us to license our intellectual property rights broadly in certain situations and may negatively impact revenue

part i 

item 1a

 

third parties may claim we infringe their intellectual property rights from time to time others claim we infringe their intellectual property rights the number of these claims may grow because of constant technological change in the markets in which we compete the extensive patent coverage of existing technologies the rapid rate of issuance of new patents and our offering of firstparty devices such as surface to resolve these claims we may enter into royalty and licensing agreements on terms that are less favorable than currently available stop selling or redesign affected products or services or pay damages to satisfy indemnification commitments with our customers these outcomes may cause operating margins to decline besides money damages in some jurisdictions plaintiffs can seek injunctive relief that may limit or prevent importing marketing and selling our products or services that have infringing technologies in some countries such as germany an injunction can be issued before the parties have fully litigated the validity of the underlying patents we have paid significant amounts to settle claims related to the use of technology and intellectual property rights and to procure intellectual property rights as part of our strategy to manage this risk and may continue to do so 

general risks 

if our reputation or our brands are damaged our business and operating results may be harmed  our reputation and brands are globally recognized and are important to our business our reputation and brands affect our ability to attract and retain consumer business and publicsector customers there are numerous ways our reputation or brands could be damaged these include product safety or quality issues or our environmental impact and sustainability supply chain practices or human rights record we may experience backlash from customers government entities advocacy groups employees and other stakeholders that disagree with our product offering decisions or public policy positions damage to our reputation or our brands may occur from among other things 







the proliferation of social media may increase the likelihood speed and magnitude of negative brand events if our brands or reputation are damaged it could negatively impact our revenues or margins or ability to attract the most highly qualified employees

adverse economic or market conditions may harm our business worsening economic conditions including inflation recession pandemic or other changes in economic conditions may cause lower it spending and adversely affect our revenue if demand for pcs servers and other computing devices declines or consumer or business spending for those products declines our revenue will be adversely affected 

our product distribution system relies on an extensive partner and retail network oems building devices that run our software have also been a significant means of distribution the impact of economic conditions on our partners such as the bankruptcy of a major distributor oem or retailer could cause sales channel disruption 

challenging economic conditions also may impair the ability of our customers to pay for products and services they have purchased as a result allowances for doubtful accounts and writeoffs of accounts receivable may increase 

we maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings types and maturities these investments are subject to general credit liquidity market and interest rate risks which may be exacerbated by market downturns or events that affect global financial markets a significant part of our investment portfolio comprises us government securities if global financial markets decline for long periods or if there is a downgrade of the us government credit rating due to an actual or threatened default on government debt our investment portfolio may be adversely affected and we could determine that more of our investments have experienced a decline in fair value requiring impairment charges that could adversely affect our consolidated financial statements

catastrophic events or geopolitical conditions may disrupt our business a disruption or failure of our systems or operations because of a major earthquake weather event cyberattack terrorist attack pandemic or other catastrophic event could cause delays in completing sales providing services or performing other critical functions our corporate headquarters a significant portion of our research and development activities and certain other essential business operations are in the seattle washington area and we have other business operations in the silicon valley area of california both of which are seismically active regions a catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our critical business or it systems or the infrastructure or systems they rely on such as power grids could harm our ability to conduct normal business operations providing our customers with more services and solutions in the cloud puts a premium on the resilience of our systems and strength of our business continuity management plans and magnifies the potential impact of prolonged service outages in our consolidated financial statements 

abrupt political change terrorist activity and armed conflict pose a risk of general economic disruption in affected countries which may increase our operating costs these conditions also may add uncertainty to the timing and budget for technology investment decisions by our customers and may cause supply chain disruptions for hardware manufacturers geopolitical change may result in changing regulatory systems and requirements and market interventions that could impact our operating strategies access to national regional and global markets hiring and profitability geopolitical instability may lead to sanctions and impact our ability to do business in some markets or with some publicsector customers any of these changes may negatively impact our revenues 

the occurrence of regional epidemics or a global pandemic may adversely affect our operations financial condition and results of operations the covid19 pandemic continues to have widespread rapidly evolving and unpredictable impacts on global society economies financial markets and business practices federal and state governments have implemented measures to contain the virus including social distancing travel restrictions and vaccination programs even as efforts to contain the pandemic have made progress and some restrictions have relaxed new variants of the virus are causing additional outbreaks the covid19 pandemic has impacted and may continue to impact our business operations including our employees customers partners and communities and there is substantial uncertainty in the nature and degree of its continued effects over time

the extent to which the covid19 pandemic impacts our business going forward will depend on numerous evolving factors we cannot reliably predict including the duration and scope of the pandemic governmental business and individuals actions in response to the pandemic and the impact on economic activity including the possibility of recession or financial market instability these factors may adversely impact consumer business and government spending on technology as well as customers ability to pay for our products and services on an ongoing basis this uncertainty also affects management’s accounting estimates and assumptions which could result in greater variability in a variety of areas that depend on these estimates and assumptions including investments receivables and forwardlooking guidance

measures to contain the virus that impact us our partners distributors and suppliers may further intensify these impacts and other risks described in these risk factors any of these may adversely impact our ability to













we may incur increased costs to effectively manage these aspects of our business if we are unsuccessful it may adversely impact our revenues cash flows market share growth and reputation

the longterm effects of climate change on the global economy and the it industry in particular are unclear environmental regulations or changes in the supply demand or available sources of energy or other resources may affect the availability or cost of goods and services including natural resources necessary to run our business changes in climate where we operate may increase the costs of powering and cooling computer hardware we use to develop software and provide cloudbased services 

our global business exposes us to operational and economic risks our customers are located throughout the world and a significant part of our revenue comes from international sales the global nature of our business creates operational economic and geopolitical risks our results of operations may be affected by global regional and local economic developments monetary policy inflation and recession as well as political and military disputes in addition our international growth strategy includes certain markets the developing nature of which presents several risks including deterioration of social political labor or economic conditions in a country or region and difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations emerging nationalist and protectionist trends and concerns about human rights and political expression in specific countries may significantly alter the trade and commercial environments changes to trade policy or agreements as a result of populism protectionism or economic nationalism may result in higher tariffs local sourcing initiatives and nonlocal sourcing restrictions export controls investment restrictions or other developments that make it more difficult to sell our products in foreign countries disruptions of these kinds in developed or emerging markets could negatively impact demand for our products and services or increase operating costs although we hedge a portion of our international currency exposure significant fluctuations in foreign exchange rates between the us dollar and foreign currencies may adversely affect our results of operations 

our business depends on our ability to attract and retain talented employees our business is based on successfully attracting and retaining talented employees representing diverse backgrounds experiences and skill sets the market for highly skilled workers and leaders in our industry is extremely competitive maintaining our brand and reputation as well as a diverse and inclusive work environment that enables all our employees to thrive are important to our ability to recruit and retain employees we are also limited in our ability to recruit internationally by restrictive domestic immigration laws changes to us immigration policies that restrain the flow of technical and professional talent may inhibit our ability to adequately staff our research and development efforts if we are less successful in our recruiting efforts or if we cannot retain highly skilled workers and key leaders our ability to develop and deliver successful products and services may be adversely affected effective succession planning is also important to our longterm success failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution how employmentrelated laws are interpreted and applied to our workforce practices may result in increased operating costs and less flexibility in how we meet our workforce needs

industry trends 

our industry is dynamic and highly competitive with frequent changes in both technologies and business models each industry shift is an opportunity to conceive new products new technologies or new ideas that can further transform the industry and our business at microsoft we push the boundaries of what is possible through a broad range of research and development activities that seek to identify and address the changing demands of customers and users industry trends and competitive forces

economic conditions challenges and risks

the markets for software devices and cloudbased services are dynamic and highly competitive our competitors are developing new software and devices while also deploying competing cloudbased services for consumers and businesses the devices and form factors customers prefer evolve rapidly and influence how users access services in the cloud and in some cases the user’s choice of which suite of cloudbased services to use we must continue to evolve and adapt over an extended time in pace with this changing environment the investments we are making in infrastructure and devices will continue to increase our operating costs and may decrease our operating margins

our success is highly dependent on our ability to attract and retain qualified employees we hire a mix of university and industry talent worldwide we compete for talented individuals globally by offering an exceptional working environment broad customer reach scale in resources the ability to grow one’s career across many different products and businesses and competitive compensation and benefits aggregate demand for our software services and devices is correlated to global macroeconomic and geopolitical factors which remain dynamic

our devices are primarily manufactured by thirdparty contract manufacturers some of which contain certain components for which there are very few qualified suppliers for these components we have limited nearterm flexibility to use other manufacturers if a current vendor becomes unavailable or is unable to meet our requirements extended disruptions at these suppliers could lead to a similar disruption in our ability to manufacture devices on time to meet consumer demand

our international operations provide a significant portion of our total revenue and expenses many of these revenue and expenses are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar as a result changes in foreign exchange rates may significantly affect revenue and expenses weakening of the us dollar relative to certain foreign currencies increased reported revenue and did not have a material impact on reported expenses from our international operations in fiscal year 2021

income taxes 

effective tax rate

our effective tax rate for fiscal years 2021 and 2020 was 14 and 17 respectively the decrease in our effective tax rate was primarily due to tax benefits from a decision by the india supreme court on withholding taxes in the case of engineering analysis centre of excellence private limited vs the commissioner of income tax an agreement between the us and india tax authorities related to transfer pricing final tax cuts and jobs act “tcja” regulations and an increase in tax benefits relating to stockbased compensation

we have historically paid india withholding taxes on software sales through distributor withholding and tax audit assessments in india in march 2021 the india supreme court ruled favorably for companies in 86 separate appeals some dating back to 2012 holding that software sales are not subject to india withholding taxes although we were not a party to the appeals our software sales in india were determined to be not subject to withholding taxes therefore we recorded a net income tax benefit of 620 million in the third quarter of fiscal year 2021 to reflect the results of the india supreme court decision impacting fiscal year 1996 through fiscal year 2016

our effective tax rate was lower than the us federal statutory rate primarily due to earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting from producing and distributing our products and services through our foreign regional operations centers in ireland and puerto rico tax benefits relating to stockbased compensation and tax benefits from the india supreme court decision on withholding taxes 

the mix of income before income taxes between the us and foreign countries impacted our effective tax rate as a result of the geographic distribution of and customer demand for our products and services in fiscal year 2021 our us income before income taxes was 350 billion and our foreign income before income taxes was 361 billion in fiscal year 2020 our us income before income taxes was 241 billion and our foreign income before income taxes was 289 billion

uncertain tax positions

we settled a portion of the internal revenue service “irs” audit for tax years 2004 to 2006 in fiscal year 2011 in february 2012 the irs withdrew its 2011 revenue agents report related to unresolved issues for tax years 2004 to 2006 and reopened the audit phase of the examination we also settled a portion of the irs audit for tax years 2007 to 2009 in fiscal year 2016 and a portion of the irs audit for tax years 2010 to 2013 in fiscal year 2018 in the second quarter of fiscal year 2021 we settled an additional portion of the irs audits for tax years 2004 to 2013 and made a payment of 17 billion including tax and interest we remain under audit for tax years 2004 to 2017 

part ii 

item 7

 

as of june 30 202 1  the primary unresolved issues for the irs audits relate to transfer pricing which could have a material impact in our consolidated financial statements when the matters are resolved we believe our allowances for income tax contingencies are adequate we have not received a proposed assessment for the unresolved key transfer pricing issues and do not expect a final resolution of these issues in the next 12 months based on the information currently available we do not anticipate a significant increase or decrease to our tax contingencies for these issues within the next 12 months 

we are subject to income tax in many jurisdictions outside the us our operations in certain jurisdictions remain subject to examination for tax years 1996 to 2020 some of which are currently under audit by local tax authorities the resolution of each of these audits is not expected to be material to our consolidated financial statements

nongaap financial measures 

adjusted net income and adjusted diluted eps are nongaap financial measures which exclude the tax benefits related to the india supreme court decision on withholding taxes in fiscal year 2021 we believe these nongaap measures aid investors by providing additional insight into our operational performance and help clarify trends affecting our business for comparability of reporting management considers nongaap measures in conjunction with gaap financial results in evaluating business performance these nongaap financial measures presented should not be considered a substitute for or superior to the measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with gaap

cash cash equivalents and investments 

cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments totaled 1303 billion and 1365 billion as of june 30 2021 and 2020 equity investments were 60 billion and 30 billion as of june 30 2021 and 2020 respectively our shortterm investments are primarily intended to facilitate liquidity and capital preservation they consist predominantly of highly liquid investmentgrade fixedincome securities diversified among industries and individual issuers the investments are predominantly us dollardenominated securities but also include foreign currencydenominated securities to diversify risk our fixedincome investments are exposed to interest rate risk and credit risk the credit risk and average maturity of our fixedincome portfolio are managed to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain fixedincome indices the settlement risk related to these investments is insignificant given that the shortterm investments held are primarily highly liquid investmentgrade fixedincome securities 

valuation 

in general and where applicable we use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities to determine the fair value of our financial instruments this pricing methodology applies to our level 1 investments such as us government securities common and preferred stock and mutual funds if quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities are not available to determine fair value then we use quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities or inputs other than the quoted prices that are observable either directly or indirectly this pricing methodology applies to our level 2 investments such as commercial paper certificates of deposit us agency securities foreign government bonds mortgage and assetbacked securities corporate notes and bonds and municipal securities level 3 investments are valued using internallydeveloped models with unobservable inputs assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis using unobservable inputs are an immaterial portion of our portfolio 

a majority of our investments are priced by pricing vendors and are generally level 1 or level 2 investments as these vendors either provide a quoted market price in an active market or use observable inputs for their pricing without applying significant adjustments broker pricing is used mainly when a quoted price is not available the investment is not priced by our pricing vendors or when a broker price is more reflective of fair values in the market in which the investment trades our brokerpriced investments are generally classified as level 2 investments because the broker prices these investments based on similar assets without applying significant adjustments in addition all our brokerpriced investments have a sufficient level of trading volume to demonstrate that the fair values used are appropriate for these investments our fair value processes include controls that are designed to ensure appropriate fair values are recorded these controls include model validation review of key model inputs analysis of periodoverperiod fluctuations and independent recalculation of prices where appropriate 

cash flows 

cash from operations increased 161 billion to 767 billion for fiscal year 2021 mainly due to an increase in cash received from customers offset in part by an increase in cash paid to suppliers and employees cash used in financing increased 25 billion to 485 billion for fiscal year 2021 mainly due to a 44 billion increase in common stock repurchases and a 14 billion increase in dividends paid offset in part by a 18 billion decrease in repayments of debt and a 17 billion decrease in cash premium paid on debt exchange cash used in investing increased 154 billion to 276 billion for fiscal year 2021 mainly due to a 64 billion increase in cash used for acquisitions of companies net of cash acquired and purchases of intangible and other assets a 52 billion increase in additions to property and equipment and a 41 billion decrease in cash from net investment purchases sales and maturities

debt 

we issue debt to take advantage of favorable pricing and liquidity in the debt markets reflecting our credit rating and the low interest rate environment the proceeds of these issuances were or will be used for general corporate purposes which may include among other things funding for working capital capital expenditures repurchases of capital stock acquisitions and repayment of existing debt in march 2021 and june 2020 we exchanged a portion of our existing debt at a premium for cash and new debt with longer maturities to take advantage of favorable financing rates in the debt markets reflecting our credit rating and the low interest rate environment refer to note 11 – debt of the notes to financial statements part ii item 8 of this form 10k for further discussion

share repurchases 

during fiscal years 2021 and 2020 we repurchased 101 million shares and 126 million shares of our common stock for 230 billion and 197 billion respectively through our share repurchase programs all repurchases were made using cash resources refer to note 16 – stockholders’ equity of the notes to financial statements part ii item 8 of this form 10k for further discussion

on april 11 2021 we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire nuance communications inc “nuance” for 5600 per share in an allcash transaction valued at 197 billion inclusive of nuance’s net debt the acquisition has been approved by nuance’s shareholders and we expect it to close by the end of calendar year 2021 subject to the satisfaction of certain regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions

we will continue to invest in sales marketing product support infrastructure and existing and advanced areas of technology as well as continue making acquisitions that align with our business strategy additions to property and equipment will continue including new facilities datacenters and computer systems for research and development sales and marketing support and administrative staff we expect capital expenditures to increase in coming years to support growth in our cloud offerings we have operating and finance leases for datacenters corporate offices research and development facilities microsoft experience centers and certain equipment we have not engaged in any related party transactions or arrangements with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect liquidity or the availability of capital resources 

liquidity

as a result of the tcja we are required to pay a onetime transition tax on deferred foreign income not previously subject to us income tax under the tcja the transition tax is payable in interestfree installments over eight years with 8 due in each of the first five years 15 in year six 20 in year seven and 25 in year eight we have paid transition tax of 47 billion which included 15 billion for fiscal year 2021 the remaining transition tax of 136 billion is payable over the next five years with a final payment in fiscal year 2026 

we expect existing cash cash equivalents shortterm investments cash flows from operations and access to capital markets to continue to be sufficient to fund our operating activities and cash commitments for investing and financing activities such as dividends share repurchases debt maturities material capital expenditures and the transition tax related to the tcja for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future

recent accounting guidance 

refer to note 1 – accounting policies of the notes to financial statements part ii item 8 of this form 10k for further discussion

application of critical accounting policies 

our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with gaap preparing consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses these estimates and assumptions are affected by management’s application of accounting policies as well as uncertainty in the current economic environment due to covid19 critical accounting policies for us include revenue recognition impairment of investment securities goodwill research and development costs contingencies income taxes and inventories 

revenue recognition 

our contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer determining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together may require significant judgment when a cloudbased service includes both onpremises software licenses and cloud services judgment is required to determine whether the software license is considered distinct and accounted for separately or not distinct and accounted for together with the cloud service and recognized over time certain cloud services primarily office 365 depend on a significant level of integration interdependency and interrelation between the desktop applications and cloud services and are accounted for together as one performance obligation revenue from office 365 is recognized ratably over the period in which the cloud services are provided 

judgment is required to determine the standalone selling price “ssp for each distinct performance obligation we use a single amount to estimate ssp for items that are not sold separately including onpremises licenses sold with sa or software updates provided at no additional charge we use a range of amounts to estimate ssp when we sell each of the products and services separately and need to determine whether there is a discount to be allocated based on the relative ssp of the various products and services 

in instances where ssp is not directly observable such as when we do not sell the product or service separately we determine the ssp using information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs we typically have more than one ssp for individual products and services due to the stratification of those products and services by customers and circumstances in these instances we may use information such as the size of the customer and geographic region in determining the ssp 

due to the various benefits from and the nature of our sa program judgment is required to assess the pattern of delivery including the exercise pattern of certain benefits across our portfolio of customers 

our products are generally sold with a right of return we may provide other credits or incentives and in certain instances we estimate customer usage of our products and services which are accounted for as variable consideration when determining the amount of revenue to recognize returns and credits are estimated at contract inception and updated at the end of each reporting period if additional information becomes available changes to our estimated variable consideration were not material for the periods presented 

impairment of investment securities 

we review debt investments quarterly for credit losses and impairment if the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value we evaluate among other factors general market conditions credit quality of debt instrument issuers and the extent to which the fair value is less than cost this determination requires significant judgment in making this judgment we employ a systematic methodology that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments in addition we consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the investee if we have plans to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery then a decline in fair value below cost is recorded as an impairment charge in other income expense net and a new cost basis in the investment is established if market industry andor investee conditions deteriorate we may incur future impairments 

part ii 

item 7

 

equity investments without readily determinable fair values are written down to fair value if a qualitative assessment indicates that the investment is impaired and the fair value of the investment is less than carrying value we perform a qualitative assessment on a periodic basis we are required to estimate the fair value of the investment to determine the amount of the impairment loss once an investment is determined to be impaired an impairment charge is recorded in other income expense net 

goodwill 

we allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the business combination we evaluate our reporting units on an annual basis and if necessary reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level operating segment or one level below an operating segment on an annual basis may 1 for us and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value these events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate legal factors operating performance indicators competition or sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit 

application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment including the identification of reporting units assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units assignment of goodwill to reporting units and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit the fair value of each reporting unit is estimated primarily through the use of a discounted cash flow methodology this analysis requires significant judgments including estimation of future cash flows which is dependent on internal forecasts estimation of the longterm rate of growth for our business estimation of the useful life over which cash flows will occur and determination of our weighted average cost of capital 

the estimates used to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit change from year to year based on operating results market conditions and other factors changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and goodwill impairment for each reporting unit 

research and development costs 

costs incurred internally in researching and developing a computer software product are charged to expense until technological feasibility has been established for the product once technological feasibility is established software costs are capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers judgment is required in determining when technological feasibility of a product is established we have determined that technological feasibility for our software products is reached after all highrisk development issues have been resolved through coding and testing generally this occurs shortly before the products are released to production the amortization of these costs is included in cost of revenue over the estimated life of the products 

legal and other contingencies 

the outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought against us are subject to significant uncertainty an estimated loss from a loss contingency such as a legal proceeding or claim is accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated in determining whether a loss should be accrued we evaluate among other factors the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss changes in these factors could materially impact our consolidated financial statements

income taxes 

the objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity’s financial statements or tax returns we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement accounting literature also provides guidance on derecognition of income tax assets and liabilities classification of deferred income tax assets and liabilities accounting for interest and penalties associated with tax positions and income tax disclosures judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our consolidated financial statements

research and development 

product and service development and intellectual property 

we develop most of our products and services internally through the following engineering groups 











part i 

item 1

 

internal development allows us to maintain competitive advantages that come from product differentiation and closer technical control over our products and services it also gives us the freedom to decide which modifications and enhancements are most important and when they should be implemented we strive to obtain information as early as possible about changing usage patterns and hardware advances that may affect software and hardware design before releasing new software platforms and as we make significant modifications to existing platforms we provide application vendors with a range of resources and guidelines for development training and testing generally we also create product documentation internally 

we protect our intellectual property investments in a variety of ways we work actively in the us and internationally to ensure the enforcement of copyright trademark trade secret and other protections that apply to our software and hardware products services business plans and branding we are a leader among technology companies in pursuing patents and currently have a portfolio of over 63000 us and international patents issued and over 24500 pending worldwide while we employ much of our internallydeveloped intellectual property exclusively in our products and services we also engage in outbound licensing of specific patented technologies that are incorporated into licensees’ products from time to time we enter into broader crosslicense agreements with other technology companies covering entire groups of patents we also purchase or license technology that we incorporate into our products and services at times we make select intellectual property broadly available at no or low cost to achieve a strategic objective such as promoting industry standards advancing interoperability or attracting and enabling our external development community our increasing engagement with open source software will also cause us to license our intellectual property rights broadly in certain situations

while it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of our products services and business methods we believe based upon past experience and industry practice such licenses generally can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms we believe our continuing research and product development are not materially dependent on any single license or other agreement with a third party relating to the development of our products 

investing in the future 

our success is based on our ability to create new and compelling products services and experiences for our users to initiate and embrace disruptive technology trends to enter new geographic and product markets and to drive broad adoption of our products and services we invest in a range of emerging technology trends and breakthroughs that we believe offer significant opportunities to deliver value to our customers and growth for the company based on our assessment of key technology trends we maintain our longterm commitment to research and development across a wide spectrum of technologies tools and platforms spanning digital work and life experiences cloud computing ai devices and operating systems 

while our main product research and development facilities are located in redmond washington we also operate research and development facilities in other parts of the us and around the world including canada china czech republic india ireland israel and the united kingdom this global approach helps us remain competitive in local markets and enables us to continue to attract top talent from across the world

 item 1a risk factors 

our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties including those described below that could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations cash flows and the trading price of our common stock

we face intense competition across all markets for our products and services which may lead to lower revenue or operating margins 

competition in the technology sector

our competitors range in size from diversified global companies with significant research and development resources to small specialized firms whose narrower product lines may let them be more effective in deploying technical marketing and financial resources barriers to entry in many of our businesses are low and many of the areas in which we compete evolve rapidly with changing and disruptive technologies shifting user needs and frequent introductions of new products and services our ability to remain competitive depends on our success in making innovative products devices and services that appeal to businesses and consumers 

competition among platformbased ecosystems

an important element of our business model has been to create platformbased ecosystems on which many participants can build diverse solutions a wellestablished ecosystem creates beneficial network effects among users application developers and the platform provider that can accelerate growth establishing significant scale in the marketplace is necessary to achieve and maintain attractive margins we face significant competition from firms that provide competing platforms

business model competition 

companies compete with us based on a growing variety of business models 







the competitive pressures described above may cause decreased sales volumes price reductions andor increased operating costs such as for research and development marketing and sales incentives this may lead to lower revenue gross margins and operating income 

our increasing focus on cloudbased services presents execution and competitive risks a growing part of our business involves cloudbased services available across the spectrum of computing devices our strategic vision is to compete and grow by building bestinclass platforms and productivity services for an intelligent cloud and an intelligent edge infused with artificial intelligence “ai” at the same time our competitors are rapidly developing and deploying cloudbased services for consumers and business customers pricing and delivery models are evolving devices and form factors influence how users access services in the cloud and sometimes the user’s choice of which cloudbased services to use we are devoting significant resources to develop and deploy our cloudbased strategies the windows ecosystem must continue to evolve with this changing environment we are undertaking cultural and organizational changes to drive accountability and eliminate obstacles to innovation our intelligent cloud and intelligent edge worldview is connected with the growth of the internet of things “iot” our success in the iot will depend on the level of adoption of our offerings such as azure azure stack azure iot edge and azure sphere we may not establish market share sufficient to achieve scale necessary to achieve our business objectives 

besides software development costs we are incurring costs to build and maintain infrastructure to support cloud computing services these costs will reduce the operating margins we have previously achieved whether we succeed in cloudbased services depends on our execution in several areas including 











it is uncertain whether our strategies will attract the users or generate the revenue required to succeed if we are not effective in executing organizational and technical changes to increase efficiency and accelerate innovation or if we fail to generate sufficient usage of our new products and services we may not grow revenue in line with the infrastructure and development investments described above this may negatively impact gross margins and operating income

we make significant investments in products and services that may not achieve expected returns we will continue to make significant investments in research development and marketing for existing products services and technologies including the windows operating system microsoft 365 office bing sql server windows server azure office 365 xbox live linkedin and other products and services we also invest in the development and acquisition of a variety of hardware for productivity communication and entertainment including pcs tablets gaming devices and hololens investments in new technology are speculative commercial success depends on many factors including innovativeness developer support and effective distribution and marketing if customers do not perceive our latest offerings as providing significant new functionality or other value they may reduce their purchases of new software and hardware products or upgrades unfavorably affecting revenue we may not achieve significant revenue from new product service and distribution channel investments for several years if at all new products and services may not be profitable and even if they are profitable operating margins for some new products and businesses will not be as high as the margins we have experienced historically we may not get engagement in certain features like edge and bing that drive postsale monetization opportunities our data handling practices across our products and services will continue to be under scrutiny and perceptions of mismanagement driven by regulatory activity or negative public reaction to our practices or product experiences which could negatively impact product and feature adoption product design and product quality 

developing new technologies is complex it can require long development and testing periods significant delays in new releases or significant problems in creating new products or services could adversely affect our revenue 

acquisitions joint ventures and strategic alliances may have an adverse effect on our business we expect to continue making acquisitions and entering into joint ventures and strategic alliances as part of our longterm business strategy for example in october 2018 we completed our acquisition of github inc “github” for 75 billion these acquisitions and other transactions and arrangements involve significant challenges and risks including that they do not advance our business strategy that we get an unsatisfactory return on our investment that we have difficulty integrating and retaining new employees business systems and technology or that they distract management from our other businesses if an arrangement fails to adequately anticipate changing circumstances and interests of a party it may result in early termination or renegotiation of the arrangement the success of these transactions and arrangements will depend in part on our ability to leverage them to enhance our existing products and services or develop compelling new ones it may take longer than expected to realize the full benefits from these transactions and arrangements such as increased revenue or enhanced efficiencies or the benefits may ultimately be smaller than we expected these events could adversely affect our consolidated financial statements 

if our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets become impaired we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings we acquire other companies and intangible assets and may not realize all the economic benefit from those acquisitions which could cause an impairment of goodwill or intangibles we review our amortizable intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable we test goodwill for impairment at least annually factors that may be a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets may not be recoverable include a decline in our stock price and market capitalization reduced future cash flow estimates and slower growth rates in industry segments in which we participate we have in the past recorded and may in the future be required to record a significant charge in our consolidated financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets is determined negatively affecting our results of operations

cyberattacks and security vulnerabilities could lead to reduced revenue increased costs liability claims or harm to our reputation or competitive position 

security of our information technology 

threats to it security can take a variety of forms individual and groups of hackers and sophisticated organizations including statesponsored organizations or nationstates continuously undertake attacks that pose threats to our customers and our it these actors may use a wide variety of methods which may include developing and deploying malicious software or exploiting vulnerabilities in hardware software or other infrastructure in order to attack our products and services or gain access to our networks and datacenters using social engineering techniques to induce our employees users partners or customers to disclose passwords or other sensitive information or take other actions to gain access to our data or our users’ or customers’ data or acting in a coordinated manner to launch distributed denial of service or other coordinated attacks inadequate account security practices may also result in unauthorized access to confidential data for example system administrators may fail to timely remove employee account access when no longer appropriate employees or third parties may intentionally compromise our or our users’ security or systems or reveal confidential information

cyberthreats are constantly evolving increasing the difficulty of detecting and successfully defending against them we may have no current capability to detect certain vulnerabilities which may allow them to persist in the environment over long periods of time cyberthreats can have cascading impacts that unfold with increasing speed across our internal networks and systems and those of our partners and customers breaches of our facilities network or data security could disrupt the security of our systems and business applications impair our ability to provide services to our customers and protect the privacy of their data result in product development delays compromise confidential or technical business information harming our reputation or competitive position result in theft or misuse of our intellectual property or other assets require us to allocate more resources to improve technologies or otherwise adversely affect our business

in addition our internal it environment continues to evolve often we are early adopters of new devices and technologies we embrace new ways of sharing data and communicating internally and with partners and customers using methods such as social networking and other consumeroriented technologies our business policies and internal security controls may not keep pace with these changes as new threats emerge

security of our products services devices and customers’ data

the security of our products and services is important in our customers’ decisions to purchase or use our products or services security threats are a significant challenge to companies like us whose business is providing technology products and services to others threats to our own it infrastructure can also affect our customers customers using our cloudbased services rely on the security of our infrastructure including hardware and other elements provided by third parties to ensure the reliability of our services and the protection of their data adversaries tend to focus their efforts on the most popular operating systems programs and services including many of ours and we expect that to continue adversaries that acquire user account information at other companies can use that information to compromise our users’ accounts where accounts share the same attributes as passwords inadequate account security practices may also result in unauthorized access user activity may also result in ransomware or other malicious software impacting a customer’s use of our products or services we are also increasingly incorporating open source software into our products there may be vulnerabilities in open source software that may make our products susceptible to cyberattacks

to defend against security threats to our internal it systems our cloudbased services and our customers’ systems we must continuously engineer more secure products and services enhance security and reliability features improve the deployment of software updates to address security vulnerabilities in our own products as well as those provided by others develop mitigation technologies that help to secure customers from attacks even when software updates are not deployed maintain the digital security infrastructure that protects the integrity of our network products and services and provide security tools such as firewalls and antivirus software and information about the need to deploy security measures and the impact of doing so customers in certain industries such as financial services health care and government may have enhanced or specialized requirements to which we must engineer our product and services

the cost of these steps could reduce our operating margins if we fail to do these things well actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products and services data corruption issues or reduced performance could harm our reputation and lead customers to reduce or delay future purchases of products or subscriptions to services or to use competing products or services customers may also spend more on protecting their existing computer systems from attack which could delay adoption of additional products or services customers and third parties granted access to their systems may fail to update their systems continue to run software or operating systems we no longer support or may fail timely to install or enable security patches or may otherwise fail to adopt adequate security practices any of these could adversely affect our reputation and revenue actual or perceived vulnerabilities may lead to claims against us our license agreements typically contain provisions that eliminate or limit our exposure to liability but there is no assurance these provisions will withstand legal challenges at times to achieve commercial objectives we may enter into agreements with larger liability exposure to customers 

our products operate in conjunction with and are dependent on products and components across a broad ecosystem of third parties if there is a security vulnerability in one of these components and if there is a security exploit targeting it we could face increased costs liability claims reduced revenue or harm to our reputation or competitive position

disclosure and misuse of personal data could result in liability and harm our reputation as we continue to grow the number and scale of our cloudbased offerings we store and process increasingly large amounts of personally identifiable information of our customers and users the continued occurrence of highprofile data breaches provides evidence of an external environment increasingly hostile to information security despite our efforts to improve the security controls across our business groups and geographies it is possible our security controls over personal data our training of employees and third parties on data security and other practices we follow may not prevent the improper disclosure or misuse of customer or user data we or our vendors store and manage in addition third parties who have limited access to our customer or user data may use this data in unauthorized ways improper disclosure or misuse could harm our reputation lead to legal exposure to customers or users or subject us to liability under laws that protect personal data resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue our software products and services also enable our customers and users to store and process personal data onpremises or increasingly in a cloudbased environment we host government authorities can sometimes require us to produce customer or user data in response to valid legal orders in the us and elsewhere we advocate for transparency concerning these requests and appropriate limitations on government authority to compel disclosure despite our efforts to protect customer and user data perceptions that the collection use and retention of personal information is not satisfactorily protected could inhibit sales of our products or services and could limit adoption of our cloudbased solutions by consumers businesses and government entities additional security measures we may take to address customer or user concerns or constraints on our flexibility to determine where and how to operate datacenters in response to customer or user expectations or governmental rules or actions may cause higher operating expenses or hinder growth of our products and services 

we may not be able to protect information in our products and services from use by others  linkedin and other microsoft products and services contain valuable information and content protected by contractual restrictions or technical measures in certain cases we have made commitments to our members and users to limit access to or use of this information changes in the law or interpretations of the law may weaken our ability to prevent third parties from scraping or gathering information or content through use of bots or other measures and using it for their own benefit thus diminishing the value of our products and services 

abuse of our platforms may harm our reputation or user engagement 

advertising professional and social platform abuses 

for platform products and services that provide content or host ads that come from or can be influenced by third parties including github linkedin microsoft advertising msn and xbox live our reputation or user engagement may be negatively affected by activity that is hostile or inappropriate this activity may come from users impersonating other people or organizations use of our products or services to spread terrorist or violent extremist content or to disseminate information that may be viewed as misleading or intended to manipulate the opinions of our users or the use of our products or services that violates our terms of service or otherwise for objectionable or illegal ends preventing or responding to these actions may require us to make substantial investments in people and technology and these investments may not be successful adversely affecting our business and consolidated financial statements

digital safety and service misuse 

our hosted consumer services as well as our enterprise services may be used by third parties to disseminate harmful or illegal content in violation of our terms or applicable law we may not proactively discover such content due to scale and the limitations of existing technologies and when discovered by users such content may negatively affect our reputation our brands and user engagement regulations and other initiatives to make platforms responsible for preventing or eliminating harmful content online are gaining momentum and we expect this to continue we may be subject to enhanced regulatory oversight civil or criminal liability or reputational damage if we fail to comply with content moderation regulations adversely affecting our business and consolidated financial statements

the development of the iot presents security privacy and execution risks to support the growth of the intelligent cloud and the intelligent edge we are developing products services and technologies to power the iot a network of distributed and interconnected devices employing sensors data and computing capabilities including ai the iot’s great potential also carries substantial risks iot products and services may contain defects in design manufacture or operation that make them insecure or ineffective for their intended purposes an iot solution has multiple layers of hardware sensors processors software and firmware several of which we may not develop or control each layer including the weakest layer can impact the security of the whole system many iot devices have limited interfaces and ability to be updated or patched iot solutions may collect large amounts of data and our handling of iot data may not satisfy customers or regulatory requirements iot scenarios may increasingly affect personal health and safety if iot solutions that include our technologies do not work as intended violate the law or harm individuals or businesses we may be subject to legal claims or enforcement actions these risks if realized may increase our costs damage our reputation or brands or negatively impact our revenues or margins 

issues in the use of ai in our offerings may result in reputational harm or liability  we are building ai into many of our offerings and we expect this element of our business to grow we envision a future in which ai operating in our devices applications and the cloud helps our customers be more productive in their work and personal lives as with many disruptive innovations ai presents risks and challenges that could affect its adoption and therefore our business ai algorithms may be flawed datasets may be insufficient or contain biased information inappropriate or controversial data practices by microsoft or others could impair the acceptance of ai solutions these deficiencies could undermine the decisions predictions or analysis ai applications produce subjecting us to competitive harm legal liability and brand or reputational harm some ai scenarios present ethical issues if we enable or offer ai solutions that are controversial because of their impact on human rights privacy employment or other social issues we may experience brand or reputational harm 

we may have excessive outages data losses and disruptions of our online services if we fail to maintain an adequate operations infrastructure our increasing user traffic growth in services and the complexity of our products and services demand more computing power we spend substantial amounts to build purchase or lease datacenters and equipment and to upgrade our technology and network infrastructure to handle more traffic on our websites and in our datacenters these demands continue to increase as we introduce new products and services and support the growth of existing services such as bing azure microsoft account services office 365 microsoft teams dynamics 365 onedrive sharepoint online skype xbox live and outlookcom we are rapidly growing our business of providing a platform and backend hosting for services provided by third parties to their end users maintaining securing and expanding this infrastructure is expensive and complex and requires development of principles for datacenter builds in geographies with higher safety risks it requires that we maintain an internet connectivity infrastructure and storage and compute capacity that is robust and reliable within competitive and regulatory constraints that continue to evolve inefficiencies or operational failures including temporary or permanent loss of customer data insufficient internet connectivity or inadequate storage and compute capacity could diminish the quality of our products services and user experience resulting in contractual liability claims by customers and other third parties regulatory actions damage to our reputation and loss of current and potential users subscribers and advertisers each of which may adversely impact our consolidated financial statements 

we may experience quality or supply problems our hardware products such as xbox consoles surface devices and other devices we design manufacture and market are highly complex and can have defects in design manufacture or associated software we could incur significant expenses lost revenue and reputational harm as a result of recalls safety alerts or product liability claims if we fail to prevent detect or address such issues through design testing or warranty repairs 

part i 

item 1a

 

our software products and services also may experience quality or reliability problems the highly sophisticated software we develop may contain bugs and other defects that interfere with their intended operation our customers increasingly rely on us for critical functions potentially magnifying the impact of quality or reliability issues any defects we do not detect and fix in prerelease testing could cause reduced sales and revenue damage to our reputation repair or remediation costs delays in the release of new products or versions or legal liability although our license agreements typically contain provisions that eliminate or limit our exposure to liability there is no assurance these provisions will withstand legal challenge 

we acquire some device and datacenter components from sole suppliers our competitors use some of the same suppliers and their demand for hardware components can affect the capacity available to us if a component from a solesource supplier is delayed or becomes unavailable whether because of supplier capacity constraint industry shortages legal or regulatory changes or other reasons we may not obtain timely replacement supplies resulting in reduced sales or inadequate datacenter capacity component shortages excess or obsolete inventory or price reductions resulting in inventory adjustments may increase our cost of revenue xbox consoles surface devices datacenter servers and other hardware are assembled in asia and other geographies that may be subject to disruptions in the supply chain resulting in shortages that would affect our revenue and operating margins these same risks would apply to any other hardware and software products we may offer 

we may not be able to protect our source code from copying if there is an unauthorized disclosure source code the detailed program commands for our operating systems and other software programs is critical to our business although we license portions of our application and operating system source code to several licensees we take significant measures to protect the secrecy of large portions of our source code if our source code leaks we might lose future trade secret protection for that code it may then become easier for third parties to compete with our products by copying functionality which could adversely affect our revenue and operating margins unauthorized disclosure of source code also could increase the security risks described elsewhere in these risk factors 

legal changes our evolving business model piracy and other factors may decrease the value of our intellectual property protecting our intellectual property rights and combating unlicensed copying and use of our software and other intellectual property on a global basis is difficult while piracy adversely affects us revenue the impact on revenue from outside the us is more significant particularly countries in which the legal system provides less protection for intellectual property rights our revenue in these markets may grow more slowly than the underlying device market similarly the absence of harmonized patent laws makes it more difficult to ensure consistent respect for patent rights throughout the world we educate users about the benefits of licensing genuine products and obtaining indemnification benefits for intellectual property risks and we educate lawmakers about the advantages of a business climate where intellectual property rights are protected reductions in the legal protection for software intellectual property rights could adversely affect revenue 

we expend significant resources to patent the intellectual property we create with the expectation that we will generate revenues by incorporating that intellectual property in our products or services or in some instances by licensing our patents to others in return for a royalty changes in the law may continue to weaken our ability to prevent the use of patented technology or collect revenue for licensing our patents these include legislative changes and regulatory actions that make it more difficult to obtain injunctions and the increasing use of legal process to challenge issued patents similarly licensees of our patents may fail to satisfy their obligations to pay us royalties or may contest the scope and extent of their obligations the royalties we can obtain to monetize our intellectual property may decline because of the evolution of technology selling price changes in products using licensed patents or the difficulty of discovering infringements finally our increasing engagement with open source software will also cause us to license our intellectual property rights broadly in certain situations and may negatively impact revenue

part i 

item 1a

 

third parties may claim we infringe their intellectual property rights from time to time others claim we infringe their intellectual property rights the number of these claims may grow because of constant technological change in the markets in which we compete the extensive patent coverage of existing technologies the rapid rate of issuance of new patents and our offering of firstparty devices such as surface to resolve these claims we may enter into royalty and licensing agreements on terms that are less favorable than currently available stop selling or redesign affected products or services or pay damages to satisfy indemnification commitments with our customers these outcomes may cause operating margins to decline besides money damages in some jurisdictions plaintiffs can seek injunctive relief that may limit or prevent importing marketing and selling our products or services that have infringing technologies in some countries such as germany an injunction can be issued before the parties have fully litigated the validity of the underlying patents we have paid significant amounts to settle claims related to the use of technology and intellectual property rights and to procure intellectual property rights as part of our strategy to manage this risk and may continue to do so 

we have claims and lawsuits against us that may result in adverse outcomes we are subject to a variety of claims and lawsuits these claims may arise from a wide variety of business practices and initiatives including major new product releases such as windows 10 significant business transactions warranty or product claims and employment practices adverse outcomes in some or all of these claims may result in significant monetary damages or injunctive relief that could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business the litigation and other claims are subject to inherent uncertainties and management’s view of these matters may change in the future a material adverse impact in our consolidated financial statements could occur for the period in which the effect of an unfavorable outcome becomes probable and reasonably estimable 

government litigation and regulatory activity relating to competition rules may limit how we design and market our products as a leading global software and device maker government agencies closely scrutinize us under us and foreign competition laws governments are actively enforcing competition laws and regulations and this includes scrutiny in potentially large markets such as the european union “eu” the us and china some jurisdictions also allow competitors or consumers to assert claims of anticompetitive conduct us federal and state antitrust authorities have previously brought enforcement actions and continue to scrutinize our business 

the european commission “the commission” closely scrutinizes the design of highvolume microsoft products and the terms on which we make certain technologies used in these products such as file formats programming interfaces and protocols available to other companies flagship product releases such as windows 10 can receive significant scrutiny under competition laws for example in 2004 the commission ordered us to create new versions of our windows operating system that do not include certain multimedia technologies and to provide our competitors with specifications for how to implement certain proprietary windows communications protocols in their own products in 2009 the commission accepted a set of commitments we offered to address the commission’s concerns relating to competition in web browsing software including an undertaking to address commission concerns relating to interoperability the web browsing commitments expired in 2014 the remaining obligations may limit our ability to innovate in windows or other products in the future diminish the developer appeal of the windows platform and increase our product development costs the availability of licenses related to protocols and file formats may enable competitors to develop software products that better mimic the functionality of our products which could hamper sales of our products 

our portfolio of firstparty devices continues to grow at the same time our oem partners offer a large variety of devices for our platforms as a result increasingly we both cooperate and compete with our oem partners creating a risk that we fail to do so in compliance with competition rules regulatory scrutiny in this area may increase certain foreign governments particularly in china and other countries in asia have advanced arguments under their competition laws that exert downward pressure on royalties for our intellectual property 

government regulatory actions and court decisions such as these may result in fines or hinder our ability to provide the benefits of our software to consumers and businesses reducing the attractiveness of our products and the revenue that come from them new competition law actions could be initiated potentially using previous actions as precedent the outcome of such actions or steps taken to avoid them could adversely affect us in a variety of ways including

our global operations subject us to potential liability under anticorruption trade protection and other laws and regulations the foreign corrupt practices act “fcpa” and other anticorruption laws and regulations “anticorruption laws” prohibit corrupt payments by our employees vendors or agents and the accounting provisions of the fcpa require us to maintain accurate books and records and adequate internal controls from time to time we receive inquiries from authorities in the us and elsewhere which may be based on reports from employees and others about our business activities outside the us and our compliance with anticorruption laws periodically we receive such reports directly and investigate them on july 22 2019 our hungarian subsidiary entered into a nonprosecution agreement “npa” with the us department of justice “doj” and we agreed to the terms of a cease and desist order with the securities and exchange commission these agreements required us to pay 253 million in monetary penalties disgorgement and interest pertaining to activities at microsoft’s subsidiary in hungary the npa which has a threeyear term also contains certain ongoing compliance requirements including the obligations to disclose to the doj issues that may implicate the fcpa and to cooperate in any inquiries most countries in which we operate also have competition laws that prohibit competitors from colluding or otherwise attempting to reduce competition between themselves while we devote substantial resources to our us and international compliance programs and have implemented policies training and internal controls designed to reduce the risk of corrupt payments and collusive activity our employees vendors or agents may violate our policies our failure to comply with anticorruption laws or competition laws could result in significant fines and penalties criminal sanctions against us our officers or our employees prohibitions on the conduct of our business and damage to our reputation operations outside the us may be affected by changes in trade protection laws policies sanctions and other regulatory requirements affecting trade and investment we may be subject to legal liability and reputational damage if we sell goods or services in violation of us trade sanctions on restricted entities or countries such as crimea cuba iran north korea sudan and syria 

other regulatory areas that may apply to our products and online services offerings include user privacy telecommunications data storage and protection and online content for example some regulators are taking the position that our offerings such as microsoft teams and skype are covered by existing laws regulating telecommunications services and some new laws including eu member state laws under the european electronic communications code are defining more of our services as regulated telecommunications services this trend may continue and will result in these offerings being subjected to additional data protection security and law enforcement surveillance obligations data protection authorities may assert that our collection use and management of customer data is inconsistent with their laws and regulations legislative or regulatory action relating to cybersecurity requirements may increase the costs to develop implement or secure our products and services legislative or regulatory action could also emerge in the area of ai and content moderation increasing costs or restricting opportunity applying these laws and regulations to our business is often unclear subject to change over time and sometimes may conflict from jurisdiction to jurisdiction additionally these laws and governments’ approach to their enforcement and our products and services are continuing to evolve compliance with these types of regulation may involve significant costs or require changes in products or business practices that result in reduced revenue noncompliance could result in the imposition of penalties or orders we stop the alleged noncompliant activity 

we strive to empower all people and organizations to achieve more and accessibility of our products is an important aspect of this goal there is increasing pressure from advocacy groups regulators competitors customers and other stakeholders to make technology more accessible if our products do not meet customer expectations or emerging global accessibility requirements we could lose sales opportunities or face regulatory actions

laws and regulations relating to the handling of personal data may impede the adoption of our services or result in increased costs legal claims fines against us or reputational damage  the growth of our internet and cloudbased services internationally relies increasingly on the movement of data across national boundaries legal requirements relating to the collection storage handling and transfer of personal data continue to evolve for example in july 2020 the court of justice of the eu invalidated a framework called privacy shield for companies to transfer data from eu member states to the united states this ruling has led to uncertainty about the legal requirements for data transfers from the eu under other l egal mechanisms potential new rules and restrictions on the flow of data across borders could increase the cost and complexity of delivering our products and services in some markets in may 2018 the eu general data protection regulation “gdpr” became effective the law which applies to all of our activities conducted from an establishment in the eu or related to products and services offered in the eu imposes a range of compliance obligations regarding the handling of personal data engineering efforts to build and maintain capabilities to facilitate compliance with the law have entailed substantial expense and the diversion of engineering resources from other projects and may continue to do so we might experience reduced demand for our offerings if we are unable to engineer products that meet our legal duties or help our customers meet their obligations under the gdpr or other data regulations or if our implementation to comply with the gdpr make s our offerings less attractive the gdpr imposes significant new obligations and compliance with these obligations depends in part on how particular regulators interpret and apply them if we fail to comply with the gdpr or if regulators assert we have failed to comply with the gdpr it may lead to regulatory enforcement actions which can result in monetary penalties of up to 4 of worldwide revenue private lawsuits reputational damage  and loss of customers  countries around the world and states in the us  such as california  ha ve adopted or are considering adopting or expanding  laws and regulations imposing obligations regarding the handling of personal data 

the company’s investment in gaining insights from data is becoming central to the value of the services we deliver to customers to our operational efficiency and key opportunities in monetization customer perceptions of quality and operational efficiency our ability to use data in this way may be constrained by regulatory developments that impede realizing the expected return from this investment ongoing legal analyses reviews and inquiries by regulators of microsoft practices or relevant practices of other organizations may result in burdensome or inconsistent requirements including data sovereignty and localization requirements affecting the location movement collection and use of our customer and internal employee data as well as the management of that data compliance with applicable laws and regulations regarding personal data may require changes in services business practices or internal systems that result in increased costs lower revenue reduced efficiency or greater difficulty in competing with foreignbased firms compliance with data regulations might limit our ability to innovate or offer certain features and functionality in some jurisdictions where we operate failure to comply with existing or new rules may result in significant penalties or orders to stop the alleged noncompliant activity as well as negative publicity and diversion of management time and effort 

we may have additional tax liabilities we are subject to income taxes in the us and many foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes in the course of our business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain for example compliance with the 2017 united states tax cuts and jobs act “tcja” may require the collection of information not regularly produced within the company the use of estimates in our consolidated financial statements and the exercise of significant judgment in accounting for its provisions as regulations and guidance evolve with respect to the tcja and as we gather more information and perform more analysis our results may differ from previous estimates and may materially affect our consolidated financial statements 

we regularly are under audit by tax authorities in different jurisdictions although we believe that our provision for income taxes and our tax estimates are reasonable tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken in addition economic and political pressures to increase tax revenue in various jurisdictions may make resolving tax disputes favorably more difficult we are currently under internal revenue service audit for prior tax years with the primary unresolved issues relating to transfer pricing the final resolution of those audits and other audits or litigation may differ from the amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements and may materially affect our consolidated financial statements in the period or periods in which that determination is made

the proliferation of social media may increase the likelihood speed and magnitude of negative brand events if our brands or reputation are damaged it could negatively impact our revenues or margins or ability to attract the most highly qualified employees

our global business exposes us to operational and economic risks our customers are located throughout the world and a significant part of our revenue comes from international sales the global nature of our business creates operational and economic risks our results of operations may be affected by global regional and local economic developments monetary policy inflation and recession as well as political and military disputes in addition our international growth strategy includes certain markets the developing nature of which presents several risks including deterioration of social political labor or economic conditions in a country or region and difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations emerging nationalist trends in specific countries may significantly alter the trade environment changes to trade policy or agreements as a result of populism protectionism or economic nationalism may result in higher tariffs local sourcing initiatives or other developments that make it more difficult to sell our products in foreign countries disruptions of these kinds in developed or emerging markets could negatively impact demand for our products and services or increase operating costs although we hedge a portion of our international currency exposure significant fluctuations in foreign exchange rates between the us dollar and foreign currencies may adversely affect our results of operations  

our business with government customers may present additional uncertainties we derive substantial revenue from government contracts government contracts generally can present risks and challenges not present in private commercial agreements for instance we may be subject to government audits and investigations relating to these contracts we could be suspended or debarred as a governmental contractor we could incur civil and criminal fines and penalties and under certain circumstances contracts may be rescinded some agreements may allow a government to terminate without cause and provide for higher liability limits for certain losses some contracts may be subject to periodic funding approval reductions or delays which could adversely impact publicsector demand for our products and services these events could negatively impact our results of operations financial condition and reputation

challenging economic conditions also may impair the ability of our customers to pay for products and services they have purchased as a result allowances for doubtful accounts and writeoffs of accounts receivable may increase 

we maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings types and maturities these investments are subject to general credit liquidity market and interest rate risks which may be exacerbated by market downturns or events that affect global financial markets a significant part of our investment portfolio comprises us government securities if global financial markets decline for long periods or if there is a downgrade of the us government credit rating due to an actual or threatened default on government debt our investment portfolio may be adversely affected and we could determine that more of our investments have experienced an otherthantemporary decline in fair value requiring impairment charges that could adversely affect our consolidated financial statements

catastrophic events or geopolitical conditions may disrupt our business a disruption or failure of our systems or operations because of a major earthquake weather event cyberattack terrorist attack pandemic or other catastrophic event could cause delays in completing sales providing services or performing other critical functions our corporate headquarters a significant portion of our research and development activities and certain other essential business operations are in the seattle washington area and we have other business operations in the silicon valley area of california both of which are seismically active regions a catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our critical business or it systems or the infrastructure or systems they rely on such as power grids could harm our ability to conduct normal business operations providing our customers with more services and solutions in the cloud puts a premium on the resilience of our systems and strength of our business continuity management plans and magnifies the potential impact of prolonged service outages in our consolidated financial statements 

abrupt political change terrorist activity and armed conflict pose a risk of general economic disruption in affected countries which may increase our operating costs these conditions also may add uncertainty to the timing and budget for technology investment decisions by our customers and may cause supply chain disruptions for hardware manufacturers geopolitical change may result in changing regulatory requirements that could impact our operating strategies access to global markets hiring and profitability geopolitical instability may lead to sanctions and impact our ability to do business in some markets or with some publicsector customers any of these changes may negatively impact our revenues 

the occurrence of regional epidemics or a global pandemic may adversely affect our operations financial condition and results of operations the covid19 pandemic is having widespread rapidly evolving and unpredictable impacts on global society economies financial markets and business practices federal and state governments have implemented measures in an effort to contain the virus including social distancing travel restrictions border closures limitations on public gatherings work from home supply chain logistical changes and closure of nonessential businesses to protect the health and wellbeing of our employees suppliers and customers we have made substantial modifications to employee travel policies implemented office closures as employees are advised to work from home and cancelled or shifted our conferences and other marketing events to virtualonly through fiscal year 2021 the covid19 pandemic has impacted and may continue to impact our business operations including our employees customers partners and communities and there is substantial uncertainty in the nature and degree of its continued effects over time

in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal year 2020 we have experienced adverse impacts to our supply chain a slowdown in transactional licensing and lower demand for our advertising services the extent to which the covid19 pandemic impacts our business going forward will depend on numerous evolving factors we cannot reliably predict including the duration and scope of the pandemic governmental business and individuals actions in response to the pandemic and the impact on economic activity including the possibility of recession or financial market instability these factors may adversely impact consumer business and government spending on technology as well as customers ability to pay for our products and services on an ongoing basis this uncertainty also affects management’s accounting estimates and assumptions which could result in greater variability in a variety of areas that depend on these estimates and assumptions including investments receivables and forwardlooking guidance

our effective tax rate for fiscal years 2020 and 2019 was 17 and 10 respectively the increase in our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2020 compared to fiscal year 2019 was primarily due to a 26 billion net income tax benefit in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019 related to intangible property transfers our effective tax rate was lower than the us federal statutory rate primarily due to earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting from producing and distributing our products and services through our foreign regional operations centers in ireland and puerto rico and tax benefits relating to stockbased compensation

the mix of income before income taxes between the us and foreign countries impacted our effective tax rate as a result of the geographic distribution of and customer demand for our products and services in fiscal year 2020 our us income before income taxes was 241 billion and our foreign income before income taxes was 289 billion in fiscal year 2019 our us income before income taxes was 158 billion and our foreign income before income taxes was 279 billion

our effective tax rate for fiscal years 2019 and 2018 was 10 and 55 respectively the decrease in our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2019 compared to fiscal year 2018 was primarily due to the net charge related to the enactment of the tcja in the second quarter of fiscal year 2018 and a 26 billion net income tax benefit in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019 related to intangible property transfers our effective tax rate was lower than the us federal statutory rate primarily due to the tax benefit related to intangible property transfers and earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting from producing and distributing our products and services through our foreign regional operations centers in ireland singapore and puerto rico

the mix of income before income taxes between the us and foreign countries impacted our effective tax rate as a result of the geographic distribution of and customer demand for our products and services in fiscal year 2019 our us income before income taxes was 158 billion and our foreign income before income taxes was 279 billion in fiscal year 2018 our us income before income taxes was 115 billion and our foreign income before income taxes was 249 billion

in fiscal year 2019 in response to the tcja and recently issued regulations we transferred certain intangible properties held by our foreign subsidiaries to the us and ireland the transfers of intangible properties resulted in a 26 billion net income tax benefit recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019 as the value of future tax deductions exceeded the current tax liability from foreign jurisdictions and us global intangible lowtaxed income tax

uncertain tax positions 

we settled a portion of the internal revenue service “irs” audit for tax years 2004 to 2006 in fiscal year 2011 in february 2012 the irs withdrew its 2011 revenue agents report related to unresolved issues for tax years 2004 to 2006 and reopened the audit phase of the examination we also settled a portion of the irs audit for tax years 2007 to 2009 in fiscal year 2016 and a portion of the irs audit for tax years 2010 to 2013 in fiscal year 2018 we remain under audit for tax years 2004 to 2013 in april 2020 the irs commenced the audit for tax years 2014 to 2017 

as of june 30 2020 the primary unresolved issues for the irs audits relate to transfer pricing which could have a material impact in our consolidated financial statements when the matters are resolved we believe our allowances for income tax contingencies are adequate we have not received a proposed assessment for the unresolved issues and do not expect a final resolution of these issues in the next 12 months based on the information currently available we do not anticipate a significant increase or decrease to our tax contingencies for these issues within the next 12 months

we are subject to income tax in many jurisdictions outside the us our operations in certain jurisdictions remain subject to examination for tax years 1996 to 2019 some of which are currently under audit by local tax authorities the resolution of each of these audits is not expected to be material to our consolidated financial statements

valuation 

in general and where applicable we use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities to determine the fair value of our financial instruments this pricing methodology applies to our level 1 investments such as us government securities common and preferred stock and mutual funds if quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities are not available to determine fair value then we use quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities or inputs other than the quoted prices that are observable either directly or indirectly this pricing methodology applies to our level 2 investments such as commercial paper certificates of deposit us agency securities foreign government bonds mortgage and assetbacked securities corporate notes and bonds and municipal securities level 3 investments are valued using internallydeveloped models with unobservable inputs assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis using unobservable inputs are an immaterial portion of our portfolio 

a majority of our investments are priced by pricing vendors and are generally level 1 or level 2 investments as these vendors either provide a quoted market price in an active market or use observable inputs for their pricing without applying significant adjustments broker pricing is used mainly when a quoted price is not available the investment is not priced by our pricing vendors or when a broker price is more reflective of fair values in the market in which the investment trades our brokerpriced investments are generally classified as level 2 investments because the broker prices these investments based on similar assets without applying significant adjustments in addition all our brokerpriced investments have a sufficient level of trading volume to demonstrate that the fair values used are appropriate for these investments our fair value processes include controls that are designed to ensure appropriate fair values are recorded these controls include model validation review of key model inputs analysis of periodoverperiod fluctuations and independent recalculation of prices where appropriate

we will continue to invest in sales marketing product support infrastructure and existing and advanced areas of technology as well as continue making acquisitions that align with our business strategy additions to property and equipment will continue including new facilities datacenters and computer systems for research and development sales and marketing support and administrative staff we expect capital expenditures to increase in coming years to support growth in our cloud offerings we have operating and finance leases for datacenters corporate offices research and development facilities retail stores and certain equipment we have not engaged in any related party transactions or arrangements with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect liquidity or the availability of capital resources

recent accounting guidance 

refer to note 1 – accounting policies of the notes to financial statements part ii item 8 of this form 10k for further discussion

application of critical accounting policies 

our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with gaap preparing consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses these estimates and assumptions are affected by management’s application of accounting policies as well as uncertainty in the current economic environment due to the recent outbreak of covid19 critical accounting policies for us include revenue recognition impairment of investment securities goodwill research and development costs contingencies income taxes and inventories 

revenue recognition 

our contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer determining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together may require significant judgment when a cloudbased service includes both onpremises software licenses and cloud services judgment is required to determine whether the software license is considered distinct and accounted for separately or not distinct and accounted for together with the cloud service and recognized over time certain cloud services primarily office 365 depend on a significant level of integration interdependency and interrelation between the desktop applications and cloud services and are accounted for together as one performance obligation revenue from office 365 is recognized ratably over the period in which the cloud services are provided 

judgment is required to determine the standalone selling price “ssp for each distinct performance obligation we use a single amount to estimate ssp for items that are not sold separately including onpremises licenses sold with sa or software updates provided at no additional charge we use a range of amounts to estimate ssp when we sell each of the products and services separately and need to determine whether there is a discount to be allocated based on the relative ssp of the various products and services 

in instances where ssp is not directly observable such as when we do not sell the product or service separately we determine the ssp using information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs we typically have more than one ssp for individual products and services due to the stratification of those products and services by customers and circumstances in these instances we may use information such as the size of the customer and geographic region in determining the ssp 

due to the various benefits from and the nature of our sa program judgment is required to assess the pattern of delivery including the exercise pattern of certain benefits across our portfolio of customers 

our products are generally sold with a right of return we may provide other credits or incentives and in certain instances we estimate customer usage of our products and services which are accounted for as variable consideration when determining the amount of revenue to recognize returns and credits are estimated at contract inception and updated at the end of each reporting period if additional information becomes available changes to our estimated variable consideration were not material for the periods presented

impairment of investment securities 

we review debt investments quarterly for indicators of otherthantemporary impairment this determination requires significant judgment in making this judgment we employ a systematic methodology quarterly that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments if the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value we evaluate among other factors general market conditions credit quality of debt instrument issuers and the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost we also evaluate whether we have plans to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery in addition we consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the investee including industry and sector performance changes in technology and operational and financing cash flow factors once a decline in fair value is determined to be otherthantemporary an impairment charge is recorded in other income expense net and a new cost basis in the investment is established if market industry andor investee conditions deteriorate we may incur future impairments 

equity investments without readily determinable fair values are written down to fair value if a qualitative assessment indicates that the investment is impaired and the fair value of the investment is less than carrying value we perform a qualitative assessment on a quarterly basis we are required to estimate the fair value of the investment to determine the amount of the impairment loss once an investment is determined to be impaired an impairment charge is recorded in other income expense net 

goodwill 

we allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the business combination we evaluate our reporting units on an annual basis and if necessary reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level operating segment or one level below an operating segment on an annual basis may 1 for us and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value these events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate legal factors operating performance indicators competition or sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit 

application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment including the identification of reporting units assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units assignment of goodwill to reporting units and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit the fair value of each reporting unit is estimated primarily through the use of a discounted cash flow methodology this analysis requires significant judgments including estimation of future cash flows which is dependent on internal forecasts estimation of the longterm rate of growth for our business estimation of the useful life over which cash flows will occur and determination of our weighted average cost of capital 

the estimates used to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit change from year to year based on operating results market conditions and other factors changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and goodwill impairment for each reporting unit 

research and development costs 

costs incurred internally in researching and developing a computer software product are charged to expense until technological feasibility has been established for the product once technological feasibility is established software costs are capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers judgment is required in determining when technological feasibility of a product is established we have determined that technological feasibility for our software products is reached after all highrisk development issues have been resolved through coding and testing generally this occurs shortly before the products are released to production the amortization of these costs is included in cost of revenue over the estimated life of the products

legal and other contingencies 

the outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought against us are subject to significant uncertainty an estimated loss from a loss contingency such as a legal proceeding or claim is accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated in determining whether a loss should be accrued we evaluate among other factors the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss changes in these factors could materially impact our consolidated financial statements

income taxes 

the objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity’s financial statements or tax returns we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement accounting literature also provides guidance on derecognition of income tax assets and liabilities classification of deferred income tax assets and liabilities accounting for interest and penalties associated with tax positions and income tax disclosures judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our consolidated financial statements 

the tcja significantly changes existing us tax law and includes numerous provisions that affect our business refer to note 12 – income taxes of the notes to financial statements part ii item 8 of this form 10k for further discussion

inventories 

inventories are stated at average cost subject to the lower of cost or net realizable value cost includes materials labor and manufacturing overhead related to the purchase and production of inventories net realizable value is the estimated selling price less estimated costs of completion disposal and transportation we regularly review inventory quantities on hand future purchase commitments with our suppliers and the estimated utility of our inventory these reviews include analysis of demand forecasts product life cycle status product development plans current sales levels pricing strategy and component cost trends if our review indicates a reduction in utility below carrying value we reduce our inventory to a new cost basis through a charge to cost of revenue

change in accounting estimate 

in july 2020 we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our server and network equipment and determined we should increase the estimated useful life of server equipment from three years to four years and increase the estimated useful life of network equipment from two years to four years this change in accounting estimate will be effective beginning fiscal year 2021 based on the carrying amount of server and network equipment included in “property and equipment net” as of june 30 2020 it is estimated this change will increase our fiscal year 2021 operating income by 27 billion

research and development 

product and service development and intellectual property 

we develop most of our products and services internally through the following engineering groups 











internal development allows us to maintain competitive advantages that come from product differentiation and closer technical control over our products and services it also gives us the freedom to decide which modifications and enhancements are most important and when they should be implemented we strive to obtain information as early as possible about changing usage patterns and hardware advances that may affect software and hardware design before releasing new software platforms and as we make significant modifications to existing platforms we provide application vendors with a range of resources and guidelines for development training and testing generally we also create product documentation internally

 item 1a ris k factors 

our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties including those described below that could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations cash flows and the trading price of our common stock

we face intense competition across all markets for our products and services which may lead to lower revenue or operating margins 

competition in the technology sector

our competitors range in size from diversified global companies with significant research and development resources to small specialized firms whose narrower product lines may let them be more effective in deploying technical marketing and financial resources barriers to entry in many of our businesses are low and many of the areas in which we compete evolve rapidly with changing and disruptive technologies shifting user needs and frequent introductions of new products and services our ability to remain competitive depends on our success in making innovative products devices and services that appeal to businesses and consumers 

competition among platformbased ecosystems

an important element of our business model has been to create platformbased ecosystems on which many participants can build diverse solutions a wellestablished ecosystem creates beneficial network effects among users application developers and the platform provider that can accelerate growth establishing significant scale in the marketplace is necessary to achieve and maintain attractive margins we face significant competition from firms that provide competing platforms

business model competition 

companies compete with us based on a growing variety of business models 







the competitive pressures described above may cause decreased sales volumes price reductions andor increased operating costs such as for research and development marketing and sales incentives this may lead to lower revenue gross margins and operating income 

our increasing focus on cloudbased services presents execution and competitive risks a growing part of our business involves cloudbased services available across the spectrum of computing devices our strategic vision is to compete and grow by building bestinclass platforms and productivity services for an intelligent cloud and an intelligent edge infused with artificial intelligence “ai” at the same time our competitors are rapidly developing and deploying cloudbased services for consumers and business customers pricing and delivery models are evolving devices and form factors influence how users access services in the cloud and sometimes the user’s choice of which cloudbased services to use we are devoting significant resources to develop and deploy our cloudbased strategies the windows ecosystem must continue to evolve with this changing environment we are undertaking cultural and organizational changes to drive accountability and eliminate obstacles to innovation our intelligent cloud and intelligent edge worldview is connected with the growth of the internet of things “iot” our success in the iot will depend on the level of adoption of our offerings such as microsoft azure azure stack azure iot edge and azure sphere we may not establish market share sufficient to achieve scale necessary to achieve our business objectives 

besides software development costs we are incurring costs to build and maintain infrastructure to support cloud computing services these costs will reduce the operating margins we have previously achieved whether we succeed in cloudbased services depends on our execution in several areas including 











it is uncertain whether our strategies will attract the users or generate the revenue required to succeed if we are not effective in executing organizational and technical changes to increase efficiency and accelerate innovation or if we fail to generate sufficient usage of our new products and services we may not grow revenue in line with the infrastructure and development investments described above this may negatively impact gross margins and operating income

developing new technologies is complex it can require long development and testing periods significant delays in new releases or significant problems in creating new products or services could adversely affect our revenue 

acquisitions joint ventures and strategic alliances may have an adverse effect on our business we expect to continue making acquisitions and entering into joint ventures and strategic alliances as part of our longterm business strategy in december 2016 we completed our acquisition of linkedin corporation “linkedin” for 270 billion and in october 2018 we completed our acquisition of github inc for 75 billion these acquisitions and other transactions and arrangements involve significant challenges and risks including that they do not advance our business strategy that we get an unsatisfactory return on our investment that we have difficulty integrating and retaining new employees business systems and technology or that they distract management from our other businesses if an arrangement fails to adequately anticipate changing circumstances and interests of a party it may result in early termination or renegotiation of the arrangement the success of these transactions and arrangements will depend in part on our ability to leverage them to enhance our existing products and services or develop compelling new ones it may take longer than expected to realize the full benefits from these transactions and arrangements such as increased revenue or enhanced efficiencies or the benefits may ultimately be smaller than we expected these events could adversely affect our consolidated financial statements 

if our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets become impaired we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings we acquire other companies and intangible assets and may not realize all the economic benefit from those acquisitions which could cause an impairment of goodwill or intangibles we review our amortizable intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable we test goodwill for impairment at least annually factors that may be a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets may not be recoverable include a decline in our stock price and market capitalization reduced future cash flow estimates and slower growth rates in industry segments in which we participate we have in the past recorded and may in the future be required to record a significant charge on our consolidated financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets is determined negatively affecting our results of operations our acquisition of linkedin resulted in a significant increase in our goodwill and intangible asset balances

cyberattacks and security vulnerabilities could lead to reduced revenue increased costs liability claims or harm to our reputation or competitive position 

security of our information technology 

threats to it security can take a variety of forms individual and groups of hackers and sophisticated organizations including statesponsored organizations or nationstates continuously undertake attacks that pose threats to our customers and our it these actors may use a wide variety of methods which may include developing and deploying malicious software or exploiting vulnerabilities in hardware software or other infrastructure in order to attack our products and services or gain access to our networks and datacenters using social engineering techniques to induce our employees users partners or customers to disclose passwords or other sensitive information or take other actions to gain access to our data or our users’ or customers’ data or acting in a coordinated manner to launch distributed denial of service or other coordinated attacks inadequate account security practices may also result in unauthorized access to confidential data for example system administrators may fail to timely remove employee account access when no longer appropriate employees or third parties may intentionally compromise our or our users’ security or systems or reveal confidential information

cyberthreats are constantly evolving increasing the difficulty of detecting and successfully defending against them we may have no current capability to detect certain vulnerabilities which may allow them to persist in the environment over long periods of time cyberthreats can have cascading impacts that unfold with increasing speed across our internal networks and systems and those of our partners and customers breaches of our facilities network or data security could disrupt the security of our systems and business applications impair our ability to provide services to our customers and protect the privacy of their data result in product development delays compromise confidential or technical business information harming our reputation or competitive position result in theft or misuse of our intellectual property or other assets require us to allocate more resources to improved technologies or otherwise adversely affect our business

in addition our internal it environment continues to evolve often we are early adopters of new devices and technologies we embrace new ways of sharing data and communicating internally and with partners and customers using methods such as social networking and other consumeroriented technologies our business policies and internal security controls may not keep pace with these changes as new threats emerge

security of our products services devices and customers’ data

the security of our products and services is important in our customers’ decisions to purchase or use our products or services security threats are a significant challenge to companies like us whose business is providing technology products and services to others threats to our own it infrastructure can also affect our customers customers using our cloudbased services rely on the security of our infrastructure including hardware and other elements provided by third parties to ensure the reliability of our services and the protection of their data adversaries tend to focus their efforts on the most popular operating systems programs and services including many of ours and we expect that to continue adversaries that acquire user account information at other companies can use that information to compromise our users’ accounts where accounts share the same attributes like passwords inadequate account security practices may also result in unauthorized access we are also increasingly incorporating open source software into our products there may be vulnerabilities in open source software that may make our products susceptible to cyberattacks

to defend against security threats to our internal it systems our cloudbased services and our customers’ systems we must continuously engineer more secure products and services enhance security and reliability features improve the deployment of software updates to address security vulnerabilities in our own products as well as those provided by others develop mitigation technologies that help to secure customers from attacks even when software updates are not deployed maintain the digital security infrastructure that protects the integrity of our network products and services and provide security tools such as firewalls and antivirus software and information about the need to deploy security measures and the impact of doing so

the cost of these steps could reduc e our operating margins if we fail to do these things well actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products and services data corruption issues or reduced performance could harm our reputation and lead customers to reduce or delay future pu rchases of products or subscriptions to services or to use competing products or services customers may also spend more on protecting their existing computer systems from attack which could delay adoption of additional products or services customers ma y fail to update their systems continue to run software or operating systems we no longer support or may fail timely to install or enable security patches any of these could adversely affect our reputation and revenue actual or perceived vulnerabilitie s may lead to claims against us our license agreements typically contain provisions that eliminate or limit our exposure to liability but there is no assurance these provisions will withstand legal challenges at times to achieve commercial objectives we may enter into agreements with larger liability exposure to customers 

as illustrated by the spectre and meltdown threats our products operate in conjunction with and are dependent on products and components across a broad ecosystem of third parties if there is a security vulnerability in one of these components and if there is a security exploit targeting it we could face increased costs liability claims reduced revenue or harm to our reputation or competitive position

disclosure and misuse of personal data could result in liability and harm our reputation as we continue to grow the number and scale of our cloudbased offerings we store and process increasingly large amounts of personally identifiable information of our customers and users the continued occurrence of highprofile data breaches provides evidence of an external environment increasingly hostile to information security despite our efforts to improve the security controls across our business groups and geographies it is possible our security controls over personal data our training of employees and third parties on data security and other practices we follow may not prevent the improper disclosure or misuse of customer or user data we or our vendors store and manage in addition third parties who have limited access to our customer or user data may use this data in unauthorized ways improper disclosure or misuse could harm our reputation lead to legal exposure to customers or users or subject us to liability under laws that protect personal data resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue our software products and services also enable our customers and users to store and process personal data onpremises or increasingly in a cloudbased environment we host government authorities can sometimes require us to produce customer or user data in response to valid legal orders in the us and elsewhere we advocate for transparency concerning these requests and appropriate limitations on government authority to compel disclosure despite our efforts to protect customer and user data perceptions that the collection use and retention of personal information is not satisfactorily protected could inhibit sales of our products or services and could limit adoption of our cloudbased solutions by consumers businesses and government entities additional security measures we may take to address customer or user concerns or constraints on our flexibility to determine where and how to operate datacenters in response to customer or user expectations or governmental rules or actions may cause higher operating expenses or hinder growth of our products and services

our hosted consumer services as well as our enterprise services may be used by third parties to disseminate harmful or illegal content in violation of our terms or applicable law we may not proactively discover such content due to scale and the limitations of existing technologies and when discovered by users such content may negatively affect our reputation our brands and user engagement regulations and other initiatives to make platforms responsible for preventing or eliminating harmful content online are gaining momentum and we expect this to continue we may be subject to enhanced regulatory oversight substantial liability or reputational damage if we fail to comply with content moderation regulations adversely affecting our business and consolidated financial statements

the development of the iot presents security privacy and execution risks to support the growth of the intelligent cloud and the intelligent edge we are developing products services and technologies to power the iot a network of distributed and interconnected devices employing sensors data and computing capabilities including ai the iot’s great potential also carries substantial risks iot products and services may contain defects in design manufacture or operation that make them insecure or ineffective for their intended purposes an iot solution has multiple layers of hardware sensors processors software and firmware several of which we may not develop or control each layer including the weakest layer can impact the security of the whole system many iot devices have limited interfaces and ability to be updated or patched iot solutions may collect large amounts of data and our handling of iot data may not satisfy customers or regulatory requirements iot scenarios may increasingly affect personal health and safety if iot solutions that include our technologies do not work as intended violate the law or harm individuals or businesses we may be subject to legal claims or enforcement actions these risks if realized may increase our costs damage our reputation or brands or negatively impact our revenues or margins 

issues in the use of ai in our offerings may result in reputational harm or liability  we are building ai into many of our offerings and we expect this element of our business to grow we envision a future in which ai operating in our devices applications and the cloud helps our customers be more productive in their work and personal lives as with many disruptive innovations ai presents risks and challenges that could affect its adoption and therefore our business ai algorithms may be flawed datasets may be insufficient or contain biased information inappropriate or controversial data practices by microsoft or others could impair the acceptance of ai solutions these deficiencies could undermine the decisions predictions or analysis ai applications produce subjecting us to competitive harm legal liability and brand or reputational harm some ai scenarios present ethical issues if we enable or offer ai solutions that are controversial because of their impact on human rights privacy employment or other social issues we may experience brand or reputational harm 

we may have excessive outages data losses and disruptions of our online services if we fail to maintain an adequate operations infrastructure our increasing user traffic growth in services and the complexity of our products and services demand more computing power we spend substantial amounts to build purchase or lease datacenters and equipment and to upgrade our technology and network infrastructure to handle more traffic on our websites and in our datacenters these demands continue to increase as we introduce new products and services and support the growth of existing services such as bing azure microsoft account services office 365 microsoft teams dynamics 365 onedrive sharepoint online skype xbox live and outlookcom we are rapidly growing our business of providing a platform and backend hosting for services provided by third parties to their end users maintaining securing and expanding this infrastructure is expensive and complex it requires that we maintain an internet connectivity infrastructure that is robust and reliable within competitive and regulatory constraints that continue to evolve inefficiencies or operational failures including temporary or permanent loss of customer data or insufficient internet connectivity could diminish the quality of our products services and user experience resulting in contractual liability claims by customers and other third parties regulatory actions damage to our reputation and loss of current and potential users subscribers and advertisers each of which may adversely impact our consolidated financial statements 

we may experience quality or supply problems our hardware products such as xbox consoles surface devices and other devices we design manufacture and market are highly complex and can have defects in design manufacture or associated software we could incur significant expenses lost revenue and reputational harm as a result of recalls safety alerts or product liability claims if we fail to prevent detect or address such issues through design testing or warranty repairs 

part i 

item 1a

 

our software products and services also may experience quality or reliability problems the highly sophis ticated software we develop may contain bugs and other defects that interfere with their intended operation our customers increasingly rely on us for critical functions potentially magnifying the impact of quality or reliability issues any defects we do not detect and fix in prerelease testing could cause reduced sales and revenue damage to our reputation repair or remediation costs delays in the release of new products or versions or legal liability although our license agreements typically contai n provisions that eliminate or limit our exposure to liability there is no assurance these provisions will withstand legal challenge 

we acquire some device and datacenter components from sole suppliers our competitors use some of the same suppliers and their demand for hardware components can affect the capacity available to us if a component from a solesource supplier is delayed or becomes unavailable whether because of supplier capacity constraint industry shortages legal or regulatory changes or other reasons we may not obtain timely replacement supplies resulting in reduced sales or inadequate datacenter capacity component shortages excess or obsolete inventory or price reductions resulting in inventory adjustments may increase our cost of revenue xbox consoles surface devices datacenter servers and other hardware are assembled in asia and other geographies that may be subject to disruptions in the supply chain resulting in shortages that would affect our revenue and operating margins these same risks would apply to any other hardware and software products we may offer 

we may not be able to protect our source code from copying if there is an unauthorized disclosure source code the detailed program commands for our operating systems and other software programs is critical to our business although we license portions of our application and operating system source code to several licensees we take significant measures to protect the secrecy of large portions of our source code if our source code leaks we might lose future trade secret protection for that code it may then become easier for third parties to compete with our products by copying functionality which could adversely affect our revenue and operating margins unauthorized disclosure of source code also could increase the security risks described in the next paragraph 

legal changes our evolving business model piracy and other factors may decrease the value of our intellectual property protecting our intellectual property rights and combating unlicensed copying and use of our software and other intellectual property on a global basis is difficult while piracy adversely affects us revenue the impact on revenue from outside the us is more significant particularly countries in which the legal system provides less protection for intellectual property rights our revenue in these markets may grow more slowly than the underlying device market similarly the absence of harmonized patent laws makes it more difficult to ensure consistent respect for patent rights throughout the world we educate users about the benefits of licensing genuine products and obtaining indemnification benefits for intellectual property risks and we educate lawmakers about the advantages of a business climate where intellectual property rights are protected reductions in the legal protection for software intellectual property rights could adversely affect revenue 

we expend significant resources to patent the intellectual property we create with the expectation that we will generate revenues by incorporating that intellectual property in our products or services or in some instances by licensing our patents to others in return for a royalty changes in the law may continue to weaken our ability to prevent the use of patented technology or collect revenue for licensing our patents these include legislative changes and regulatory actions that make it more difficult to obtain injunctions and the increasing use of legal process to challenge issued patents similarly licensees of our patents may fail to satisfy their obligations to pay us royalties or may contest the scope and extent of their obligations the royalties we can obtain to monetize our intellectual property may decline because of the evolution of technology selling price changes in products using licensed patents or the difficulty of discovering infringements finally our increasing engagement with open source software will also cause us to license our intellectual property rights broadly in certain situations and may negatively impact revenue

third parties may claim we infringe their intellectual property rights from time to time others claim we infringe their intellectual property rights the number of these claims may grow bec ause of constant technological change in the markets in which we compete the extensive patent coverage of existing technologies the rapid rate of issuance of new patents and our offering of firstparty devices such as microsoft surface to resolve thes e claims we may enter into royalty and licensing agreements on terms that are less favorable than currently available stop selling or redesign affected products or services or pay damages to satisfy indemnification commitments with our customers these outcomes may cause operating margins to decline besides money damages in some jurisdictions plaintiffs can seek injunctive relief that may limit or prevent importing marketing and selling our products or services that have infringing technologies in s ome countries such as germany an injunction can be issued before the parties have fully litigated the validity of the underlying patents we have paid significant amounts to settle claims related to the use of technology and intellectual property rights and to procure intellectual property rights as part of our strategy to manage this risk and may continue to do so 

we have claims and lawsuits against us that may result in adverse outcomes we are subject to a variety of claims and lawsuits these claims may arise from a wide variety of business practices and initiatives including major new product releases such as windows 10 significant business transactions warranty or product claims and employment practices adverse outcomes in some or all of these claims may result in significant monetary damages or injunctive relief that could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business the litigation and other claims are subject to inherent uncertainties and management’s view of these matters may change in the future a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements could occur for the period in which the effect of an unfavorable outcome becomes probable and reasonably estimable 

government litigation and regulatory activity relating to competition rules may limit how we design and market our products as a leading global software and device maker government agencies closely scrutinize us under us and foreign competition laws governments are actively enforcing competition laws and regulations and this includes scrutiny in potentially large markets such as the european union “eu” the us and china some jurisdictions also allow competitors or consumers to assert claims of anticompetitive conduct us federal and state antitrust authorities have previously brought enforcement actions and continue to scrutinize our business 

the european commission “the commission” closely scrutinizes the design of highvolume microsoft products and the terms on which we make certain technologies used in these products such as file formats programming interfaces and protocols available to other companies flagship product releases such as windows 10 can receive significant scrutiny under competition laws for example in 2004 the commission ordered us to create new versions of our windows operating system that do not include certain multimedia technologies and to provide our competitors with specifications for how to implement certain proprietary windows communications protocols in their own products in 2009 the commission accepted a set of commitments we offered to address the commission’s concerns relating to competition in web browsing software including an undertaking to address commission concerns relating to interoperability the web browsing commitments expired in 2014 the remaining obligations may limit our ability to innovate in windows or other products in the future diminish the developer appeal of the windows platform and increase our product development costs the availability of licenses related to protocols and file formats may enable competitors to develop software products that better mimic the functionality of our products which could hamper sales of our products 

our portfolio of firstparty devices continues to grow at the same time our oem partners offer a large variety of devices for our platforms as a result increasingly we both cooperate and compete with our oem partners creating a risk that we fail to do so in compliance with competition rules regulatory scrutiny in this area may increase certain foreign governments particularly in china and other countries in asia have advanced arguments under their competition laws that exert downward pressure on royalties for our intellectual property 

government regulatory actions and court decisions such as these may result in fines or hinder our ability to provide the benefits of our software to consumers and businesses reducing the attractiveness of our products and the revenue that come from them new competition law actions could be initiated potentially using previous actions as precedent the outcome of such actions or steps taken to avoid them could adversely affect us in a variety of ways including

our global operations subject us to potential liability under anticorruption trade protection and other laws and regulations the foreign corrupt practices act “fcpa” and other anticorruption laws and regulations “anticorruption laws” prohibit corrupt payments by our employees vendors or agents and the accounting provisions of the fcpa require us to maintain accurate books and records and adequate internal controls from time to time we receive inquiries from authorities in the us and elsewhere which may be based on reports from employees and others about our business activities outside the us and our compliance with anticorruption laws periodically we receive such reports directly and investigate them on july 22 2019 our hungarian subsidiary entered into a nonprosecution agreement “npa” with the us department of justice “doj” and we agreed to the terms of a cease and desist order with the securities and exchange commission these agreements required us to pay 253 million in monetary penalties disgorgement and interest pertaining to activities at microsoft’s subsidiary in hungary the npa which has a threeyear term also contains certain ongoing compliance requirements including the obligations to disclose to the doj issues that may implicate the fcpa and to cooperate in any inquiries most countries in which we operate also have competition laws that prohibit competitors from colluding or otherwise attempting to reduce competition between themselves while we devote substantial resources to our us and international compliance programs and have implemented policies training and internal controls designed to reduce the risk of corrupt payments and collusive activity our employees vendors or agents may violate our policies our failure to comply with anticorruption laws or competition laws could result in significant fines and penalties criminal sanctions against us our officers or our employees prohibitions on the conduct of our business and damage to our reputation operations outside the us may be affected by changes in trade protection laws policies sanctions and other regulatory requirements affecting trade and investment we may be subject to legal liability and reputational damage if we sell goods or services in violation of us trade sanctions on restricted entities or countries such as iran north korea cuba sudan and syria 

other regulatory areas that may apply to our products and online services offerings include user privacy telecommunications data storage and protection and online content for example some regulators are taking the position that our offerings such as skype are covered by existing laws regulating telecommunications services and some new laws are defining more of our services as regulated telecommunications services this trend may continue and will result in these offerings being subjected to additional data protection security and law enforcement surveillance obligations data protection authorities may assert that our collection use and management of customer data is inconsistent with their laws and regulations legislative or regulatory action relating to cybersecurity requirements may increase the costs to develop implement or secure our products and services legislative or regulatory action could also emerge in the area of ai and content moderation increasing costs or restricting opportunity applying these laws and regulations to our business is often unclear subject to change over time and sometimes may conflict from jurisdiction to jurisdiction additionally these laws and governments’ approach to their enforcement and our products and services are continuing to evolve compliance with these types of regulation may involve significant costs or require changes in products or business practices that result in reduced revenue noncompliance could result in the imposition of penalties or orders we stop the alleged noncompliant activity 

we strive to empower all people and organizations to achieve more and accessibility of our products is an important aspect of this goal there is increasing pressure from advocacy groups regulators competitors customers and other stakeholders to make technology more accessible if our products do not meet customer expectations or emerging global accessibility requirements we could lose sales opportunities or face regulatory actions

laws and regulations relating to the handling of personal data may impede the adoption of our services or result in increased costs legal claims fines against us  or reputational damage  the growth of our internet and cloudbased services internationally relies increasingly on the movement of data across national boundaries legal requirements relating to the collection storage handling and transfer of personal data continue to evolve  for example the eu and the us formally entered into a new framework in july 2016 that provides a mechanism for companies to transfer data from eu member states to the us this framework called the privacy shield is intended to address shortcomings identified by the european court of justice in a predecessor mechanism the privacy shield and other mechanisms are currently subject to challenges in european courts which may lead to uncertainty about the legal basis for data transfers across the atlant ic the privacy shield and other potential rules on the flow of data across borders could increase the cost and complexity of delivering our products and services in some markets in may 2018 a new eu law governing data practices and privacy  the general data protection regulation “gdpr” bec a me effective the law  which applies to all of our activities conducted from an establishment in the eu or related to products and services offered in the eu imposes a range of new compliance obligations regarding the handling of personal data engineering efforts to build new capabilities to facilitate compliance with the law have entailed substantial expense and the diversion of engineering resources from other projects and may continue to do so we might experien ce reduced demand for our offerings if we are unable to engineer products that meet our legal duties or help our customers meet their obligations under the gdpr or other data regulations or if the changes we implement to comply with the gdpr make our offe rings less attractive the gdpr imposes significant new obligations and compliance with these obligations depends in part on how particular regulators interpret and apply them if we fail to comply with the gdpr or if regulators assert we have failed to c omply with the gdpr it may lead to regulatory enforcement actions which can result in monetary penalties of up to 4 of worldwide revenue private lawsuits  or reputational damage  in the us california has adopted and several states are considering ad opting laws and regulations imposing obligations regarding the handling of personal data 

the company’s investment in gaining insights from data is becoming central to the value of the services we deliver to customers to our operational efficiency and key opportunities in monetization customer perceptions of quality and operational efficiency our ability to use data in this way may be constrained by regulatory developments that impede realizing the expected return from this investment ongoing legal reviews by regulators may result in burdensome or inconsistent requirements including data sovereignty and localization requirements affecting the location and movement of our customer and internal employee data as well as the management of that data compliance with applicable laws and regulations regarding personal data may require changes in services business practices or internal systems that result in increased costs lower revenue reduced efficiency or greater difficulty in competing with foreignbased firms compliance with data regulations might limit our ability to innovate or offer certain features and functionality in some jurisdictions where we operate failure to comply with existing or new rules may result in significant penalties or orders to stop the alleged noncompliant activity as well as negative publicity and diversion of management time and effort 

we may have additional tax liabilities we are subject to income taxes in the us and many foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes in the course of our business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain for example compliance with the 2017 united states tax cuts and jobs act “tcja” may require the collection of information not regularly produced within the company the use of estimates in our consolidated financial statements and the exercise of significant judgment in accounting for its provisions as regulations and guidance evolve with respect to the tcja and as we gather more information and perform more analysis our results may differ from previous estimates and may materially affect our consolidated financial statements 

we regularly are under audit by tax authorities in different jurisdictions although we believe that our provision for income taxes and our tax estimates are reasonable tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken in addition economic and political pressures to increase tax revenue in various jurisdictions may make resolving tax disputes favorably more difficult we are currently under internal revenue service audit for prior tax years with the primary unresolved issues relating to transfer pricing the final resolution of those audits and other audits or litigation may differ from the amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements and may materially affect our consolidated financial statements in the period or periods in which that determination is made

adverse economic or market conditions may harm our business worsening economic conditions including inflation recession or other changes in economic conditions may cause lower it spending and adversely affect our revenue if demand for pcs servers and other computing devices declines or consumer or business spending for those products declines our revenue will be adversely affected substantial revenue comes from our us government contracts an extended federal government shutdown resulting from failing to pass budget appropriations adopt continuing funding resolutions or raise the debt ceiling and other budgetary decisions limiting or delaying federal government spending could reduce government it spending on our products and services and adversely affect our revenue 

our product distribution system relies on an extensive partner and retail network oems building devices that run our software have also been a significant means of distribution the impact of economic conditions on our partners such as the bankruptcy of a major distributor oem or retailer could cause sales channel disruption

our international operations provide a significant portion of our total revenue and expenses many of these revenue and expenses are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar as a result changes in foreign exchange rates may significantly affect revenue and expenses strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the us dollar throughout fiscal year 2018 positively impacted reported revenue and increased reported expenses from our international operations strengthening of the us dollar relative to certain foreign currencies did not significantly impact reported revenue or expenses from our international operations in the first and second quarters of fiscal year 2019 and reduced reported revenue and expenses from our international operations in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal year 2019

income taxes 

effective tax rate

fiscal year 2019 compared with fiscal year 2018 

our effective tax rate for fiscal years 2019 and 2018 was 10 and 55 respectively the decrease in our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2019 compared to fiscal year 2018 was primarily due to the net charge related to the enactment of the tcja in the second quarter of fiscal year 2018 and a 26 billion net income tax benefit in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019 related to intangible property transfers our effective tax rate was lower than the us federal statutory rate primarily due to the tax benefit related to intangible property transfers and earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting from producing and distributing our products and services through our foreign regional operations centers in ireland singapore and puerto rico

the mix of income before income taxes between the us and foreign countries impacted our effective tax rate as a result of the geographic distribution of and customer demand for our products and services in fiscal year 2019 our us income before income taxes was 158 billion and our foreign income before income taxes was 279 billion in fiscal year 2018 our us income before income taxes was 115 billion and our foreign income before income taxes was 249 billion

fiscal year 2018 compared with fiscal year 2017 

our effective tax rate for fiscal years 2018 and 2017 was 55 and 15 respectively the increase in our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2018 compared to fiscal year 2017 was primarily due to the net charge related to the enactment of the tcja in fiscal year 2018 and the realization of tax benefits attributable to previous phone business losses in fiscal year 2017 our effective tax rate was higher than the us federal statutory rate primarily due to the net charge related to the enactment of the tcja offset in part by earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting from our foreign regional operations centers in ireland singapore and puerto rico 

the mix of income before income taxes between the us and foreign countries impacted our effective tax rate as a result of the geographic distribution of and customer demand for our products and services in fiscal year 2018 our us income before income taxes was 115 billion and our foreign income before income taxes was 249 billion in fiscal year 2017 our us income before income taxes was 68 billion and our foreign income before income taxes was 231 billion

tax cuts and jobs act 

on december 22 2017 the tcja was enacted into law which significantly changed existing us tax law and included numerous provisions that affect our business such as imposing a onetime transition tax on deemed repatriation of deferred foreign income reducing the us federal statutory tax rate and adopting a territorial tax system in fiscal year 2018 the tcja required us to incur a transition tax on deferred foreign income not previously subject to us income tax at a rate of 155 for foreign cash and certain other net current assets and 8 on the remaining income the tcja reduced the us federal statutory tax rate from 35 to 21 effective january 1 2018 in addition the tcja subjected us to a tax on our global intangible lowtaxed income “gilti” effective july 1 2018

under gaap we can make an accounting policy election to either treat taxes due on the gilti inclusion as a current period expense or factor such amounts into our measurement of deferred taxes we elected the deferred method under which we recorded the corresponding deferred tax assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets

during fiscal year 2018 we recorded a net charge of 137 billion related to the enactment of the tcja due to the impact of the onetime transition tax on the deemed repatriation of deferred foreign income of 179 billion offset in part by the impact of changes in the tax rate of 42 billion primarily on deferred tax assets and liabilities during the second quarter of fiscal year 2019 we recorded additional tax expense of 157 million which related to completing our provisional accounting for gilti deferred taxes pursuant to securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 118 

in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019 in response to the tcja and recently issued regulations we transferred certain intangible properties held by our foreign subsidiaries to the us and ireland the transfers of intangible properties resulted in a 26 billion net income tax benefit recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019 as the value of future tax deductions exceeded the current tax liability from foreign jurisdictions and us gilti tax

uncertain tax positions 

we settled a portion of the internal revenue service “irs” audit for tax years 2004 to 2006 in fiscal year 2011 in february 2012 the irs withdrew its 2011 revenue agents report related to unresolved issues for tax years 2004 to 2006 and reopened the audit phase of the examination we also settled a portion of the irs audit for tax years 2007 to 2009 in fiscal year 2016 and a portion of the irs audit for tax years 2010 to 2013 in fiscal year 2018 we remain under audit for tax years 2004 to 2013 we expect the irs to begin an examination of tax years 2014 to 2017 within the next 12 months 

as of june 30 2019 the primary unresolved issues for the irs audits relate to transfer pricing which could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements when the matters are resolved we believe our allowances for income tax contingencies are adequate we have not received a proposed assessment for the unresolved issues and do not expect a final resolution of these issues in the next 12 months based on the information currently available we do not anticipate a significant increase or decrease to our tax contingencies for these issues within the next 12 months

we are subject to income tax in many jurisdictions outside the us our operations in certain jurisdictions remain subject to examination for tax years 1996 to 2018 some of which are currently under audit by local tax authorities the resolution of each of these audits is not expected to be material to our consolidated financial statements

nongaap financial measures 

nongaap operating income net income and diluted eps are nongaap financial measures which exclude the net tax impact of transfer of intangible properties the net tax impact of the tcja and restructuring expenses we believe these nongaap measures aid investors by providing additional insight into our operational performance and help clarify trends affecting our business for comparability of reporting management considers nongaap measures in conjunction with gaap financial results in evaluating business performance these nongaap financial measures presented should not be considered a substitute for or superior to the measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with gaap

cash cash equivalents and investments 

cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments totaled 1338 billion as of both june 30 2019 and 2018 equity investments were 26 billion and 19 billion as of june 30 2019 and 2018 respectively our shortterm investments are primarily intended to facilitate liquidity and capital preservation they consist predominantly of highly liquid investmentgrade fixedincome securities diversified among industries and individual issuers the investments are predominantly us dollardenominated securities but also include foreign currencydenominated securities to diversify risk our fixedincome investments are exposed to interest rate risk and credit risk the credit risk and average maturity of our fixedincome portfolio are managed to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain fixedincome indices the settlement risk related to these investments is insignificant given that the shortterm investments held are primarily highly liquid investmentgrade fixedincome securities 

valuation 

in general and where applicable we use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities to determine the fair value of our financial instruments this pricing methodology applies to our level 1 investments such as us government securities common and preferred stock and mutual funds if quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities are not available to determine fair value then we use quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities or inputs other than the quoted prices that are observable either directly or indirectly this pricing methodology applies to our level 2 investments such as commercial paper certificates of deposit us agency securities foreign government bonds mortgage and assetbacked securities corporate notes and bonds and municipal securities level 3 investments are valued using internallydeveloped models with unobservable inputs assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis using unobservable inputs are an immaterial portion of our portfolio 

a majority of our investments are priced by pricing vendors and are generally level 1 or level 2 investments as these vendors either provide a quoted market price in an active market or use observable inputs for their pricing without applying significant adjustments broker pricing is used mainly when a quoted price is not available the investment is not priced by our pricing vendors or when a broker price is more reflective of fair values in the market in which the investment trades our brokerpriced investments are generally classified as level 2 investments because the broker prices these investments based on similar assets without applying significant adjustments in addition all our brokerpriced investments have a sufficient level of trading volume to demonstrate that the fair values used are appropriate for these investments our fair value processes include controls that are designed to ensure appropriate fair values are recorded these controls include model validation review of key model inputs analysis of periodoverperiod fluctuations and independent recalculation of prices where appropriate

recent accounting guidance 

refer to note 1 – accounting policies of the notes to financial statements part ii item 8 of this form 10k for further discussion

application of critical accounting policies 

our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with gaap preparing consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses these estimates and assumptions are affected by management’s application of accounting policies critical accounting policies for us include revenue recognition impairment of investment securities goodwill research and development costs contingencies income taxes and inventories 

revenue recognition 

our contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer determining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together may require significant judgment when a cloudbased service includes both onpremises software licenses and cloud services judgment is required to determine whether the software license is considered distinct and accounted for separately or not distinct and accounted for together with the cloud service and recognized over time certain cloud services primarily office 365 depend on a significant level of integration interdependency and interrelation between the desktop applications and cloud services and are accounted for together as one performance obligation revenue from office 365 is recognized ratably over the period in which the cloud services are provided 

judgment is required to determine the standalone selling price “ssp for each distinct performance obligation we use a single amount to estimate ssp for items that are not sold separately including onpremises licenses sold with sa or software updates provided at no additional charge we use a range of amounts to estimate ssp when we sell each of the products and services separately and need to determine whether there is a discount to be allocated based on the relative ssp of the various products and services 

in instances where ssp is not directly observable such as when we do not sell the product or service separately we determine the ssp using information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs we typically have more than one ssp for individual products and services due to the stratification of those products and services by customers and circumstances in these instances we may use information such as the size of the customer and geographic region in determining the ssp 

due to the various benefits from and the nature of our sa program judgment is required to assess the pattern of delivery including the exercise pattern of certain benefits across our portfolio of customers 

our products are generally sold with a right of return we may provide other credits or incentives and in certain instances we estimate customer usage of our products and services which are accounted for as variable consideration when determining the amount of revenue to recognize returns and credits are estimated at contract inception and updated at the end of each reporting period if additional information becomes available changes to our estimated variable consideration were not material for the periods presented

item 7

 

impairment of investment securities 

we review debt investments quarterly for indicators of otherthantemporary impairment this determination requires significant judgment in making this judgment we employ a systematic methodology quarterly that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments if the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value we evaluate among other factors general market conditions credit quality of debt instrument issuers and the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost we also evaluate whether we have plans to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery in addition we consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the investee including industry and sector performance changes in technology and operational and financing cash flow factors once a decline in fair value is determined to be otherthantemporary an impairment charge is recorded in other income expense net and a new cost basis in the investment is established if market industry andor investee conditions deteriorate we may incur future impairments 

equity investments without readily determinable fair values are written down to fair value if a qualitative assessment indicates that the investment is impaired and the fair value of the investment is less than carrying value we perform a qualitative assessment on a quarterly basis we are required to estimate the fair value of the investment to determine the amount of the impairment loss once an investment is determined to be impaired an impairment charge is recorded in other income expense net 

goodwill 

we allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the business combination we evaluate our reporting units on an annual basis and if necessary reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level operating segment or one level below an operating segment on an annual basis may 1 for us and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value these events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate legal factors operating performance indicators competition or sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit 

application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment including the identification of reporting units assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units assignment of goodwill to reporting units and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit the fair value of each reporting unit is estimated primarily through the use of a discounted cash flow methodology this analysis requires significant judgments including estimation of future cash flows which is dependent on internal forecasts estimation of the longterm rate of growth for our business estimation of the useful life over which cash flows will occur and determination of our weighted average cost of capital 

the estimates used to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit change from year to year based on operating results market conditions and other factors changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and goodwill impairment for each reporting unit 

research and development costs 

costs incurred internally in researching and developing a computer software product are charged to expense until technological feasibility has been established for the product once technological feasibility is established software costs are capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers judgment is required in determining when technological feasibility of a product is established we have determined that technological feasibility for our software products is reached after all highrisk development issues have been resolved through coding and testing generally this occurs shortly before the products are released to production the amortization of these costs is included in cost of revenue over the estimated life of the products 

legal and other contingencies 

the outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought against us are subject to significant uncertainty an estimated loss from a loss contingency such as a legal proceeding or claim is accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated in determining whether a loss should be accrued we evaluate among other factors the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss changes in these factors could materially impact our consolidated financial statements

item 7

 

income taxes 

the objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity’s financial statements or tax returns we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement accounting literature also provides guidance on derecognition of income tax assets and liabilities classification of deferred income tax assets and liabilities accounting for interest and penalties associated with tax positions and income tax disclosures judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized on our consolidated financial statements or tax returns variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our consolidated financial statements 

the tcja significantly changes existing us tax law and includes numerous provisions that affect our business refer to note 12 – income taxes of the notes to financial statements part ii item 8 of this form 10k for further discussion

inventories 

inventories are stated at average cost subject to the lower of cost or net realizable value cost includes materials labor and manufacturing overhead related to the purchase and production of inventories net realizable value is the estimated selling price less estimated costs of completion disposal and transportation we regularly review inventory quantities on hand future purchase commitments with our suppliers and the estimated utility of our inventory these reviews include analysis of demand forecasts product life cycle status product development plans current sales levels pricing strategy and component cost trends if our review indicates a reduction in utility below carrying value we reduce our inventory to a new cost basis through a charge to cost of revenue

product and service development and intellectual property 

we develop most of our products and services internally through the following engineering groups 











internal development allows us to maintain competitive advantages that come from product differentiation and closer technical control over our products and services it also gives us the freedom to decide which modifications and enhancements are most important and when they should be implemented we strive to obtain information as early as possible about changing usage patterns and hardware advances that may affect software and hardware design before releasing new software platforms and as we make significant modifications to existing platforms we provide application vendors with a range of resources and guidelines for development training and testing generally we also create product documentation internally 

we protect our intellectual property investments in a variety of ways we work actively in the us and internationally to ensure the enforcement of copyright trademark trade secret and other protections that apply to our software and hardware products services business plans and branding we are a leader among technology companies in pursuing patents and currently have a portfolio of over 53000 us and international patents issued and over 29000 pending while we employ much of our internally developed intellectual property exclusively in our products and services we also engage in outbound licensing of specific patented technologies that are incorporated into licensees’ products from time to time we enter into broader crosslicense agreements with other technology companies covering entire groups of patents we also purchase or license technology that we incorporate into our products and services at times we make select intellectual property broadly available at no or low cost to achieve a strategic objective such as promoting industry standards advancing interoperability or attracting and enabling our external development community our increasing engagement with open source software will also cause us to license our intellectual property rights broadly in certain situations

while it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of our products services and business methods we believe based upon past experience and industry practice such licenses generally can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms we believe our continuing research and product development are not materially dependent on any single license or other agreement with a third party relating to the development of our products

 item 1a ris k factors 

our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties including those described below that could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations cash flows and the trading price of our common stock 

we face intense competition across all markets for our products and services which may lead to lower revenue or operating margins 

competition in the technology sector 

our competitors range in size from diversified global companies with significant research and development resources to small specialized firms whose narrower product lines may let them be more effective in deploying technical marketing and financial resources barriers to entry in many of our businesses are low and many of the areas in which we compete evolve rapidly with changing and disruptive technologies shifting user needs and frequent introductions of new products and services our ability to remain competitive depends on our success in making innovative products devices and services that appeal to businesses and consumers

competition among platformbased ecosystems 

an important element of our business model has been to create platformbased ecosystems on which many participants can build diverse solutions a wellestablished ecosystem creates beneficial network effects among users application developers and the platform provider that can accelerate growth establishing significant scale in the marketplace is necessary to achieve and maintain attractive margins we face significant competition from firms that provide competing platforms

business model competition 

companies compete with us based on a growing variety of business models 







the competitive pressures described above may cause decreased sales volumes price reductions andor increased operating costs such as for research and development marketing and sales incentives this may lead to lower revenue gross margins and operating income 

our increasing focus on cloudbased services presents execution and competitive risks a growing part of our business involves cloudbased services available across the spectrum of computing devices our strategic vision is to compete and grow by building bestinclass platforms and productivity services for an intelligent cloud and an intelligent edge infused with artificial intelligence “ai” at the same time our competitors are rapidly developing and deploying cloudbased services for consumers and business customers pricing and delivery models are evolving devices and form factors influence how users access services in the cloud and sometimes the user’s choice of which suite of cloudbased services to use we are devoting significant resources to develop and deploy our cloudbased strategies the windows ecosystem must continue to evolve with this changing environment we are undertaking cultural and organizational changes to drive accountability and eliminate obstacles to innovation our intelligent cloud and intelligent edge worldview is connected with the growth of the internet of things “iot” our success in the iot will depend on the level of adoption of our offerings such as microsoft azure azure stack azure iot edge and azure sphere we may not establish market share sufficient to achieve scale necessary to achieve our business objectives 

besides software development costs we are incurring costs to build and maintain infrastructure to support cloud computing services these costs will reduce the operating margins we have previously achieved whether we succeed in cloudbased services depends on our execution in several areas including 











it is uncertain whether our strategies will attract the users or generate the revenue required to succeed if we are not effective in executing organizational and technical changes to increase efficiency and accelerate innovation or if we fail to generate sufficient usage of our new products and services we may not grow revenue in line with the infrastructure and development investments described above this may negatively impact gross margins and operating income

we make significant investment s in new products and services that may not achieve expected returns we will continue to make significant investments in research development and marketing for existing products services and technologies including the windows operating system micros oft 365 office bing microsoft sql server windows server the windows store azure office 365 xbox live mixer linkedin and other cloudbased offerings we also invest in the development and acquisition of a variety of hardware for productivity com munication and entertainment including pcs tablets gaming devices and hololens investments in new technology are speculative commercial success depends on many factors including innovativeness developer support and effective distribution and marke ting if customers do not perceive our latest offerings as providing significant new functionality or other value they may reduce their purchases of new software and hardware products or upgrades unfavorably affecting revenue we may not achieve signific ant revenue from new product service and distribution channel investments for several years if at all new products and services may not be profitable and even if they are profitable operating margins for some new products and businesses will not be a s high as the margins we have experienced historically we may not get engagement in certain features like windows store microsoft edge  and bing that drive postlicense monetization opportunities our data handling practices across our products and ser vices will continue to be under scrutiny and perceptions of mismanagement driven by regulatory activity or negative public reaction to our practices or product experiences which could negatively impact product and feature adoption product design  and pr oduct quality 

developing new technologies is complex it can require long development and testing periods significant delays in new releases or significant problems in creating new products or services could adversely affect our revenue 

acquisitions joint ventures and strategic alliances may have an adverse effect on our business we expect to continue making acquisitions and entering into joint ventures and strategic alliances as part of our longterm business strategy in december 2016 we completed our acquisition of linkedin corporation for 270 billion in june 2018 we announced an agreement to acquire github inc for 75 billion these acquisitions and other transactions and arrangements involve significant challenges and risks including that they do not advance our business strategy that we get an unsatisfactory return on our investment that we have difficulty integrating and retaining new employees business systems and technology or that they distract management from our other businesses if an arrangement fails to adequately anticipate changing circumstances and interests of a party it may result in early termination or renegotiation of the arrangement the success of these transactions and arrangements will depend in part on our ability to leverage them to enhance our existing products and services or develop compelling new ones it may take longer than expected to realize the full benefits from these transactions and arrangements such as increased revenue enhanced efficiencies or increased market share or the benefits may ultimately be smaller than we expected these events could adversely affect our operating results or financial condition 

if our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets become impaired we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings we acquire other companies and intangible assets and may not realize all the economic benefit from those acquisitions which could cause an impairment of goodwill or intangibles we review our amortizable intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable we test goodwill for impairment at least annually factors that may be a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets may not be recoverable include a decline in our stock price and market capitalization reduced future cash flow estimates and slower growth rates in industry segments in which we participate we have in the past recorded and may in the future be required to record a significant charge in our consolidated financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets is determined negatively affecting our results of operations our acquisition of linkedin resulted in a significant increase in our goodwill and intangible asset balances 

we may not earn the revenues we expect from our intellectual property rights 

we may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property rights 

protecting our intellectual property rights and combating unlicensed copying and use of our software and other intellectual property on a global basis is difficult while piracy adversely affects us revenue the impact on revenue from outside the us is more significant particularly countries in which the legal system provides less protection for intellectual property rights our revenue in these markets may grow more slowly than the underlying device market similarly the absence of harmonized patent laws makes it more difficult to ensure consistent respect for patent rights throughout the world we educate users about the benefits of licensing genuine products and obtaining indemnification benefits for intellectual property risks and we educate lawmakers about the advantages of a business climate where intellectual property rights are protected reductions in the legal protection for software intellectual property rights could adversely affect revenue

item 1a

 

we may not receive expected royalties from our patent licenses 

we expend significant resources to patent the intellectual property we create with the expectation that we will generate revenues by incorporating that intellectual property in our products or services or in some instances by licensing our patents to others in return for a royalty changes in the law may continue to weaken our ability to prevent the use of patented technology or collect revenue for licensing our patents these include legislative changes and regulatory actions that make it more difficult to obtain injunctions and the increasing use of legal process to challenge issued patents similarly licensees of our patents may fail to satisfy their obligations to pay us royalties or may contest the scope and extent of their obligations finally the royalties we can obtain to monetize our intellectual property may decline because of the evolution of technology selling price changes in products using licensed patents or the difficulty of discovering infringements finally our increasing engagement with open source software will also cause us to license our intellectual property rights broadly in certain situations and may negatively impact revenue

third parties may claim we infringe their intellectual property rights from time to time others claim we infringe their intellectual property rights the number of these claims may grow because of constant technological change in the markets in which we compete the extensive patent coverage of existing technologies the rapid rate of issuance of new patents and our offering of firstparty devices such as microsoft surface to resolve these claims we may enter into royalty and licensing agreements on terms that are less favorable than currently available stop selling or redesign affected products or services or pay damages to satisfy indemnification commitments with our customers these outcomes may cause operating margins to decline besides money damages in some jurisdictions plaintiffs can seek injunctive relief that may limit or prevent importing marketing and selling our products or services that have infringing technologies in some countries such as germany an injunction can be issued before the parties have fully litigated the validity of the underlying patents we have paid significant amounts to settle claims related to the use of technology and intellectual property rights and to procure intellectual property rights as part of our strategy to manage this risk and may continue to do so 

we may not be able to protect our source code from copying if there is an unauthorized disclosure source code the detailed program commands for our operating systems and other software programs is critical to our business although we license portions of our application and operating system source code to several licensees we take significant measures to protect the secrecy of large portions of our source code if our source code leaks we might lose future trade secret protection for that code it may then become easier for third parties to compete with our products by copying functionality which could adversely affect our revenue and operating margins unauthorized disclosure of source code also could increase the security risks described in the next paragraph 

cyberattacks and security vulnerabilities could lead to reduced revenue increased costs liability claims or harm to our reputation or competitive position 

security of our information technology 

threats to it security can take a variety of forms individual and groups of hackers and sophisticated organizations including statesponsored organizations or nationstates continuously undertake attacks that pose threats to our customers and our it these actors may use a wide variety of methods which may include developing and deploying malicious software or exploiting vulnerabilities in hardware software or other infrastructure in order to attack our products and services or gain access to our networks and datacenters using social engineering techniques to induce our employees users partners or customers to disclose passwords or other sensitive information or take other actions to gain access to our data or our users’ or customers’ data or acting in a coordinated manner to launch distributed denial of service or other coordinated attacks inadequate account security practices may also result in unauthorized access to confidential data for example system administrators may fail to timely remove employee account access when no longer appropriate employees or third parties may intentionally compromise our or our users’ security or systems or reveal confidential information

item 1a

 

cyberthreats are constantly evolving increasing the difficulty of detecting and successfully defending against them we may have no current capability to detect certain vulnerabilities which may allow them to persist in the environment over long periods of time cyberthreats can have cascading impacts that unfold with increasing speed across our internal networks and systems and those of our partners and customers breaches of our facilities network  or data secur ity could disrupt the security of our systems and business applications impair our ability to provide services to our customers and protect the privacy of their dat a result in product development delays compromise confidential or technical business information harming our reputation or competitive position result in theft or misuse of our intellectual property or other assets require us to allocate more resources to improved technologies or otherwise adversely affect our business 

in addition our internal it environment continues to evolve often we are early adopters of new devices and technologies we embrace new ways of sharing data and communicating internally and with partners and customers using methods such as social networking and other consumeroriented technologies our business policies and internal security controls may not keep pace with these changes as new threats emerge 

security of our products services devices and customers’ data 

the security of our products and services is important in our customers’ decisions to purchase or use our products or services security threats are a significant challenge to companies like us whose business is providing technology products and services to others threats to our own it infrastructure can also affect our customers customers using our cloudbased services rely on the security of our infrastructure including hardware and other elements provided by third parties to ensure the reliability of our services and the protection of their data adversaries tend to focus their efforts on the most popular operating systems programs and services including many of ours and we expect that to continue adversaries that acquire user account information at other companies can use that information to compromise our users’ accounts where accounts share the same attributes like passwords inadequate account security practices may also result in unauthorized access we are also increasingly incorporating open source software into our products there may be vulnerabilities in open source software that may make our products susceptible to cyberattacks 

to defend against security threats to our internal it systems our cloudbased services and our customers’ systems we must continuously engineer more secure products and services enhance security and reliability features improve the deployment of software updates to address security vulnerabilities in our own products as well as those provided by others develop mitigation technologies that help to secure customers from attacks even when software updates are not deployed maintain the digital security infrastructure that protects the integrity of our network products and services and provide customers security tools such as firewalls and antivirus software and information about the need to deploy security measures and the impact of doing so 

the cost of these steps could reduce our operating margins if we fail to do these things well actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products and services data corruption issues or reduced performance could harm our reputation and lead customers to reduce or delay future purchases of products or subscriptions to services or to use competing products or services customers may also spend more on protecting their existing computer systems from attack which could delay adoption of additional products or services customers may fail to update their systems continue to run software or operating systems we no longer support or may fail timely to install or enable security patches any of these actions by customers could adversely affect our reputation and revenue actual or perceived vulnerabilities may lead to claims against us our license agreements typically contain provisions that eliminate or limit our exposure to liability but there is no assurance these provisions will withstand legal challenges at times to achieve commercial objectives we may enter into agreements with larger liability exposure to customers 

as illustrated by the recent spectre and meltdown threats our products operate in conjunction with and are dependent on products and components across a broad ecosystem if there is a security vulnerability in one of these components and if there is a security exploit targeting it we could face increased costs liability claims reduced revenue or harm to our reputation or competitive position

disclosure and misuse of personal data could result in liability and harm our reputation as we continue to grow the number and scale of our cloudbased offerings we store and process increasingly large amounts of personally identifiable information of our customers and users the continued occurrence of h ighprofile data breaches provides evidence of an external environment increasingly hostile to information security despite our efforts to improve the security controls across our business groups and geographies it is possible our security controls over personal data our training of employees and vendors on data security and other practices we follow may not prevent the improper disclosure of customer or user data we or our vendors store and manage in addition third parties who have limited access to our customer or user data may use this data in unauthorized ways improper disclosure or misuse could harm our reputation lead to legal exposure to customers or users or subject us to liability under laws that protect personal data resulting in increase d costs or loss of revenue our software products and services also enable our customers and users to store and process personal data onpremises or increasingly in a cloudbased environment we host government authorities can sometimes require us to pro duce customer or user data in response to valid legal orders in the us and elsewhere we advocate for transparency concerning these requests and appropriate limitations on government authority to compel disclosure despite our efforts to protect custome r and user data perceptions that the collection use and retention of personal information is not satisfactorily protected could inhibit sales of our products or services and could limit adoption of our cloudbased solutions by consumers businesses an d government entities additional security measures we may take to address customer or user concerns or constraints on our flexibility to determine where and how to operate datacenters in response to customer or user expectations or governmental rules or actions may cause higher operating expenses or hinder growth of our products and services 

we may not be able to protect information in our products and services from use by others  linkedin and other microsoft products and services contain valuable information and content protected by contractual restrictions or technical measures in certain cases we have made commitments to our members and users to limit access to or use of this information changes in the law or interpretations of the law may weaken our ability to prevent third parties from scraping or gathering information or content through use of bots or other measures and using it for their own benefit thus diminishing the value of our products and services 

abuse of our advertising or social platforms may harm our reputation or user engagement for linkedin bing ads and other products and services that provide content or host ads that come from or can be influenced by third parties our reputation or user engagement may be negatively affected by activity that is hostile or inappropriate to other people by users impersonating other people or organizations by use of our products or services to disseminate information that may be viewed as misleading or intended to manipulate the opinions of our users or by the use of our products or services that violates our terms of service or otherwise for objectionable or illegal ends preventing these actions may require us to make substantial investments in people and technology and these investments may not be successful adversely affecting our business and financial results 

we may have excessive outages data losses and disruptions of our online services if we fail to maintain an adequate operations infrastructure our increasing user traffic growth in services and the complexity of our products and services demand more computing power we spend substantial amounts to build purchase or lease datacenters and equipment and to upgrade our technology and network infrastructure to handle more traffic on our websites and in our datacenters these demands continue to increase as we introduce new products and services and support the growth of existing services such as bing exchange online azure microsoft account services office 365 onedrive sharepoint online skype xbox live outlookcom and windows stores we are rapidly growing our business of providing a platform and backend hosting for services provided by third parties to their end users maintaining securing and expanding this infrastructure is expensive and complex it requires that we maintain an internet connectivity infrastructure that is robust and reliable within competitive and regulatory constraints that continue to evolve inefficiencies or operational failures including temporary or permanent loss of customer data or insufficient internet connectivity could diminish the quality of our products services and user experience resulting in contractual liability claims by customers and other third parties regulatory actions damage to our reputation and loss of current and potential users subscribers and advertisers each of which may harm our operating results and financial condition

government litigation and regulatory activity relating to competition rules may limit how we design and market our products as a leading global software and device maker government agencies closely scrutinize us under us and foreign competition laws an increasing number of governments are actively enforc ing competition laws and regulations and this includes increased scrutiny in potentially large markets such as the european union “eu” the us and china some jurisdictions also allow competitors or consumers to assert claims of anticompetitive condu ct us federal and state antitrust authorities have previously brought enforcement actions and continue to scrutinize our business 

the european commission “the commission” closely scrutinizes the design of highvolume microsoft products and the terms on which we make certain technologies used in these products such as file formats programming interfaces and protocols available to other companies flagship product releases such as windows 10 can receive significant scrutiny under competition laws for example in 2004 the commission ordered us to create new versions of our windows operating system that do not include certain multimedia technologies and to provide our competitors with specifications for how to implement certain proprietary windows communications protocols in their own products in 2009 the commission accepted a set of commitments we offered to address the commission’s concerns relating to competition in web browsing software including an undertaking to address commission concerns relating to interoperability the web browsing commitments expired in 2014 the remaining obligations may limit our ability to innovate in windows or other products in the future diminish the developer appeal of the windows platform and increase our product development costs the availability of licenses related to protocols and file formats may enable competitors to develop software products that better mimic the functionality of our products which could hamper sales of our products 

our portfolio of firstparty devices continues to grow at the same time our oem partners offer a large variety of devices on our platforms as a result increasingly we both cooperate and compete with our oem partners creating a risk that we fail to do so in compliance with competition rules regulatory scrutiny in this area may increase certain foreign governments particularly in china and other countries in asia have advanced arguments under their competition laws that exert downward pressure on royalties for our intellectual property 

government regulatory actions and court decisions such as these may result in fines or hinder our ability to provide the benefits of our software to consumers and businesses reducing the attractiveness of our products and the revenue that come from them new competition law actions could be initiated potentially using previous actions as precedent the outcome of such actions or steps taken to avoid them could adversely affect us in a variety of ways including

our global operations subje ct us to potential liability under anticorruption trade protection and other laws and regulations the foreign corrupt practices act and other anticorruption laws and regulations “anticorruption laws” prohibit corrupt payments by our employees vend ors or agents from time to time we receive inquiries from authorities in the us and elsewhere and reports from employees and others about our business activities outside the us and our compliance with anticorruption laws specifically we have been cooperating with authorities in the us in connection with reports concerning our compliance with the foreign corrupt practices act in various countries most countries in which we operate also have competition laws that prohibit competitors from colludi ng or otherwise attempting to reduce competition between themselves while we devote substantial resources to our global compliance programs and have implemented policies training and internal controls designed to reduce the risk of corrupt payments and collusive activity  our employees vendors or agents may violate our policies our failure to comply with anticorruption laws or competition laws could result in significant fines and penalties criminal sanctions against us our officers or our employe es prohibitions on the conduct of our business and damage to our reputation operations outside the us may be affected by changes in trade protection laws policies and measures sanctions and other regulatory requirements affecting trade and investm ent we may be subject to legal liability and reputational damage if we sell goods or services in violation of us trade sanctions on countries such as iran north korea cuba sudan and syria 

other regulatory areas that may apply to our products and online services offerings include user privacy telecommunications data storage and protection and online content for example regulators may take the position that our offerings such as skype are covered by existing laws regulating telecommunications services and new laws may define more of our services as regulated telecommunications services data protection authorities may assert that our collection use and management of customer data is inconsistent with their laws and regulations legislative or regulatory action relating cybersecurity requirements may increase the costs to develop implement or secure our products and services legislative or regulatory action could also emerge in the area of ai increasing costs or restricting opportunity applying these laws and regulations to our business is often unclear subject to change over time and sometimes may conflict from jurisdiction to jurisdiction additionally these laws and governments’ approach to their enforcement and our products and services are continuing to evolve compliance with these types of regulation may involve significant costs or require changes in products or business practices that result in reduced revenue noncompliance could result in the imposition of penalties or orders we stop the alleged noncompliant activity 

we strive to empower all people and organizations to achieve more and accessibility of our products is an important aspect of this goal there is increasing pressure from advocacy groups regulators competitors and customers to make technology more accessible if our products do not meet customer expectations or emerging global accessibility requirements we could lose sales opportunities or face regulatory actions

laws and regulations relating to the handling of personal data may impede the adoption of our services or result in increased costs legal claims fines against us or reputational damage the growth of our internet and cloudbased services internationally relies increasingly on the movement of data across national boundaries legal requirements relating to the collection storage handling and transfer of personal data continue to evolve for example the eu and the us formally entered into a new framework in july 2016 that provides a mechanism for companies to transfer data from eu member states to the us this framework called the privacy shield is intended to address shortcomings identified by the european court of justice in a predecessor mechanism the privacy shield and other mechanisms are currently subject to challenges in european courts which may lead to uncertainty about the legal basis for data transfers across the atlantic the privacy shield and other potential rules on the flow of data across borders could increase the cost and complexity of delivering our products and services in some markets in may 2018 a new eu law governing data practices and privacy the general data protection regulation “gdpr” became effective the law which applies to all of our activities conducted from an establishment in the eu or related to products and services offered in the eu imposes a range of new compliance obligations regarding the handling of personal data engineering efforts to build new capabilities to facilitate compliance with the law have entailed substantial expense and the diversion of engineering resources from other projects and may continue to do so we might experience reduced demand for our offerings if we are unable to engineer products that meet our legal duties or help our customers meet their obligations under the gdpr or other data regulations or if the changes we implement to comply with the gdpr make our offerings less attractive the gdpr imposes significant new obligations and compliance with these obligations depends in part on how particular regulators apply and interpret them if we fail to comply with the gdpr or if regulators assert we have failed to comply with the gdpr it may lead to regulatory enforcement actions which can result in monetary penalties of up to 4 of worldwide revenue private lawsuits or reputational damage

our business depends on our ability to attract and retain talented employees our business is based on successfully attracting and retaining talented employees the market for highly skilled workers and leaders in our industry is extremely competitive maintaining our brand and reputation are important to our ability to recruit and retain employees we are also limited in our ability to recruit internationally by restrictive domestic immigration laws changes to us immigration policies that restrain the flow of technical and professional talent may inhibit our ability to adequately staff our research and development efforts if we are less successful in our recruiting efforts or if we cannot retain highly skilled workers and key leaders our ability to develop and deliver successful products and services may be adversely affected effective succession planning is also important to our longterm success failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution how employmentrelated laws are interpreted and applied to our workforce practices may result in increased operating costs and less flexibility in how we meet our workforce needs 

we have claims and lawsuits against us that may result in adverse outcomes we are subject to a variety of claims and lawsuits these claims may arise from a wide variety of business practices and initiatives including major new product releases such as windows 10 significant business transactions warranty or product claims and employment practices adverse outcomes in some or all of these claims may result in significant monetary damages or injunctive relief that could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business the litigation and other claims are subject to inherent uncertainties and management’s view of these matters may change in the future a material adverse impact in our consolidated financial statements could occur for the period in which the effect of an unfavorable outcome becomes probable and reasonably estimable 

we may have additional tax liabilities we are subject to income taxes in the us and many foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes in the course of our business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain for example compliance with the 2017 united states tax cut and jobs act “tcja” may require the collection of information not regularly produced within the company the use of estimates in our financial statements and the exercise of significant judgment in accounting for its provisions as regulations and guidance evolve with respect to tcja and as we gather more information and perform more analysis our results may differ from previous estimates and may materially affect our financial position 

we regularly are under audit by tax authorities in different jurisdictions economic and political pressures to increase tax revenue in various jurisdictions may make resolving tax disputes favorably more difficult although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation in the jurisdictions where we are subject to taxation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals the results of an audit or litigation could have a material effect in our consolidated financial statements in the period or periods in which that determination is made 

we earn a significant amount of our operating income outside the us a change in the mix of earnings and losses in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in our business or structure or the expiration of or disputes about certain tax agreements in a particular country may result in higher effective tax rates for the company in addition changes in us federal and state or international tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals other fundamental law changes currently being considered by many countries including in the us and changes in taxing jurisdictions’ administrative interpretations decisions policies and positions may materially adversely impact our tax expense and cash flows

we may experience quality or supply problems our hardware products such as xbox consoles surface devices and other devices we design manufacture and market are highly complex and can have defects in design manufacture or associated software we could incur significant expenses lost revenue and r eputational harm as a result of recalls safety alerts or product liability claims if we fail to prevent detect or address such issues through design testing or warranty repairs 

our software products also may experience quality or reliability problems the highlysophisticated software products we develop may contain bugs and other defects that interfere with their intended operation any defects we do not detect and fix in prerelease testing could cause reduced sales and revenue damage to our reputation repair or remediation costs delays in the release of new products or versions or legal liability although our license agreements typically contain provisions that eliminate or limit our exposure to liability there is no assurance these provisions will withstand legal challenge

we acquire some device and datacenter components from sole suppliers our competitors use some of the same suppliers and their demand for hardware components can affect the capacity available to us if a component from a solesource supplier is delayed or becomes unavailable whether because of supplier capacity constraint industry shortages legal or regulatory changes or other reasons we may not obtain timely replacement supplies resulting in reduced sales or inadequate datacenter capacity component shortages excess or obsolete inventory or price reductions resulting in inventory adjustments may increase our cost of revenue xbox consoles surface devices datacenter servers and other hardware are assembled in asia and other geographies that may be subject to disruptions in the supply chain resulting in shortages that would affect our revenue and operating margins these same risks would apply to any other hardware and software products we may offer 

our global business exposes us to operational and economic risks our customers are located in over 200 countries and a significant part of our revenue comes from international sales the global nature of our business creates operational and economic risks our results of operations may be affected by global regional and local economic developments monetary policy inflation and recession as well as political and military disputes in addition our international growth strategy includes certain markets the developing nature of which presents several risks including deterioration of social political labor or economic conditions in a country or region and difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations emerging nationalist trends in specific countries may significantly alter the trade environment changes to trade policy or agreements as a result of populism protectionism or economic nationalism may result in higher tariffs local sourcing initiatives or other developments that make it more difficult to sell our products in foreign countries disruptions of these kinds in developed or emerging markets could negatively impact demand for our products and services or increase operating costs although we hedge a portion of our international currency exposure significant fluctuations in foreign exchange rates between the us dollar and foreign currencies may adversely affect our revenue 

catastrophic events or geopolitical conditions may disrupt our business a disruption or failure of our systems or operations because of a major earthquake weather event cyberattack terrorist attack or other catastrophic event could cause delays in completing sales providing services or performing other critical functions our corporate headquarters a significant portion of our research and development activities and certain other essential business operations are in the seattle washington area and we have other business operations in the silicon valley area of california both of which are seismically active regions a catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our critical business or it systems could harm our ability to conduct normal business operations providing our customers with more services and solutions in the cloud puts a premium on the resilience of our systems and strength of our business continuity management plans and magnifies the potential impact of prolonged service outages on our operating results

our product distribution system relies on an extensive partner and retail network oems building devices that run our software have also been a significant means of distribution the impact of economic conditions on our partners such as the bankruptcy of a major distributor oem or retailer could cause sales channel disruption 

challenging economic conditions also may impair the ability of our customers to pay for products and services they have purchased as a result allowances for doubtful accounts and writeoffs of accounts receivable may increase 

we maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings types and maturities these investments are subject to general credit liquidity market and interest rate risks which may be exacerbated by market downturns or events that affect global financial markets a significant part of our investment portfolio comprises us government securities if global financial markets decline for long periods or if there is a downgrade of the us government credit rating due to an actual or threatened default on government debt our investment portfolio may be adversely affected and we could determine that more of our investments have experienced an otherthantemporary decline in fair value requiring impairment charges that could adversely affect our financial results 

changes in our sales organization may impact revenues in july 2017 we announced plans to reorganize our global sales organization to help enable customers’ digital transformation add greater technical ability to our sales force and create pooled resources that can be used across countries and industries the reorganization is the most significant change in our global sales organization in our history involving employees changing roles adding additional talent realigning teams and onboarding new partners successfully executing these changes will be a significant factor in enabling future revenue growth as we continue to navigate through this transition sales profitability and cash flow could be adversely impacted

economic conditions challenges and risks 

the markets for software devices and cloudbased services are dynamic and highly competitive our competitors are developing new software and devices while also deploying competing cloudbased services for consumers and businesses the devices and form factors customers prefer evolve rapidly and influence how users access services in the cloud and in some cases the user’s choice of which suite of cloudbased services to use we must continue to evolve and adapt over an extended time in pace with this changing environment the investments we are making in infrastructure and devices will continue to increase our operating costs and may decrease our operating margins

the tcja was effective in the second quarter of fiscal year 2018 as of june 30 2018 we have not completed our accounting for the estimated tax effects of the tcja during fiscal year 2018 we recorded a provisional net charge of 137 billion related to the tcja based on reasonable estimates for those tax effects due to the timing of the enactment and the complexity in applying the provisions of the tcja the provisional net charge is subject to revisions as we continue to complete our analysis of the tcja collect and prepare necessary data and interpret any additional guidance issued by the us treasury department internal revenue service “irs” financial accounting standards board and other standardsetting and regulatory bodies adjustments may materially impact our provision for income taxes and effective tax rate in the period in which the adjustments are made our accounting for the estimated tax effects of the tcja will be completed during the measurement period which is not expected to extend beyond one year from the enactment date 

during fiscal year 2018 we recorded an estimated net charge of 137 billion related to the tcja due to the impact of the onetime transition tax on the deemed repatriation of deferred foreign income of 179 billion offset in part by the impact of changes in the tax rate of 42 billion primarily on deferred tax assets and liabilities

uncertain tax positions

while we settled a portion of the irs audit for tax years 2004 to 2006 during the third quarter of fiscal year 2011 and a portion of the irs audit for tax years 2007 to 2009 during the first quarter of fiscal year 2016 we remain under audit for those years in the second quarter of fiscal year 2018 we settled a portion of the irs audit for tax years 2010 to 2013 we continue to be subject to examination by the irs for tax years 2010 to 2017 in february 2012 the irs withdrew its 2011 revenue agents report for tax years 2004 to 2006 and reopened the audit phase of the examination as of june 30 2018 the primary unresolved issue relates to transfer pricing which could have a significant impact in our consolidated financial statements if not resolved favorably we believe our allowances for income tax contingencies are adequate we have not received a proposed assessment for the unresolved issues and do not expect a final resolution of these issues in the next 12 months based on the information currently available we do not anticipate a significant increase or decrease to our tax contingencies for these issues within the next 12 months

we are subject to income tax in many jurisdictions outside the us our operations in certain jurisdictions remain subject to examination for tax years 1996 to 2017 some of which are currently under audit by local tax authorities the resolution of each of these audits is not expected to be material to our consolidated financial statements

nongaap financial measures 

adjusted operating income net income and diluted earnings per share are nongaap financial measures which exclude the net charge related to the tcja and impairment and restructuring expenses we believe these nongaap measures aid investors by providing additional insight into our operational performance and help clarify trends affecting our business for comparability of reporting management considers nongaap measures in conjunction with gaap financial results in evaluating business performance these nongaap financial measures presented should not be considered a substitute for or superior to the measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with gaap

financial condition 

cash cash equivalents and investments 

cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments totaled 1338 billion and 1330 billion as of june 30 2018 and 2017 respectively equity and other investments were 19 billion and 60 billion as of june 30 2018 and 2017 respectively our shortterm investments are primarily intended to facilitate liquidity and capital preservation they consist predominantly of highly liquid investmentgrade fixedincome securities diversified among industries and individual issuers the investments are predominantly us dollardenominated securities but also include foreign currencydenominated securities to diversify risk our fixedincome investments are exposed to interest rate risk and credit risk the credit risk and average maturity of our fixedincome portfolio are managed to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain fixedincome indices the settlement risk related to these investments is insignificant given that the shortterm investments held are primarily highly liquid investmentgrade fixedincome securities 

as a result of the tcja our cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments held by foreign subsidiaries are no longer subject to us tax on repatriation into the us

valuation 

in general and where applicable we use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities to determine the fair value of our financial instruments this pricing methodology applies to our level 1 investments such as us government securities common and preferred stock and mutual funds if quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities are not available to determine fair value then we use quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities or inputs other than the quoted prices that are observable either directly or indirectly this pricing methodology applies to our level 2 investments such as corporate notes and bonds foreign government bonds mortgage and assetbacked securities commercial paper certificates of deposit and us agency securities level 3 investments are valued using internally developed models with unobservable inputs assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis using unobservable inputs are an immaterial portion of our portfolio 

part ii 

item 7

 

a majority of our investment s are priced by pricing vendors and are generally level 1 or level 2 investments as these vendors either provide a quoted market price in an active market or use observable inputs for their pricing without applying significant adjustments broker pricing i s used mainly when a quoted price is not available the investment is not priced by our pricing vendors or when a broker price is more reflective of fair values in the market in which the investment trades our brokerpriced investments are generally clas sified as level 2 investments because the broker prices these investments based on similar assets without applying significant adjustments in addition all our brokerpriced investments have a sufficient level of trading volume to demonstrate that the fai r values used are appropriate for these investments our fair value processes include controls that are designed to ensure appropriate fair values are recorded these controls include model validation review of key model inputs analysis of periodoverpe riod fluctuations and independent recalculation of prices where appropriate 

cash flows 

fiscal year 2018 compared with fiscal year 2017 

cash from operations increased 44 billion to 439 billion for the fiscal year ended june 30 2018 mainly due to an increase in cash received from customers offset in part by an increase in cash paid to employees net cash paid for income taxes cash paid for interest on debt and cash paid to suppliers cash used in financing was 336 billion for the fiscal year ended june 30 2018 compared to cash from financing of 84 billion for the fiscal year ended june 30 2017 the change was mainly due to a 417 billion decrease in proceeds from issuance of debt net of repayments offset in part by a 11 billion decrease in cash used for common stock repurchases cash used in investing decreased 407 billion to 61 billion for the fiscal year ended june 30 2018 mainly due to a  25 1 billion decrease in cash used for acquisitions of companies net of cash acquired and purchases of intangible and other assets and a 191 billion increase in cash from net investment purchases sales and maturities

fiscal year 2017 compared with fiscal year 2016 

cash from operations increased 62 billion to 395 billion during the fiscal year mainly due to an increase in cash received from customers and an income tax refund for overpayment of estimated taxes offset in part by an increase in cash paid to employees cash from financing increased 168 billion to 84 billion mainly due to a 132 billion increase in proceeds from issuances of debt net of repayments and a 42 billion decrease in cash used for common stock repurchases offset in part by an 839 million increase in dividends paid cash used in investing increased 228 billion to 468 billion mainly due to a 246 billion increase in cash used for acquisitions of companies net of cash acquired and purchases of intangibles and other assets offset in part by a 19 billion decrease in cash used for net investment purchases sales and maturities 

debt 

we issued debt to take advantage of favorable pricing and liquidity in the debt markets reflecting our credit rating and the low interest rate environment the proceeds of these issuances were or will be used for general corporate purposes which may include among other things funding for working capital capital expenditures repurchases of capital stock acquisitions and repayment of existing debt refer to note 12 – debt of the notes to financial statements part ii item 8 of this form 10k for further discussion

unearned revenue 

unearned revenue comprises mainly unearned revenue related to volume licensing programs and includes software assurance “sa” and cloud services unearned revenue is generally billed upfront at the beginning of each annual coverage period for multiyear agreements and recognized ratably over the coverage period unearned revenue also includes payments for other offerings for which we have been paid in advance and earn the revenue when we transfer control of the product or service refer to note 1 – accounting policies of the notes to financial statements part ii item 8 of this form 10k for further discussion

item 7

 

the following table outlines the expected future recognition of unearned revenue as of june 30 2018 

 



if our customers choose to license cloudbased versions of our products and services rather than licensing transactionbased products and services the associated revenue will shift from being recognized at the time of the transaction to being recognized over the subscription period or upon consumption as applicable 

share repurchases 

for the fiscal years ended june 30 2018 2017 and 2016 we repurchased 99 million shares 170 million shares and 294 million shares of our common stock for 86 billion 103 billion and 148 billion respectively through our share repurchase programs all repurchases were made using cash resources refer to note 18 – stockholders’ equity of the notes to financial statements part ii item 8 of this form 10k for further discussion

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we provide indemnifications of varying scope and size to certain customers against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products and certain other matters additionally we have agreed to cover damages resulting from breaches of certain security and privacy commitments in our cloud business in evaluating estimated losses on these obligations we consider factors such as the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and our ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss these obligations did not have a material impact in our consolidated financial statements during the periods presented 

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes the payments due by fiscal year for our outstanding contractual obligations as of june 30 2018

other planned uses of capital 

we will continue to invest in sales marketing product support infrastructure and existing and advanced areas of technology as well as continue making acquisitions that align with our business strategy additions to property and equipment will continue including new facilities datacenters and computer systems for research and development sales and marketing support and administrative staff we expect capital expenditures to increase in coming years to support growth in our cloud offerings we have operating and finance leases for datacenters corporate offices research and development facilities retail stores and certain equipment we have not engaged in any related party transactions or arrangements with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect liquidity or the availability of capital resources 

liquidity 

as a result of the tcja we are required to pay a onetime transition tax of 179 billion on deferred foreign income not previously subject to us income tax in fiscal year 2018 we paid transition tax of 228 million under the tcja the remaining transition tax of 176 billion is payable interestfree over eight years with 8 due in each of the first five years 15 in year six 20 in year seven and 25 in year eight 

we expect existing cash cash equivalents shortterm investments cash flows from operations and access to capital markets to continue to be sufficient to fund our operating activities and cash commitments for investing and financing activities such as dividends share repurchases debt maturities material capital expenditures and the transition tax related to the tcja for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future 

recent accounting guidance 

refer to note 1 – accounting policies of the notes to financial statements part ii item 8 of this form 10k for further discussion

application of critical accounting policies 

our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with gaap preparing consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses these estimates and assumptions are affected by management’s application of accounting policies critical accounting policies for us include revenue recognition impairment of investment securities goodwill research and development costs contingencies income taxes and inventories 

revenue recognition 

our contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer determining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together may require significant judgment when a cloudbased service includes both onpremises software licenses and cloud services judgment is required to determine whether the software license is considered distinct and accounted for separately or not distinct and accounted for together with the cloud service and recognized over time certain cloud services primarily office 365 depend on a significant level of integration interdependency and interrelation between the desktop applications and cloud services and are accounted for together as one performance obligation revenue from office 365 is recognized ratably over the period in which the cloud services are provided 

part ii 

item 7

 

judgment is required to determine the standalone selling price “ssp for each distinct performance oblig ation we use a single amount to estimate ssp for items that are not sold separately including onpremises licenses sold with sa or software updates provided at no additional charge we use a range of amounts to estimate ssp when we sell each of the produ cts and services separately and need to determine whether there is a discount to be allocated based on the relative ssp of the various products and services 

in instances where ssp is not directly observable such as when we do not sell the product or service separately we determine the ssp using information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs we typically have more than one ssp for individual products and services due to the stratification of those products and services by customers and circumstances in these instances we may use information such as the size of the customer and geographic region in determining the ssp 

due to the various benefits from and the nature of our sa program judgment is required to assess the pattern of delivery including the exercise pattern of certain benefits across our portfolio of customers 

our products are generally sold with a right of return we may provide other credits or incentives and in certain instances we estimate customer usage of our products and services which are accounted for as variable consideration when determining the amount of revenue to recognize returns and credits are estimated at contract inception and updated at the end of each reporting period if additional information becomes available changes to our estimated variable consideration were not material for the periods presented

the new standard related to revenue recognition had a material impact in our consolidated financial statements refer to note 1 – accounting policies of the notes to financial statements part ii item 8 of this form 10k for further discussion 

impairment of investment securities 

we review investments quarterly for indicators of otherthantemporary impairment this determination requires significant judgment in making this judgment we employ a systematic methodology quarterly that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments if the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value we evaluate among other factors general market conditions credit quality of debt instrument issuers the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost and for equity securities our intent and ability to hold or plans to sell the investment for fixedincome securities we also evaluate whether we have plans to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery we also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the investee including industry and sector performance changes in technology and operational and financing cash flow factors once a decline in fair value is determined to be otherthantemporary an impairment charge is recorded to other income expense net and a new cost basis in the investment is established if market industry andor investee conditions deteriorate we may incur future impairments 

goodwill 

we allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the business combination we evaluate our reporting units on an annual basis and if necessary reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level operating segment or one level below an operating segment on an annual basis may 1 for us and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value these events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate legal factors operating performance indicators competition or sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit 

application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment including the identification of reporting units assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units assignment of goodwill to reporting units and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit the fair value of each reporting unit is estimated primarily through the use of a discounted cash flow methodology this analysis requires significant judgments including estimation of future cash flows which is dependent on internal forecasts estimation of the longterm rate of growth for our business estimation of the useful life over which cash flows will occur and determination of our weighted average cost of capital 

part ii 

item 7

 

the estimates used to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit change from year to year based on operating results market conditions and other factors changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and goodwill impairment for each reporting unit 

research and development costs 

costs incurred internally in researching and developing a computer software product are charged to expense until technological feasibility has been established for the product once technological feasibility is established all software costs are capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers judgment is required in determining when technological feasibility of a product is established we have determined that technological feasibility for our software products is reached after all highrisk development issues have been resolved through coding and testing generally this occurs shortly before the products are released to production the amortization of these costs is included in cost of revenue over the estimated life of the products 

legal and other contingencies 

the outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought against us are subject to significant uncertainty an estimated loss from a loss contingency such as a legal proceeding or claim is accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated in determining whether a loss should be accrued we evaluate among other factors the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss changes in these factors could materially impact our consolidated financial statements

income taxes 

the objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity’s financial statements or tax returns we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement accounting literature also provides guidance on derecognition of income tax assets and liabilities classification of deferred income tax assets and liabilities accounting for interest and penalties associated with tax positions and income tax disclosures judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our consolidated financial statements 

the tcja significantly changes existing us tax law and includes numerous provisions that affect our business refer to note 13 – income taxes of the notes to financial statements part ii item 8 of this form 10k for further discussion

inventories 

inventories are stated at average cost subject to the lower of cost or net realizable value cost includes materials labor and manufacturing overhead related to the purchase and production of inventories net realizable value is the estimated selling price less estimated costs of completion disposal and transportation we regularly review inventory quantities on hand future purchase commitments with our suppliers and the estimated utility of our inventory these reviews include analysis of demand forecasts product life cycle status product development plans current sales levels pricing strategy and component cost trends if our review indicates a reduction in utility below carrying value we reduce our inventory to a new cost basis through a charge to cost of revenue

foreign currency 

certain forecasted transactions assets and liabilities are exposed to foreign currency risk we monitor our foreign currency exposures daily to maximize the economic effectiveness of our foreign currency positions principal currencies hedged include the euro japanese yen british pound canadian dollar and australian dollar 

interest rate 

securities held in our fixedincome portfolio are subject to different interest rate risks based on their maturities we manage the average maturity of the fixedincome portfolio to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain global fixedincome indices 

credit

our fixedincome portfolio is diversified and consists primarily of investmentgrade securities we manage credit exposures relative to broadbased indices and to facilitate portfolio diversification 

equity

securities held in our equity and other investments portfolio are subject to market price risk

sensitivity analysis 

historically we used a valueatrisk “var” model to estimate and quantify our market risks this included presenting oneday var as well as average high and low var by risk category throughout the reporting period given the changes in size and allocation of our portfolio of financial assets we believe sensitivity analysis is more informative in representing the potential impact to the portfolio as a result of market movements therefore we have presented a sensitivity analysis for each risk category below

sensitivity analysis is not intended to represent actual losses in fair value including determinations of otherthantemporary losses in fair value in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america but is used as a risk estimation and management tool

item 1a

 





the competitive pressures described above may cause decreased sales volumes price reductions andor increased operating costs such as for research and development marketing and sales incentives this may lead to lower revenue gross margins and operating income 

our increasing focus on services presents execution and competitive risks a growing part of our business involves cloudbased services available across the spectrum of computing devices our strategic vision is to compete and grow by building bestinclass platforms and productivity services for an intelligent cloud and an intelligent edge infused with ai at the same time our competitors are rapidly developing and deploying cloudbased services for consumers and business customers pricing and delivery models are evolving devices and form factors influence how users access services in the cloud and sometimes the user’s choice of which suite of cloudbased services to use we are devoting significant resources to develop and deploy our cloudbased strategies the windows ecosystem must continue to evolve with this changing environment we are undertaking cultural and organizational changes to drive accountability and eliminate obstacles to innovation the company’s investment in gaining insights from data is becoming central to the value of the services we deliver to customers to our operational efficiency and key opportunities in monetization customer perceptions of quality and operational efficiency our ability to use data in this way may be constrained by regulatory developments that impede realizing the expected return from this investment 

besides software development costs we are incurring costs to build and maintain infrastructure to support cloud computing services these costs will reduce the operating margins we have previously achieved whether we succeed in cloudbased services depends on our execution in several areas including 











it is uncertain whether our strategies will attract the users or generate the revenue required to succeed if we are not effective in executing organizational and technical changes to increase efficiency and accelerate innovation or if we fail to generate sufficient usage of our new products and services we may not grow revenue in line with the infrastructure and development investments described above this may negatively impact gross margins and operating income 

we make significant investments in new products and services that may not achieve expected returns we will continue to make significant investments in research development and marketing for existing products services and technologies including the windows operating system the microsoft office system bing windows server the windows store the microsoft azure services platform office 365 other cloudbased offerings and the xbox entertainment platform we also invest in the development and acquisition of a variety of hardware for productivity communication and entertainment including pcs tablets gaming devices and hololens investments in new technology are speculative commercial success depends on many factors including innovativeness developer support and effective distribution and marketing if customers do not perceive our latest offerings as providing significant new functionality or other value they may reduce their purchases of new software and hardware products or upgrades unfavorably affecting revenue we may not achieve significant revenue from new product service and

distr ibution channel investments for several years if at all new products and services may not be profitable and even if they are profitable operating margins for some new products and businesses will not be as high as the margins we have experienced histor ically 

we did extensive preparation and ongoing compatibility testing for applications and devices to help ensure a positive experience for our users installing windows 10 however negative upgrade experiences could adversely affect the reception of windows 10 in the marketplace and could lead to litigation or regulatory actions by customers and government agencies in addition we anticipate that windows 10 will enable new postlicense monetization opportunities beyond initial license revenues our inability to realize these opportunities to the extent we expect could have an adverse impact on our revenues finally our practices for data collection use and management in windows 10 are subject to regulatory review and may result in decisions directing us to change these practices and imposing fines if so we could face negative public reaction degraded user experiences and reduced flexibility in product design 

developing new technologies is complex it can require long development and testing periods significant delays in new releases or significant problems in creating new products or services could adversely affect our revenue 

acquisitions joint ventures and strategic alliances may have an adverse effect on our business we expect to continue making acquisitions and entering into joint ventures and strategic alliances as part of our longterm business strategy in december 2016 we completed our acquisition of linkedin for 270 billion the linkedin acquisition and other transactions and arrangements involve significant challenges and risks including that they do not advance our business strategy that we get an unsatisfactory return on our investment that we have difficulty integrating and retaining new employees business systems and technology or that they distract management from our other businesses if an arrangement fails to adequately anticipate changing circumstances and interests of a party it may result in early termination or renegotiation of the arrangement the success of these transactions and arrangements will depend in part on our ability to leverage them to enhance our existing products and services or develop compelling new ones it may take longer than expected to realize the full benefits from these transactions and arrangements such as increased revenue enhanced efficiencies or increased market share or the benefits may ultimately be smaller than we expected these events could adversely affect our operating results or financial condition 

if our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets become impaired we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings we acquire other companies and intangible assets and may not realize all the economic benefit from those acquisitions which could cause an impairment of goodwill or intangibles we review our amortizable intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable we test goodwill for impairment at least annually factors that may be a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets may not be recoverable include a decline in our stock price and market capitalization reduced future cash flow estimates and slower growth rates in industry segments in which we participate we may be required to record a significant charge on our consolidated financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets is determined negatively affecting our results of operations for example in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015 we recorded a 51 billion charge for the impairment of goodwill and a 22 billion charge for the impairment of intangible assets and in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016 we recorded a 480 million charge for the impairment of intangible assets the impairment charges for both periods related to our phone business our acquisition of linkedin resulted in a significant increase in our goodwill and intangible asset balances 

we may not earn the revenues we expect from our intellectual property rights 

we may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property rights 

protecting our intellectual property rights and combating unlicensed copying and use of our software and other intellectual property on a global basis is difficult while piracy adversely affects us revenue the impact on revenue from outside the us is more significant particularly in countries where laws are less protective of intellectual property rights our revenue in these markets may grow slower than the underlying device market similarly the absence of harmonized patent laws makes it more difficult to ensure consistent respect for patent rights throughout the world we educate users about the benefits of licensing genuine products and obtaining indemnification benefits for intellectual property risks and we educate lawmakers about the advantages of a business climate where intellectual property rights are protected reductions in the legal protection for software intellectual property rights could adversely affect revenue 

part i 

item 1a

 

we may not receive expected royalties from our patent licenses 

we expend significant resources to patent the intellectual property we create with the expectation that we will generate revenues by incorporating that intellectual property in our products or services or in some instances by licensing our patents to others in return for a royalty changes in the law may weaken our ability to prevent the use of patented technology or collect revenue for licensing our patents these include legislative changes and regulatory actions that make it more difficult to obtain injunctions and the increasing use of legal process to challenge issued patents similarly licensees of our patents may fail to satisfy their obligations to pay us royalties or may contest the scope and extent of their obligations finally the royalties we can obtain to monetize our intellectual property may decline because of the evolution of technology selling price changes in products using licensed patents or the difficulty of discovering infringements

third parties may claim we infringe their intellectual property rights from time to time others claim we infringe their intellectual property rights the number of these claims may grow because of constant technological change in the markets in which we compete the extensive patent coverage of existing technologies the rapid rate of issuance of new patents and our offering of firstparty devices such as surface and lumia phones to resolve these claims we may enter into royalty and licensing agreements on terms that are less favorable than currently available stop selling or redesign affected products or services or pay damages to satisfy indemnification commitments with our customers these outcomes may cause operating margins to decline besides money damages in some jurisdictions plaintiffs can seek injunctive relief that may limit or prevent importing marketing and selling our products or services that have infringing technologies in some countries such as germany an injunction can be issued before the parties have fully litigated the validity of the underlying patents we have paid significant amounts to settle claims related to the use of technology and intellectual property rights and to procure intellectual property rights as part of our strategy to manage this risk and may continue to do so 

we may not be able to protect our source code from copying if there is an unauthorized disclosure of source code source code the detailed program commands for our operating systems and other software programs is critical to our business although we license portions of our application and operating system source code to several licensees we take significant measures to protect the secrecy of large portions of our source code if a significant portion of our source code leaks we might lose future trade secret protection for that source code it may become easier for third parties to compete with our products by copying functionality which could adversely affect our revenue and operating margins unauthorized disclosure of source code also could increase the security risks described in the next paragraph 

cyberattacks and security vulnerabilities could lead to reduced revenue increased costs liability claims or harm to our competitive position 

security of microsoft’s information technology 

threats to it security can take a variety of forms individual and groups of hackers and sophisticated organizations including statesponsored organizations or nationstates continuously undertake attacks that pose threats to our customers and our it these actors may use a wide variety of methods which may include developing and deploying malicious software to attack our products and services and gain access to our networks and datacenters using social engineering techniques to induce our employees users partners or customers to disclose passwords or other sensitive information or take other actions to gain access to our data or our users’ or customers’ data or acting in a coordinated manner to launch distributed denial of service or other coordinated attacks cyber threats are constantly evolving increasing the difficulty of detecting and successfully defending against them cyber threats can have cascading impacts that unfold with increasing speed across our internal networks and systems and those of our partners and customers breaches of our network or data security could disrupt the security of our internal systems and business applications impair our ability to provide services to our customers and protect the privacy of their data result in product development delays compromise confidential or technical business information harming our reputation or competitive position result in theft or misuse of our intellectual property or other assets require us to allocate more resources to improved technologies or otherwise adversely affect our business 

in addition our internal it environment continues to evolve often we are early adopters of new devices and technologies we embrace new ways of sharing data and communicating internally and with partners and customers using methods such as social networking and other consumeroriented technologies our business policies and internal security controls may not keep pace with these changes as new threats emerge

security of our products services devices and customers’ data 

the security of our products and services is important in our customers’ decisions to purchase or use our products or services security threats are a challenge to companies like us whose business is technology products and services threats to our own it infrastructure can also affect our customers customers using our cloudbased services rely on the security of our infrastructure to ensure the reliability of our services and the protection of their data hackers tend to focus their efforts on the most popular operating systems programs and services including many of ours and we expect that to continue hackers that acquire user account information at other companies can use that information to compromise our users’ accounts where accounts share the same attributes like passwords 

to defend against security threats both to our internal it systems and those of our customers we must continuously engineer more secure products and services enhance security and reliability features improve the deployment of software updates to address security vulnerabilities develop mitigation technologies that help to secure customers from attacks even when software updates are not deployed maintain the digital security infrastructure that protects the integrity of our network products and services and provide customers security tools such as firewalls and antivirus software 

the cost of these steps could reduce our operating margins if we fail to do these things well actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products and services could harm our reputation and lead customers to reduce or delay future purchases of products or subscriptions to services or to use competing products or services customers may also spend more on protecting their existing computer systems from attack which could delay adoption of additional products or services customers may fail to update their systems continue to run software or operating systems we no longer support or may fail timely to install security patches any of these actions by customers could adversely affect our revenue actual or perceived vulnerabilities may lead to claims against us although our license agreements typically contain provisions that eliminate or limit our exposure to liability there is no assurance these provisions will withstand legal challenges legislative or regulatory action in these areas may increase the costs to develop implement or secure our products and services 

disclosure of personal data could result in liability and harm our reputation as we continue to grow the number and scale of our cloudbased offerings we store and process increasingly large amounts of personally identifiable information of our customers the continued occurrence of highprofile data breaches provides evidence of an external environment increasingly hostile to information security despite our efforts to improve the security controls across our business groups and geographies it is possible our security controls over personal data our training of employees and vendors on data security and other practices we follow may not prevent the improper disclosure of customer data we or our vendors store and manage improper disclosure could harm our reputation lead to legal exposure to customers or subject us to liability under laws that protect personal data resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue our software products and services also enable our customers to store and process personal data onpremises or increasingly in a cloudbased environment we host government authorities can sometimes require us to produce customer data in response to valid legal orders in the us and elsewhere we advocate for transparency concerning these requests and appropriate limitations on government authority to compel disclosure despite our efforts to protect customer data perceptions that the collection use and retention of personal information is not satisfactorily protected could inhibit sales of our products or services and could limit adoption of our cloudbased solutions by consumers businesses and government entities additional security measures we may take to address customer concerns or constraints on our flexibility to determine where and how to operate datacenters in response to customer expectations or governmental rules or actions may cause higher operating expenses 

we may have outages data losses and disruptions of our online services if we fail to maintain an adequate operations infrastructure our increasing user traffic growth in services and the complexity of our products and services demand more computing power we spend substantial amounts to build purchase or lease datacenters and equipment and to upgrade our technology and network infrastructure to handle more traffic on our websites and in our datacenters these demands continue to increase as we introduce new products and services and support the growth of existing services such as bing exchange online microsoft azure microsoft account services office 365 onedrive sharepoint online skype xbox live outlookcom and windows stores we are rapidly growing our business of providing a platform and backend hosting for services provided by third parties to their end users maintaining securing and expanding this infrastructure is expensive and complex it requires that we maintain an internet connectivity infrastructure that is robust and reliable within competitive and regulatory constraints that continue to evolve inefficiencies or operational failures including temporary or permanent loss of customer data or insufficient internet connectivity could diminish the quality of our products services and user experience resulting in contractual liability claims by customers and other third parties regulatory actions damage to our reputation and loss of current and potential users subscribers and advertisers each of which may harm our operating results and financial condition

government litigation and regulatory activity relating to competition rules may limit how we design and market our products as a leading global software and device maker government agencies closely scruti nize us under us and foreign competition laws an increasing number of governments are regulating competition law activities and this includes increased scrutiny in potentially large markets such as the european union “eu” the us and china some ju risdictions also allow competitors or consumers to assert claims of anticompetitive conduct us federal and state antitrust authorities have previously brought enforcement actions and continue to scrutinize our business 

the european commission “the commission” closely scrutinizes the design of highvolume microsoft products and the terms on which we make certain technologies used in these products such as file formats programming interfaces and protocols available to other companies flagship product releases such as windows 10 can receive significant scrutiny under competition laws for example in 2004 the commission ordered us to create new versions of our windows operating system that do not include certain multimedia technologies and to provide our competitors with specifications for how to implement certain proprietary windows communications protocols in their own products in 2009 the commission accepted a set of commitments offered by microsoft to address the commission’s concerns relating to competition in web browsing software including an undertaking to address commission concerns relating to interoperability the web browsing commitments expired in 2014 the remaining obligations may limit our ability to innovate in windows or other products in the future diminish the developer appeal of the windows platform and increase our product development costs the availability of licenses related to protocols and file formats may enable competitors to develop software products that better mimic the functionality of our products which could hamper sales of our products 

our portfolio of firstparty devices continues to grow at the same time our oem partners offer a large variety of devices on our platforms as a result increasingly we both cooperate and compete with our oem partners creating a risk that we fail to do so in compliance with competition rules regulatory scrutiny in this area may increase certain foreign governments particularly in china and other countries in asia have advanced arguments under their competition laws that exert downward pressure on royalties for our intellectual property because these jurisdictions only recently implemented competition laws their enforcement activities are unpredictable 

government regulatory actions and court decisions such as these may hinder our ability to provide the benefits of our software to consumers and businesses reducing the attractiveness of our products and the revenue that come from them new competition law actions could be initiated the outcome of such actions or steps taken to avoid them could adversely affect us in a variety of ways including 











our global operations subject us to potential liability under anticorruption trade protection and other laws and regulations the foreign corrupt practices act and other anticorruption laws and regulations “anticorruption laws” prohibit corrupt payments by our employees vendors or agents from time to time we receive inquiries from authorities in the us and elsewhere and reports from employees and others about our business activities outside the us and our compliance with anticorruption laws specifically we have been cooperating with authorities in the us in connection with reports concerning our compliance with the foreign corrupt practices act in various countries while we devote substantial resources to our global compliance programs and have implemented policies training and internal controls designed to reduce the risk of corrupt payments our employees vendors or agents may violate our policies our failure to comply with anticorruption laws could result in significant fines and penalties criminal sanctions against us our officers or our employees prohibitions on the conduct of our business and damage to our reputation operations outside the us may be affected by changes in trade protection laws policies and measures sanctions and other regulatory requirements affecting trade and investment we may be subject to legal liability and reputational damage if we sell goods or services in violation of us trade sanctions on countries such as iran north korea cuba sudan and syria

other regulatory areas that may apply to our products and online services offerings include user privacy te lecommunications data storage and protection and online content for example regulators may take the position that our offerings such as skype are covered by laws regulating telecommunications services data protection authorities may assert that our co llection use and management of customer data is inconsistent with their laws and regulations applying these laws and regulations to our business is often unclear subject to change over time and sometimes may conflict from jurisdiction to jurisdiction additionally these laws and governments’ approach to their enforcement and our products and services are continuing to evolve compliance with these types of regulation may involve significant costs or require changes in products or business practices that result in reduced revenue noncompliance could result in the imposition of penalties or orders we stop the alleged noncompliant activity 

laws and regulations relating to the handling of personal data may impede the adoption of our services or result in increased costs legal claims or fines against us the growth of our internet and cloudbased services internationally relies increasingly on the movement of data across national boundaries legal requirements relating to the collection storage handling and transfer of personal data continue to evolve for example the eu and the us formally entered into a new framework in july 2016 that provides a mechanism for companies to transfer data from eu member states to the us this new framework called the privacy shield is intended to address shortcomings identified by the european court of justice in a predecessor mechanism the privacy shield and other mechanisms are subject to review by the european courts which may lead to uncertainty about the legal basis for data transfers across the atlantic in 2016 the eu adopted a new law governing data practices and privacy called the general data protection regulation “gdpr” which becomes effective in may 2018 the law requires firms to meet new requirements regarding the handling of personal data engineering efforts to build new capabilities to facilitate compliance with the law may entail substantial expense and the diversion of engineering resources from other projects if we are unable to engineer products that meet microsoft’s legal duties or help our customers meet their obligations under the gdpr or other data regulations we might experience reduced demand for our offerings noncompliance with the gdpr may result in monetary penalties of up to 4 of worldwide revenue 

ongoing legal reviews by regulators may result in burdensome or inconsistent requirements affecting the location and movement of our customer and internal employee data as well as the management of that data compliance may require changes in services business practices or internal systems that result in increased costs lower revenue reduced efficiency or greater difficulty in competing with foreignbased firms failure to comply with existing or new rules may result in significant penalties or orders to stop the alleged noncompliant activity 

our business depends on our ability to attract and retain talented employees our business is based on successfully attracting and retaining talented employees the market for highly skilled workers and leaders in our industry is extremely competitive we are limited in our ability to recruit internationally by restrictive domestic immigration laws changes to us immigration policies that restrain the flow of technical and professional talent may inhibit our ability to adequately staff our research and development efforts if we are less successful in our recruiting efforts or if we cannot retain key employees our ability to develop and deliver successful products and services may be adversely affected effective succession planning is also important to our longterm success failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution how employmentrelated laws are interpreted and applied to our workforce practices may result in increased operating costs and less flexibility in how we meet our workforce needs 

we have claims and lawsuits against us that may result in adverse outcomes we are subject to a variety of claims and lawsuits these claims may arise from a wide variety of business practices and initiatives including major new product releases such as windows 10 significant business transactions warranty or product claims and employment practices adverse outcomes in some or all of these claims may result in significant monetary damages or injunctive relief that could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business the litigation and other claims are subject to inherent uncertainties and management’s view of these matters may change in the future a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements could occur for the period in which the effect of an unfavorable outcome becomes probable and reasonably estimable 

we may have additional tax liabilities we are subject to income taxes in the us and many foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes in the ordinary course of our business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain we regularly are under audit by tax authorities in different jurisdictions economic and political pressures to increase tax revenue in various jurisdictions may make resolving tax disputes favorably more difficult although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation in the jurisdictions where we are subject to taxation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals the results of an audit or litigation could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements in the period or periods in which that determination is made

we earn a significant amount of our operat ing income from outside the us and any repatriation of funds currently held in foreign jurisdictions to the us may result in higher effective tax rates for the company in addition there have been proposals from congress to change us tax laws that would significantly impact how us multinational corporations are taxed on foreign earnings although we cannot predict whether or in what form any proposed legislation may pass if enacted it could have a material adverse impact on our tax expense and c ash flows 

our hardware and software products may experience quality or supply problems our verticallyintegrated hardware products such as xbox consoles surface devices and other devices we design manufacture and market are highly complex and can have defects in design manufacture or associated software we could incur significant expenses lost revenue and reputational harm as a result of recalls safety alerts or product liability claims if we fail to prevent detect or address such issues through design testing or warranty repairs we acquire some device components from sole suppliers our competitors use some of the same suppliers and their demand for hardware components can affect the capacity available to us if a component from a solesource supplier is delayed or becomes unavailable whether because of supplier capacity constraint or industry shortages we may not obtain timely replacement supplies resulting in reduced sales component shortages excess or obsolete inventory or price reductions resulting in inventory adjustments may increase our cost of revenue xbox consoles surface devices and other hardware are assembled in asia and other geographies that may be subject to disruptions in the supply chain resulting in shortages that would affect our revenue and operating margins these same risks would apply to any other verticallyintegrated hardware and software products we may offer 

our software products also may experience quality or reliability problems the highlysophisticated software products we develop may contain bugs and other defects that interfere with their intended operation any defects we do not detect and fix in prerelease testing could cause reduced sales and revenue damage to our reputation repair or remediation costs delays in the release of new products or versions or legal liability although our license agreements typically contain provisions that eliminate or limit our exposure to liability there is no assurance these provisions will withstand legal challenge 

we strive to empower all people and organizations to achieve more and accessibility of our products is an important aspect of this goal there is increasing pressure from advocacy groups regulators competitors and customers to make technology more accessible if our products do not meet customer expectations or emerging global accessibility requirements we could lose sales opportunities or face regulatory actions 

our global business exposes us to operational and economic risks our customers are located in over 200 countries and a significant part of our revenue comes from international sales the global nature of our business creates operational and economic risks emerging markets are a significant focus of our international growth strategy the developing nature of these markets presents several risks including deterioration of social political labor or economic conditions in a country or region and difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations although we hedge a portion of our international currency exposure significant fluctuations in foreign exchange rates between the us dollar and foreign currencies may adversely affect our revenue competitive or regulatory pressure to make our pricing structure uniform might require that we reduce the sales price of our software in the us and other countries 

catastrophic events or geopolitical conditions may disrupt our business a disruption or failure of our systems or operations because of a major earthquake weather event cyberattack terrorist attack or other catastrophic event could cause delays in completing sales providing services or performing other critical functions our corporate headquarters a significant portion of our research and development activities and certain other essential business operations are in the seattle washington area and we have other business operations in the silicon valley area of california both of which are seismically active regions a catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our critical business or it systems could harm our ability to conduct normal business operations providing our customers with more services and solutions in the cloud puts a premium on the resilience of our systems and strength of our business continuity management plans and magnifies the potential impact of prolonged service outages on our operating results

abrupt political change terrorist activity and armed conflict pose a risk of general economic disruption in affect ed countries which may increase our operating costs these conditions also may add uncertainty to the timing and budget for technology investment decisions by our customers and may cause supply chain disruptions for hardware manufacturers geopolitical c hange may result in changing regulatory requirements that could impact our operating strategies access to global markets hiring and profitability geopolitical instability may lead to sanctions and impact our ability to do business in some markets or wi th some publicsector customers emerging nationalist trends in specific countries may significantly alter the trade environment changes to trade policy or agreements may result in higher tariffs local sourcing initiatives or other developments that mak e it more difficult to sell our products in foreign countries any of these changes may negatively impact our revenues 

the longterm effects of climate change on the global economy or the it industry in particular are unclear environmental regulations or changes in the supply demand or available sources of energy or other natural resources may affect the availability or cost of goods and services including natural resources necessary to run our business changes in weather where we operate may increase the costs of powering and cooling computer hardware we use to develop software and provide cloudbased services 

adverse economic or market conditions may harm our business worsening economic conditions including inflation recession or other changes in economic conditions may cause lower it spending and adversely affect our revenue if demand for pcs servers and other computing devices declines or consumer or business spending for those products declines our revenue will be adversely affected substantial revenue comes from our us government contracts an extended federal government shutdown resulting from failing to pass budget appropriations adopt continuing funding resolutions or raise the debt ceiling and other budgetary decisions limiting or delaying federal government spending could reduce government it spending on our products and services and adversely affect our revenue 

our product distribution system relies on an extensive partner and retail network oems building devices that run our software have also been a significant means of distribution the impact of economic conditions on our partners such as the bankruptcy of a major distributor oem or retailer could cause sales channel disruption 

challenging economic conditions also may impair the ability of our customers to pay for products and services they have purchased as a result allowances for doubtful accounts and writeoffs of accounts receivable may increase 

we maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings types and maturities these investments are subject to general credit liquidity market and interest rate risks which may be exacerbated by unusual events that affect global financial markets a significant part of our investment portfolio comprises us government securities if global credit and equity markets decline for long periods or if there is a downgrade of the us government credit rating due to an actual or threatened default on government debt our investment portfolio may be adversely affected and we could determine that more of our investments have experienced an otherthantemporary decline in fair value requiring impairment charges that could adversely affect our financial results 

changes in our sales organization may impact revenues in july 2017 we announced plans to reorganize our global sales organization to help enable customers’ digital transformation add greater technical ability to our sales force and create pooled resources that can be used across countries and industries the reorganization is the most significant change in our global sales organization in microsoft’s history involving employees changing roles adding additional talent realigning teams and onboarding new partners successfully executing these changes will be a significant factor in enabling future revenue growth as we navigate through this transition sales profitability and cash flow could be adversely impacted

item 7

 

taxes between the u s and foreign countries the fiscal year 2016 effective tax rate included the impact of nondeductible phone charges and valuation allowances our effective tax rate was lower than the us federal statutory rate primarily due to earnings taxed at lower ra tes in foreign jurisdictions resulting from producing and distributing our products and services through our foreign regional operations centers in ireland singapore and puerto rico additionally our effective tax rate in fiscal year 2017 reflects the r ealization of tax benefits attributable to previous phone business losses 

the mix of income before income taxes between the us and foreign countries impacted our effective tax rate as a result of the geographic distribution of and customer demand for our products and services we supply our windows pc operating system to customers through our us regional operating center while we supply the microsoft office system and our server products and tools to customers through our foreign regional operations centers in fiscal year 2017 our us income before income taxes was 453 million and our foreign income before income taxes was 227 billion net revenue deferrals related to sales of windows 10 negatively impacted our fiscal year 2017 us income before income taxes by 64 billion and foreign income before income taxes by 317 million in fiscal year 2016 our us loss before income taxes was 325 million and our foreign income before income taxes was 201 billion net revenue deferrals related to sales of windows 10 negatively impacted our fiscal year 2016 us loss by 60 billion and foreign income before income taxes by 588 million

we are subject to income tax in many jurisdictions outside the us our operations in certain jurisdictions remain subject to examination for tax years 1996 to 2017 some of which are currently under audit by local tax authorities the resolutions of these audits are not expected to be material to our consolidated financial statements 

fiscal year 2016 compared with fiscal year 2015 

our effective tax rate for fiscal years 2016 and 2015 was 15 and 34 respectively our effective tax rate was lower than the us federal statutory rate primarily due to earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting from producing and distributing our products and services through our foreign regional operations centers in ireland singapore and puerto rico

valuation 

in general and where applicable we use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities to determine the fair value of our financial instruments this pricing methodology applies to our level 1 investments such as us government securities domestic and international equities and exchangetraded mutual funds if quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities are not available to determine fair value then we use quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities or inputs other than the quoted prices that are observable either directly or indirectly this pricing methodology applies to our level 2 investments such as foreign government bonds corporate notes and bonds mortgage and assetbacked securities us government and agency securities common and preferred stock and certificates of deposit level 3 investments are valued using internally developed models with unobservable inputs assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis using unobservable inputs are an immaterial portion of our portfolio 

a majority of our investments are priced by pricing vendors and are generally level 1 or level 2 investments as these vendors either provide a quoted market price in an active market or use observable inputs for their pricing without applying significant adjustments broker pricing is used mainly when a quoted price is not available the investment is not priced by our pricing vendors or when a broker price is more reflective of fair values in the market in which the investment trades our brokerpriced investments are generally classified as level 2 investments because the broker prices these investments based on similar assets without applying significant adjustments in addition all our brokerpriced investments have a sufficient level of trading volume to demonstrate that the fair values used are appropriate for these investments our fair value processes include controls that are designed to ensure appropriate fair values are recorded these controls include model validation review of key model inputs analysis of periodoverperiod fluctuations and independent recalculation of prices where appropriate

other planned uses of capital 

we will continue to invest in sales marketing product support infrastructure and existing and advanced areas of technology as well as continue making acquisitions that align with our business strategy additions to property and equipment will continue including new facilities datacenters and computer systems for research and development sales and marketing support and administrative staff we expect capital expenditures to increase in coming years to support growth in our cloud offerings we have operating leases for most us and international sales and support offices and certain equipment we have not engaged in any related party transactions or arrangements with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect liquidity or the availability of capital resources 

liquidity 

we earn a significant amount of our operating income outside the us which is deemed to be permanently reinvested in foreign jurisdictions as a result as discussed above under cash cash equivalents and investments the majority of our cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments are held by foreign subsidiaries we currently do not intend nor foresee a need to repatriate these funds we expect existing domestic cash cash equivalents shortterm investments cash flows from operations and access to capital markets to continue to be sufficient to fund our domestic operating activities and cash commitments for investing and financing activities such as regular quarterly dividends debt maturities and material capital expenditures for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future in addition we expect existing foreign cash cash equivalents shortterm investments and cash flows from operations to continue to be sufficient to fund our foreign operating activities and cash commitments for investing activities such as material capital expenditures for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future 

should we require more capital in the us than is generated by our operations domestically for example to fund significant discretionary activities such as business acquisitions and share repurchases we could elect to repatriate future earnings from foreign jurisdictions or raise capital in the us through debt or equity issuances these alternatives could result in higher effective tax rates increased interest expense or dilution of our earnings we have borrowed funds domestically and continue to believe we have the ability to do so at reasonable interest rates

revenue recognition 

revenue recognition for multipleelement arrangements requires judgment to determine if multiple elements exist whether elements can be accounted for as separate units of accounting and if so the fair value for each of the elements 

judgment is also required to assess whether future releases of certain software represent new products or upgrades and enhancements to existing products certain volume licensing arrangements include a perpetual license for current products combined with rights to receive unspecified future versions of software products and are accounted for as subscriptions with billings recorded as unearned revenue and recognized as revenue ratably over the coverage period

microsoft enters into arrangements that can include various combinations of software services and hardware where elements are delivered over different periods of time and when allowed under us gaap revenue is allocated to the respective elements based on their relative selling prices at the inception of the arrangement and revenue is recognized as each element is delivered we use a hierarchy to determine the fair value to be used for allocating revenue to elements i vendorspecific objective evidence of fair value “vsoe” ii thirdparty evidence and iii best estimate of selling price “esp” for software elements we follow the industryspecific software guidance which only allows for the use of vsoe in establishing fair value generally vsoe is the price charged when the deliverable is sold separately or the price established by management for a product that is not yet sold if it is probable that the price will not change before introduction into the marketplace esps are established as best estimates of what the selling prices would be if the deliverables were sold regularly on a standalone basis our process for determining esps requires judgment and considers multiple factors that may vary over time depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each deliverable 

customers purchasing a windows 10 license will receive unspecified updates and upgrades over the life of their windows 10 device at no additional cost as these updates and upgrades will not be sold on a standalone basis we are unable to establish vsoe accordingly revenue from licenses of windows 10 is recognized ratably over the estimated life of the related device which ranges between two to four years 

the new standard related to revenue recognition will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements see note 1 – accounting policies in the notes to financial statements part ii item 8 of this form 10k for further discussion 

impairment of investment securities 

we review investments quarterly for indicators of otherthantemporary impairment this determination requires significant judgment in making this judgment we employ a systematic methodology quarterly that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments if the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value we evaluate among other factors general market conditions credit quality of debt instrument issuers the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost and for equity securities our intent and ability to hold or plans to sell the investment for fixedincome securities we also evaluate whether we have plans to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery we also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the investee including industry and sector performance changes in technology and operational and financing cash flow factors once a decline in fair value is determined to be otherthantemporary an impairment charge is recorded to other income expense net and a new cost basis in the investment is established if market industry andor investee conditions deteriorate we may incur future impairments 

goodwill 

we allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the business combination we evaluate our reporting units on an annual basis and if necessary reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level operating segment or one level below an operating segment on an annual basis may 1 for us and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value these events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate legal factors operating performance indicators competition or sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit 

application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment including the identification of reporting units assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units assignment of goodwill to reporting units and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit the fair value of each reporting unit is estimated primarily through the use of a discounted cash flow methodology this analysis requires significant judgments including estimation of future cash flows which is dependent on internal forecasts estimation of the longterm rate of growth for our business estimation of the useful life over which cash flows will occur and determination of our weighted average cost of capital 

part ii 

item 7

 

the estimates used to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit change from year to year based on operating results market conditions and other factors changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and goodwill impairment for each reporting unit 

research and development costs 

costs incurred internally in researching and developing a computer software product are charged to expense until technological feasibility has been established for the product once technological feasibility is established all software costs are capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers judgment is required in determining when technological feasibility of a product is established we have determined that technological feasibility for our software products is reached after all highrisk development issues have been resolved through coding and testing generally this occurs shortly before the products are released to production the amortization of these costs is included in cost of revenue over the estimated life of the products 

legal and other contingencies 

the outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought against us are subject to significant uncertainty an estimated loss from a loss contingency such as a legal proceeding or claim is accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated in determining whether a loss should be accrued we evaluate among other factors the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss changes in these factors could materially impact our consolidated financial statements

income taxes 

the objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity’s financial statements or tax returns we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement accounting literature also provides guidance on derecognition of income tax assets and liabilities classification of deferred income tax assets and liabilities accounting for interest and penalties associated with tax positions and income tax disclosures judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized on our consolidated financial statements or tax returns variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our consolidated financial statements 

inventories 

inventories are stated at average cost subject to the lower of cost or market cost includes materials labor and manufacturing overhead related to the purchase and production of inventories we regularly review inventory quantities on hand future purchase commitments with our suppliers and the estimated utility of our inventory these reviews include analysis of demand forecasts product life cycle status product development plans current sales levels pricing strategy and component cost trends if our review indicates a reduction in utility below carrying value we reduce our inventory to a new cost basis through a charge to cost of revenue

risks 

we are exposed to economic risk from foreign exchange rates interest rates credit risk equity prices and commodity prices a portion of these risks is hedged but they may impact our consolidated financial statements 

foreign currency 

certain forecasted transactions assets and liabilities are exposed to foreign currency risk we monitor our foreign currency exposures daily and use hedges where practicable to offset the risks and maximize the economic effectiveness of our foreign currency positions principal currencies hedged include the euro japanese yen british pound canadian dollar and australian dollar 

interest rate 

our fixedincome portfolio is diversified across credit sectors and maturities consisting primarily of investmentgrade securities the credit risk and average maturity of the fixedincome portfolio is managed to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain global and domestic fixedincome indices in addition we use “to be announced” forward purchase commitments of mortgagebacked assets to gain exposure to agency mortgagebacked securities 

equity 

our equity portfolio consists of global developed and emerging market securities that are subject to market price risk we manage the securities relative to certain global and domestic indices and expect their economic risk and return to correlate with these indices 

commodity 

we use broadbased commodity exposures to enhance portfolio returns and facilitate portfolio diversification our investment portfolio has exposure to a variety of commodities including precious metals energy and grain we manage these exposures relative to global commodity indices and expect their economic risk and return to correlate with these indices 

valueatrisk 

we use a valueatrisk “var” model to estimate and quantify our market risks var is the expected loss for a given confidence level in the fair value of our portfolio due to adverse market movements over a defined time horizon the var model is not intended to represent actual losses in fair value including determinations of otherthantemporary losses in fair value in accordance with us gaap but is used as a risk estimation and management tool the distribution of the potential changes in total market value of all holdings is computed based on the historical volatilities and correlations among foreign exchange rates interest rates equity prices and commodity prices assuming normal market conditions 

the var is calculated as the total loss that will not be exceeded at the 975 percentile confidence level or alternatively stated the losses could exceed the var in 25 out of 1000 cases several risk factors are not captured in the model including liquidity risk operational risk and legal risk

item 7a

 

the following table sets forth the oneday var for substantially all of our positions as of june 30 2017 and 2016 and for the year ended june 30 2017 

 



total oneday var for the combined risk categories was 207 million and 225 million as of june 30 2017 and 2016 the total var is 35 and 29 less as of june 30 2017 and 2016 respectively than the sum of the separate risk categories in the table above due to the diversification benefit of the combination of risks

 reinvent productivity and business processes 

we believe we can significantly enhance the lives of our customers using our broad portfolio of productivity communication and information services that span devices and platforms productivity will be the first and foremost objective to enable people to meet and collaborate more easily and to effectively express ideas in new ways we invent new scenarios that in turn create opportunity for our partners and help businesses accelerate their transformation while respecting each person’s privacy choices the foundation for these efforts will rest on advancing our leading productivity collaboration communication and business process tools including word excel powerpoint outlook onenote onedrive skype and microsoft dynamics “dynamics” with office 365 we provide these familiar industryleading productivity and business process tools as cloud services enabling access from anywhere and any device this creates an opportunity to reach new customers and expand the usage of our services by our existing customers we see opportunity in combining our offerings in new ways that are mobile collaborative intelligent and trustworthy we offer our services across platforms and devices outside our own as people move from device to device so will their content and the richness of their services we engineer our applications so users can find try and buy them in frictionfree ways 

build the intelligent cloud platform 

in deploying technology that advances business strategy enterprises decide what solutions will make employees more productive collaborative and satisfied and connect with customers in new and compelling ways they work to unlock business insights from a world of data to achieve these objectives increasingly businesses look to leverage the benefits of the cloud helping businesses move to the cloud is one of our largest opportunities and we believe we work from a position of strength microsoft is one of two leaders in the market 

the shift to the cloud is driven by three important economies of scale larger datacenters can deploy computational resources at significantly lower cost per unit than smaller ones larger datacenters can coordinate and aggregate diverse customer geographic and application demand patterns improving the utilization of computing storage and network resources and multitenancy lowers application maintenance labor costs for large public clouds as one of the largest providers of cloud computing at scale we are wellpositioned to help businesses move to the cloud and focus on innovation while leaving nondifferentiating activities to reliable and costeffective providers like microsoft 

we believe our server products and cloud services which include microsoft sql server “sql server” windows server visual studio system center and microsoft azure “azure” make us the only company with a public private and hybrid cloud platform that can power modern business with azure we are one of very few cloud vendors that run at a scale that meets the needs of businesses of all sizes and complexities we are working to enhance the return on it investment by enabling enterprises to combine their existing datacenters and our public cloud into a single cohesive infrastructure businesses can deploy applications in their own datacenter a partner’s datacenter or in our datacenters with common security management and administration across all environments with the flexibility and scale they want 

we enable organizations to securely adopt softwareasaservice applications both our own and thirdparty and integrate them with their existing security and management infrastructure we continue to innovate with higherlevel services including identity and directory services that manage employee corporate identity and manage and secure corporate information accessed and stored across a growing number of devices rich data storage and analytics services machine learning services media services web and mobile backend services and developer productivity services to foster a rich developer ecosystem our platform is extensible enabling customers and partners to further customize and enhance our solutions achieving even more value this strategy requires continuing investment in datacenters and other infrastructure to support our services

 windows 

the windows operating system is designed to deliver a more personal computing experience for users by enabling consistency of experience applications and information across their devices we consider the launch of windows 10 in july 2015 to be a transformative moment as we moved from an operating system that runs on a pc to a service that can power the full spectrum of devices 

windows revenue is impacted significantly by the number of windows operating system licenses purchased by oems which they preinstall on the devices they sell in addition to computing device market volume windows revenue is impacted by 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 volume licensing of the windows operating system is affected mainly by the demand from commercial customers for volume licensing and software assurance often reflecting the number of information workers in a licensed enterprise and is therefore relatively independent of the number of pcs sold in a given year 

patent licensing includes our programs to license patents across a broad array of technology areas including mobile devices and cloud offerings

competition 

the windows operating system faces competition from various software products and from alternative platforms and devices mainly from apple and google we believe windows competes effectively by giving customers choice value flexibility security an easytouse interface and compatibility with a broad range of hardware and software applications including those that enable productivity 

our devices face competition from various computer tablet hardware and phone manufacturers and offer a unique combination of highquality industrial design and innovative technologies across various price points many of which are also current or potential partners and customers these manufacturers include apple as well as our windows oem partners 

our gaming platform competes with console platforms from sony and nintendo both of which have a large established base of customers the lifecycle for gaming and entertainment consoles averages five to ten years nintendo released their latest generation console in november 2012 sony released their latest generation console in november 2013 

in addition to sony and nintendo we compete with other providers of entertainment services through online marketplaces we believe our gaming platform is effectively positioned against competitive products and services based on significant innovation in hardware architecture user interface developer tools online gaming and entertainment services and continued strong exclusive content from our own game franchises as well as other digital content offerings our video games competitors include electronic arts and activision blizzard xbox live faces competition from various online marketplaces including those operated by amazon apple and google

to serve the needs of customers around the world and to improve the quality and usability of products in international markets we localize many of our products to reflect local languages and conventions localizing a product may require modifying the user interface altering dialog boxes and translating text 

we operate manufacturing facilities for the production and customization of phones predominantly in vietnam we announced the sale of our entrylevel feature phone business in may 2016 which includes the sale of our phone manufacturing facility in vietnam 

our devices other than phones are primarily manufactured by thirdparty contract manufacturers we generally have the ability to use other manufacturers if a current vendor becomes unavailable or unable to meet our requirements 

research and development 

during fiscal years 2016 2015 and 2014 research and development expense was 120 billion 120 billion and 114 billion respectively these amounts represented 14 13 and 13 of revenue in fiscal years 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively we plan to continue to make significant investments in a broad range of research and development efforts 

product and service development and intellectual property 

we develop most of our products and services internally through three engineering groups 

 

  

  

 internal development allows us to maintain competitive advantages that come from product differentiation and closer technical control over our products and services it also gives us the freedom to decide which modifications and enhancements are most important and when they should be implemented we strive to obtain information as early as possible about changing usage patterns and hardware advances that may affect software design before releasing new software platforms we provide application vendors with a range of resources and guidelines for development training and testing generally we also create product documentation internally 

we protect our intellectual property investments in a variety of ways we work actively in the us and internationally to ensure the enforcement of copyright trademark trade secret and other protections that apply to our software and hardware products services business plans and branding we are a leader among technology companies in pursuing patents and currently have a portfolio of over 61000 us and international patents issued and over 35000

pending while we employ much of our internally developed intellectual property exclusively in microsoft products and services we also engage in outbound and inbound licensing of specific patented technologies that are incorporated into licensees’ or microsoft’s products from time to time we enter into broader crosslicense agreements with other technology companies covering entire groups of patents we also purchase or license technology that we incorporate into our products or services at times we make select intellectual property broadly available at no or low cost to achieve a strategic objective such as promoting industry standards advancing interoperability or attracting and enabling our external development community 

while it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of our products and business methods we believe based upon past experience and industry practice such licenses generally could be obtained on commercially reasonable terms we believe our continuing research and product development are not materially dependent on any single license or other agreement with a third party relating to the development of our products 

investing in the future 

microsoft’s success is based on our ability to create new and compelling products services and experiences for our users to initiate and embrace disruptive technology trends to enter new geographic and product markets and to drive broad adoption of our products and services we invest in a range of emerging technology trends and breakthroughs that we believe offer significant opportunities to deliver value to our customers and growth for the company based on our assessment of key technology trends we maintain our longterm commitment to research and development across a wide spectrum of technologies tools and platforms spanning digital work and life experiences cloud computing and devices operating systems and hardware 

while our main research and development facilities are located in redmond washington we also operate research and development facilities in other parts of the us and around the world including canada china denmark finland france india ireland israel japan and the united kingdom this global approach helps us remain competitive in local markets and enables us to continue to attract top talent from across the world we generally fund research at the corporate level to ensure that we are looking beyond immediate product considerations to opportunities further in the future we also fund research and development activities at the business segment level much of our business segment level research and development is coordinated with other segments and leveraged across the company 

in addition to our main research and development operations we also operate microsoft research microsoft research is one of the world’s largest computer science research organizations and works in close collaboration with top universities around the world to advance the stateoftheart in computer science providing us a unique perspective on future technology trends and contributing to our innovation 

distribution sales and marketing 

we market and distribute our products and services through the following channels oems distributors and resellers online and microsoft retail stores our sales force performs a variety of functions including working directly with enterprises and public sector organizations worldwide to identify and meet their software requirements managing oem relationships and supporting solution integrators independent software vendors and other partners who engage directly with our customers to perform sales consulting and fulfillment functions for our products 

oems 

we distribute software through oems that preinstall our software on new devices and servers they sell the largest component of the oem business is the windows operating system preinstalled on computing devices oems also sell hardware preinstalled with other microsoft products including server and embedded operating systems and applications such as our microsoft office suite in addition to these products we also market our services through oems and service bundles such as windows with bing or windows with office 365 subscription

item 1 

  

there are two broad categories of oems the largest oems many of which operate globally are referred to as “direct oems” as our relationship with them is managed through a direct agreement between microsoft and the oem we have distribution agreements covering one or more of our products with virtually all of the multinational oems including acer asust dell fujitsu hewlettpackard lenovo samsung toshiba and with many regional and local oems the second broad category of oems consists of lowervolume pc manufacturers also called “system builders” which source their microsoft software for preinstallation and local redistribution primarily through the microsoft distributor channel rather than through a direct agreement or relationship with microsoft 

distributors and resellers 

many organizations that license our products and services through enterprise agreements transact directly with us with sales support from solution integrators independent software vendors web agencies and developers that advise organizations on licensing our products and services “enterprise agreement software advisors” or “esas” organizations also license our products and services indirectly primarily through licensing solution partners “lsps” distributors valueadded resellers “vars” oems system builder channels and retailers although each type of reselling partner reaches organizations of all sizes lsps are primarily engaged with large organizations distributors resell primarily to vars and vars typically reach small and mediumsized organizations esas typically are also authorized as lsps and operate as resellers for our other licensing programs such as the select plus and open licensing programs discussed under “licensing options” below some of our distributors include ingram micro and tech data and some of our largest resellers include cdw dell insight enterprises and software house international 

our dynamics software offerings are also licensed to enterprises through a global network of channel partners providing vertical solutions and specialized services we distribute our retail packaged products primarily through independent nonexclusive distributors authorized replicators resellers and retail outlets individual consumers obtain these products primarily through retail outlets including microsoft retail stores we distribute our devices through thirdparty retailers and microsoft retail stores our phones are also distributed through global wireless communications carriers we have a network of field sales representatives and field support personnel that solicit orders from distributors and resellers and provide product training and sales support 

online 

although onpremises software continues to be an important part of our business increasingly we are delivering additional value to customers through cloudbased services we provide commercial cloudbased solutions such as office 365 azure and dynamics crm online we also provide online content services to consumers through bing msn portals and channels office 365 xbox live outlookcom onedrive skype and windows store other services delivered online include our online advertising platform with offerings for advertisers and publishers as well as microsoft developer network subscription content and updates periodic product updates and online technical and practice readiness resources to support our partners in developing and selling our products and solutions as we increasingly deliver online services we sell many of these cloudbased services through our enterprise agreements and have also enabled new sales programs to reach small and mediumsized businesses these programs include direct sales direct sales supported by a large network of partner advisors and resale of services through operator channels such as telephone cell and cable providers 

we also sell our products through our microsoft retail stores and online marketplaces 

licensing options 

we license software to organizations under agreements that allow the customer to acquire multiple licenses of products and services our agreements for organizations to acquire multiple licenses of products and services are designed to provide them with a means of doing so without having to acquire separate licenses through retail channels in delivering organizational licensing agreements to the market we use different programs designed to provide flexibility for organizations of various sizes while these programs may differ in various parts of the world generally they include those discussed below

open licensing 

designed primarily for small and mediumsized organizations the open programs allow customers to acquire perpetual or subscription licenses and at the customer’s election rights to future versions of software products over a specified time period generally two or three years depending on the specific programs used the open programs have several variations to fit customers’ diverse ways of purchasing under the open license program customers can acquire licenses only or licenses with software assurance andor renew software assurance upon the expiration of other existing volume licensing agreements under the open value and open value subscription programs customers can acquire perpetual or subscription licenses respectively over a threeyear period online services are available in each of the open programs

 item 1a risk factors 

our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties including those described below that could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations cash flows and the trading price of our common stock 

we face intense competition across all markets for our products and services which may lead to lower revenue or operating margins 

competition in the technology sector 

our competitors range in size from diversified global companies with significant research and development resources to small specialized firms whose narrower product lines may let them be more effective in deploying technical marketing and financial resources barriers to entry in many of our businesses are low and many of the areas in which we compete evolve rapidly with changing and disruptive technologies shifting user needs and frequent introductions of new products and services our ability to remain competitive depends on our success in making innovative products devices and services that appeal to businesses and consumers 

competition among platforms ecosystems and devices 

an important element of our business model has been to create platformbased ecosystems on which many participants can build diverse solutions a wellestablished ecosystem creates beneficial network effects among users application developers and the platform provider that can accelerate growth establishing significant scale in the marketplace is necessary to achieve and maintain attractive margins we face significant competition from firms that provide competing platforms applications and services 

 

  

   

  

part i 

item 1a 

  

  

 business model competition 

companies compete with us based on a growing variety of business models 

 

  

  

 the competitive pressures described above may cause decreased sales volumes price reductions andor increased operating costs such as for research and development marketing and sales incentives this may lead to lower revenue gross margins and operating income 

our increasing focus on services presents execution and competitive risks a growing part of our business involves cloudbased services available across the spectrum of computing devices our strategic vision is to compete and grow as a productivity and platform company for the mobilefirst and cloudfirst world at the same time our competitors are rapidly developing and deploying cloudbased services for consumers and business customers pricing and delivery models are evolving devices and form factors influence how users access services in the cloud and sometimes the user’s choice of which suite of cloudbased services to use we are devoting significant resources to develop and deploy our cloudbased strategies the windows ecosystem must continue to evolve with this changing environment we are undertaking cultural and organizational changes to drive accountability and eliminate obstacles to innovation the company’s increasing reliance on datadriven insights is becoming more important to the success of key opportunities in monetization customer perceptions of quality and operational efficiency besides software development costs we are incurring costs to build and maintain infrastructure to support cloud computing services these costs will reduce the operating margins we have previously achieved whether we succeed in cloudbased services depends on our execution in several areas including 

 

  

  

   

  

part i 

item 1a 

  

  

 it is uncertain whether our strategies will attract the users or generate the revenue required to succeed if we are not effective in executing organizational and technical changes to increase efficiency and accelerate innovation or if we fail to generate sufficient usage of our new products and services we may not grow revenue in line with the infrastructure and development investments described above this may negatively impact gross margins and operating income 

we make significant investments in new products and services that may not achieve expected returns we will continue to make significant investments in research development and marketing for existing products services and technologies including the windows operating system the microsoft office system bing windows phone windows server the windows store the microsoft azure services platform office 365 other cloudbased offerings and the xbox entertainment platform we also invest in the development and acquisition of a variety of hardware for productivity communication and entertainment including pcs tablets phones and gaming devices investments in new technology are speculative commercial success depends on many factors including innovativeness developer support and effective distribution and marketing if customers do not perceive our latest offerings as providing significant new functionality or other value they may reduce their purchases of new software and hardware products or upgrades unfavorably affecting revenue we may not achieve significant revenue from new product service and distribution channel investments for several years if at all new products and services may not be profitable and even if they are profitable operating margins for some new products and businesses will not be as high as the margins we have experienced historically 

the launch of windows 10 with free upgrades available to existing users of windows 7 and 81 constitutes the most ambitious update effort we have ever undertaken we have done extensive preparation and compatibility testing for applications and devices to help ensure a positive experience for our users installing windows 10 however if users have a negative upgrade experience or the community reacts negatively to the process we are following to promote and undertake the upgrades the reception of windows 10 in the marketplace may be harmed and customers or government agencies may bring litigation or regulatory actions in addition we anticipate that windows 10 will enable new postlicense monetization opportunities beyond initial license revenues our failure to realize these opportunities to the extent we expect could have an adverse impact on our revenues finally our practices around data collection use and management in windows 10 could result in regulatory review and decisions directing us to change these practices and imposing fines if so we could face negative public reaction degraded user experiences and reduced flexibility in product design 

developing new technologies is complex it can require long development and testing periods significant delays in new releases or significant problems in creating new products or services could adversely affect our revenue 

acquisitions joint ventures and strategic alliances may have an adverse effect on our business we expect to continue making acquisitions and entering into joint ventures and strategic alliances as part of our longterm business strategy in june 2016 we announced our acquisition of linkedin for approximately 262 billion the linkedin acquisition and other transactions and arrangements involve significant challenges and risks including that they do not advance our business strategy that we get an unsatisfactory return on our investment that we have difficulty integrating new employees business systems and technology or that they distract management from our other businesses if an arrangement fails to adequately anticipate changing circumstances and interests of a party it may result in early termination or renegotiation of the arrangement the success of these transactions and arrangements will depend in part on our ability to leverage them to enhance our existing products and services or develop compelling new ones it may take longer than expected to realize the full benefits from these transactions and arrangements such as increased revenue enhanced efficiencies or increased market share or the benefits may ultimately be smaller than we expected these events could adversely affect our operating results or financial condition

item 1a 

  

if our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets become impaired we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings we acquire other companies and intangible assets and may not realize all the economic benefit from those acquisitions which could cause an impairment of goodwill or intangibles we review our amortizable intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable we test goodwill for impairment at least annually factors that may be a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets may not be recoverable include a decline in our stock price and market capitalization reduced future cash flow estimates and slower growth rates in industry segments in which we participate we may be required to record a significant charge on our consolidated financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets is determined negatively affecting our results of operations for example in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015 we recorded a 51 billion charge for the impairment of goodwill and a 22 billion charge for the impairment of intangible assets and in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016 we recorded a 480 million charge for the impairment of intangible assets the impairment charges for both periods related to our phone business our acquisition of linkedin will result in a significant increase in our goodwill and intangible asset balances 

we may not earn the revenues we expect from our intellectual property rights 

we may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property rights 

protecting our global intellectual property rights and combating unlicensed copying and use of our software and other intellectual property is difficult while piracy adversely affects us revenue the impact on revenue from outside the us is more significant particularly in countries where laws are less protective of intellectual property rights our revenue in these markets may grow slower than the underlying device market similarly the absence of harmonized patent laws makes it more difficult to ensure consistent respect for patent rights throughout the world we educate consumers about the benefits of licensing genuine products and obtaining indemnification benefits for intellectual property risks and we educate lawmakers about the advantages of a business climate where intellectual property rights are protected reductions in the legal protection for software intellectual property rights could adversely affect revenue 

we may not receive expected royalties from our patent licenses 

we expend significant resources to patent the intellectual property we create with the expectation that we will generate revenues by incorporating that intellectual property in our products or services or in some instances by licensing our patents to others in return for a royalty changes in the law may weaken our ability to prevent the use of patented technology or collect revenue for licensing our patents these include legislative changes and regulatory actions that make it more difficult to obtain injunctions and the increasing use of legal process to challenge issued patents similarly licensees of our patents may fail to satisfy their obligations to pay us royalties or may contest the scope and extent of their obligations finally the royalties we can obtain to monetize our intellectual property may decline because of the evolution of technology selling price changes in products using licensed patents or the difficulty of discovering infringements 

third parties may claim we infringe their intellectual property rights from time to time others claim we infringe their intellectual property rights the number of these claims may grow because of constant technological change in the markets in which we compete the extensive patent coverage of existing technologies the rapid rate of issuance of new patents and our offering of firstparty devices such as surface and lumia phones to resolve these claims we may enter into royalty and licensing agreements on terms that are less favorable than currently available stop selling or redesign affected products or services or pay damages to satisfy indemnification commitments with our customers these outcomes may cause operating margins to decline besides money damages in some jurisdictions plaintiffs can seek injunctive relief that may limit or prevent importing marketing and selling our products or services that have infringing technologies in some countries such as germany an injunction can be issued before the parties have fully litigated the validity of the underlying patents we have paid significant amounts to settle claims related to the use of technology and intellectual property rights and to procure intellectual property rights as part of our strategy to manage this risk and may continue to do so

item 1a 

  

we may not be able to protect our source code from copying if there is an unauthorized disclosure of source code source code the detailed program commands for our operating systems and other software programs is critical to our business although we license portions of our application and operating system source code to several licensees we take significant measures to protect the secrecy of large portions of our source code if a significant portion of our source code leaks we might lose future trade secret protection for that source code it may become easier for third parties to compete with our products by copying functionality which could adversely affect our revenue and operating margins unauthorized disclosure of source code also could increase the security risks described in the next paragraph 

cyberattacks and security vulnerabilities could lead to reduced revenue increased costs liability claims or harm to our competitive position 

security of microsoft’s information technology 

threats to it security can take a variety of forms individual and groups of hackers and sophisticated organizations including statesponsored organizations or nationstates themselves may take steps that pose threats to our customers and our it these actors may use a wide variety of methods which may include developing and deploying malicious software to attack our products and services and gain access to our networks and datacenters using social engineering techniques or acting in a coordinated manner to launch distributed denial of service or other coordinated attacks cyber threats are constantly evolving thereby increasing the difficulty of detecting and successfully defending against them cyber threats can have cascading impacts that unfold with increasing speed across our internal networks and systems and those of our partners and customers breaches of our network or data security could disrupt the security of our internal systems and business applications impair our ability to provide services to our customers and protect the privacy of their data result in product development delays compromise confidential or technical business information harming our competitive position result in theft or misuse of our intellectual property or other assets require us to allocate more resources to improved technologies or otherwise adversely affect our business 

in addition our internal it environment continues to evolve often we are early adopters of new devices and technologies we embrace new ways of sharing data and communicating internally and with partners and customers using methods such as social networking and other consumeroriented technologies our business policies and internal security controls may not keep pace with these changes as new threats emerge 

security of our products services devices and customers’ data 

security threats are a particular challenge to companies like us whose business is technology products and services threats to our own it infrastructure can also affect our customers customers using our cloudbased services rely on the security of our infrastructure to ensure the reliability of our services and the protection of their data hackers tend to focus their efforts on the most popular operating systems programs and services including many of ours and we expect that to continue the security of our products and services is important in our customers’ purchasing decisions 

to defend against security threats both to our internal it systems and those of our customers we must continuously engineer more secure products and services enhance security and reliability features improve the deployment of software updates to address security vulnerabilities develop mitigation technologies that help to secure customers from attacks even when software updates are not deployed maintain the digital security infrastructure that protects the integrity of our network products and services and provide customers security tools such as firewalls and antivirus software 

the cost of these steps could reduce our operating margins if we fail to do these things well actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products and services could harm our reputation and lead customers to reduce or delay future purchases of products or subscriptions to services or to use competing products or services customers may also spend more on protecting their existing computer systems from attack which could delay adoption of additional 

  

  

part i

products or services customers may fail to update their systems continue to run software or operating systems we no longer support or may fail timely to install security patches any of these actions by customers could adversely affect our revenue actual or perceived vulnerabilities may lead to claims against us although our license agreements typically contain provisions that eliminate or limit our exposure to liability there is no assurance these provisions will withstand legal challenges legislative or regulatory action in these areas may increase the costs to develop implement or secure our products and services 

disclosure of personal data could cause liability and harm our reputation as we continue to grow the number and scale of our cloudbased offerings we store and process increasingly large amounts of personally identifiable information of our customers the continued occurrence of highprofile data breaches provides evidence of an external environment increasingly hostile to information security despite our efforts to improve the security controls across our business groups and geographies it is possible our security controls over personal data our training of employees and vendors on data security and other practices we follow may not prevent the improper disclosure of customer data we or our vendors store and manage improper disclosure could harm our reputation lead to legal exposure to customers or subject us to liability under laws that protect personal data resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue our software products and services also enable our customers to store and process personal data onpremises or increasingly in a cloudbased environment we host government authorities can sometimes require us to produce customer data in response to valid legal orders in the us and elsewhere we advocate for transparency concerning these requests and appropriate limitations on government authority to compel disclosure despite our efforts to protect customer data perceptions that the collection use and retention of personal information is not satisfactorily protected could inhibit sales of our products or services and could limit adoption of our cloudbased solutions by consumers businesses and government entities additional security measures we may take to address customer concerns or constraints on our flexibility to determine where and how to operate datacenters in response to customer expectations or governmental rules or actions may cause higher operating expenses 

we may have outages data losses and disruptions of our online services if we fail to maintain an adequate operations infrastructure our increasing user traffic growth in services and the complexity of our products and services demand more computing power we spend substantial amounts to build purchase or lease datacenters and equipment and to upgrade our technology and network infrastructure to handle more traffic on our websites and in our datacenters these demands continue to increase as we introduce new products and services and support the growth of existing services such as bing exchange online office 365 sharepoint online onedrive skype xbox live microsoft azure outlookcom windows stores and microsoft account services we are rapidly growing our business of providing a platform and backend hosting for services provided by third parties to their end users maintaining securing and expanding this infrastructure is expensive and complex it requires that we maintain an internet connectivity infrastructure that is robust and reliable within competitive and regulatory constraints that continue to evolve inefficiencies or operational failures including temporary or permanent loss of customer data or insufficient internet connectivity could diminish the quality of our products services and user experience resulting in contractual liability claims by customers and other third parties damage to our reputation and loss of current and potential users subscribers and advertisers each of which may harm our operating results and financial condition 

government litigation and regulatory activity relating to competition rules may limit how we design and market our products as a leading global software and device maker we are closely scrutinized by government agencies under us and foreign competition laws an increasing number of governments are regulating competition law activities and this includes increased scrutiny in potentially large markets such as the european union “eu” the us and china some jurisdictions also allow competitors or consumers to assert claims of anticompetitive conduct us federal and state antitrust authorities have previously brought enforcement actions and continue to scrutinize our business 

the european commission “the commission” closely scrutinizes the design of highvolume microsoft products and the terms on which we make certain technologies used in these products such as file formats programming interfaces and protocols available to other companies flagship product releases such as windows 10 can receive significant scrutiny under competition laws for example in 2004 the commission ordered us to create new versions of our windows operating system that do not include certain multimedia technologies and to provide our

competitors with specifications for how to implement certain proprietary windows communications protocols in their own products in 2009 the commission accepted a set of commitments offered by microsoft to address the commission’s concerns relating to competition in web browsing software including an undertaking to address commission concerns relating to interoperability the web browsing commitments expired in 2014 the remaining obligations may limit our ability to innovate in windows or other products in the future diminish the developer appeal of the windows platform and increase our product development costs the availability of licenses related to protocols and file formats may enable competitors to develop software products that better mimic the functionality of our products which could hamper sales of our products 

our portfolio of firstparty devices continues to grow at the same time our oem partners offer a large variety of devices on our platforms as a result increasingly we both cooperate and compete with our oem partners creating a risk that we fail to do so in compliance with competition rules regulatory scrutiny in this area may increase certain foreign governments particularly in china and other countries in asia have advanced arguments under their competition laws that exert downward pressure on royalties for our intellectual property because these jurisdictions only recently implemented competition laws their enforcement activities are unpredictable 

government regulatory actions and court decisions such as these may hinder our ability to provide the benefits of our software to consumers and businesses reducing the attractiveness of our products and the revenue that come from them new competition law actions could be initiated the outcome of such actions or steps taken to avoid them could adversely affect us in a variety of ways including 

 

  

  

  

  

 our global operations subject us to potential liability under anticorruption trade protection and other laws and regulations the foreign corrupt practices act and other anticorruption laws and regulations “anticorruption laws” prohibit corrupt payments by our employees vendors or agents from time to time we receive inquiries from authorities in the us and elsewhere and reports from employees and others about our business activities outside the us and our compliance with anticorruption laws specifically we have been cooperating with authorities in the us in connection with reports concerning our compliance with the foreign corrupt practices act in various countries while we devote substantial resources to our global compliance programs and have implemented policies training and internal controls designed to reduce the risk of corrupt payments our employees vendors or agents may violate our policies our failure to comply with anticorruption laws could result in significant fines and penalties criminal sanctions against us our officers or our employees prohibitions on the conduct of our business and damage to our reputation geopolitical instability may lead to sanctions and impact our ability to do business in some geographies operations outside the us may be affected by changes in trade protection laws policies and measures sanctions and other regulatory requirements affecting trade and investment we may be subject to legal liability and reputational damage if we sell goods or services in violation of us trade sanctions on countries such as iran north korea cuba sudan and syria 

other regulatory areas that may apply to our products and online services offerings include user privacy telecommunications data storage and protection and online content for example regulators may take the position that our offerings such as skype are covered by laws regulating telecommunications services applying these laws and regulations to our business is often unclear subject to change over time and sometimes may conflict from

jurisdiction to jurisdiction additionally these laws and governments’ approach to their enforcement and our products and services are continuing to evolve compliance with these types of regulation may involve significant costs or require changes in products or business practices that result in reduced revenue noncompliance could result in the imposition of penalties or orders we stop the alleged noncompliant activity 

laws and regulations relating to the handling of personal data may impede the adoption of our services or result in increased costs legal claims or fines against us the growth of our internet and cloudbased services internationally relies increasingly on the movement of data across national boundaries legal requirements relating to the collection storage handling and transfer of personal data continue to evolve for example in october 2015 the european court of justice “ecj” invalidated the euus safe harbor framework in place since 2000 that enabled companies to transfer data from eu member states to the us although other legallyrecognized methods to enable data transfers currently remain valid the reasoning of the ecj striking down the safe harbor framework could be used to challenge those methods in future complaints there is a recognized need for a new regulatory safe harbor framework that will also support other methods of data transfer between the eu and us outcomes may include a new transatlantic data transfer agreement a new eu data protection directive or a range of legal requirements adopted by individual eu member states or no action at all one or more of these outcomes may result in burdensome or inconsistent requirements affecting the location and movement of our customer and internal employee data as well as the management of that data compliance may require changes in services business practices or internal systems that result in increased costs lower revenue reduced efficiency or greater difficulty in competing with foreignbased firms failure to comply with existing or new rules may result in significant penalties or orders to stop the alleged noncompliant activity 

our business depends on our ability to attract and retain talented employees our business is based on successfully attracting and retaining talented employees the market for highly skilled workers and leaders in our industry is extremely competitive we are limited in our ability to recruit internationally by restrictive domestic immigration laws if we are less successful in our recruiting efforts or if we cannot retain key employees our ability to develop and deliver successful products and services may be adversely affected effective succession planning is also important to our longterm success failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution how employmentrelated laws are interpreted and applied to our workforce practices may result in increased operating costs and less flexibility in how we meet our workforce needs 

we have claims and lawsuits against us that may result in adverse outcomes we are subject to a variety of claims and lawsuits these claims may arise from a wide variety of business practices and initiatives including major new product releases such as windows 10 significant business transactions and employment practices adverse outcomes in some or all of these claims may result in significant monetary damages or injunctive relief that could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business the litigation and other claims are subject to inherent uncertainties and management’s view of these matters may change in the future a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements could occur for the period in which the effect of an unfavorable final outcome becomes probable and reasonably estimable 

we may have additional tax liabilities we are subject to income taxes in the us and many foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes in the ordinary course of our business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain we regularly are under audit by tax authorities in different jurisdictions economic and political pressures to increase tax revenue in various jurisdictions may make resolving tax disputes favorably more difficult although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation in the jurisdictions where we are subject to taxation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals the results of an audit or litigation could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements in the period or periods in which that determination is made 

we earn a significant amount of our operating income from outside the us and any repatriation of funds currently held in foreign jurisdictions to the us may result in higher effective tax rates for the company in addition there have been proposals from congress to change us tax laws that would significantly impact how us multinational corporations are taxed on foreign earnings although we cannot predict whether or in what form any proposed legislation may pass if enacted it could have a material adverse impact on our tax expense and cash flows

our hardware and software products may experience quality or supply problems our verticallyintegrated hardware products such as xbox consoles surface devices phones and other devices we design manufacture and market are highly complex and can have defects in design manufacture or associated software we could incur significant expenses lost revenue and reputational harm if we fail to detect or address such issues through design testing or warranty repairs we acquire some device components from sole suppliers our competitors use some of the same suppliers and their demand for hardware components can affect the capacity available to us if a component from a solesource supplier is delayed or becomes unavailable whether because of supplier capacity constraint or industry shortages we may not obtain timely replacement supplies resulting in reduced sales component shortages excess or obsolete inventory or price reductions resulting in inventory adjustments may increase our cost of revenue xbox consoles surface devices phones and other hardware are assembled in asia and other geographies that may be subject to disruptions in the supply chain resulting in shortages that would affect our revenue and operating margins these same risks would apply to any other verticallyintegrated hardware and software products we may offer 

our software products also may experience quality or reliability problems the highly sophisticated software products we develop may contain bugs and other defects that interfere with their intended operation any defects we do not detect and fix in prerelease testing could cause reduced sales and revenue damage to our reputation repair or remediation costs delays in the release of new products or versions or legal liability although our license agreements typically contain provisions that eliminate or limit our exposure to liability there is no assurance these provisions will withstand legal challenge 

we strive to empower all people and organizations to achieve more and accessibility of our products is an important aspect of this goal there is increasing pressure from advocacy groups regulators competitors and customers to make technology more accessible if our products do not meet customer expectations or emerging global accessibility requirements we could lose sales opportunities or face regulatory actions 

our global business exposes us to operational and economic risks our customers are located in over 200 countries and a significant part of our revenue comes from international sales the global nature of our business creates operational and economic risks emerging markets are a significant focus of our international growth strategy the developing nature of these markets presents several risks including deterioration of social political labor or economic conditions in a country or region and difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations although we hedge a portion of our international currency exposure significant fluctuations in foreign exchange rates between the us dollar and foreign currencies may adversely affect our revenue competitive or regulatory pressure to make our pricing structure uniform might require that we reduce the sales price of our software in the us and other countries 

catastrophic events or geopolitical conditions may disrupt our business a disruption or failure of our systems or operations because of a major earthquake weather event cyberattack terrorist attack or other catastrophic event could cause delays in completing sales providing services or performing other critical functions our corporate headquarters a significant portion of our research and development activities and certain other essential business operations are in the seattle washington area and we have other business operations in the silicon valley area of california both of which are seismically active regions a catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our critical business or it systems could harm our ability to conduct normal business operations providing our customers with more services and solutions in the cloud puts a premium on the resilience of our systems and strength of our business continuity management plans and magnifies the potential impact of prolonged service outages on our operating results 

abrupt political change terrorist activity and armed conflict pose a risk of general economic disruption in affected countries which may increase our operating costs these conditions also may add uncertainty to the timing and budget for technology investment decisions by our customers and may cause supply chain disruptions for hardware manufacturers either of which may adversely affect our revenue the longterm effects of climate change on the global economy or the it industry in particular are unclear environmental regulations or changes in the supply demand or available sources of energy or other natural resources may affect the availability or cost of goods and services including natural resources necessary to run our business changes in weather where we operate may increase the costs of powering and cooling computer hardware we use to develop software and provide cloudbased services

adverse economic or market conditions may harm our business worsening economic conditions including inflation recession or other changes in economic conditions may cause lower it spending and adversely affect our revenue if demand for pcs servers and other computing devices declines or consumer or business spending for those products declines our revenue will be adversely affected substantial revenue comes from our us government contracts an extended federal government shutdown resulting from failing to pass budget appropriations adopt continuing funding resolutions or raise the debt ceiling and other budgetary decisions limiting or delaying federal government spending could reduce government it spending on our products and services and adversely affect our revenue 

our product distribution system relies on an extensive partner and retail network oems building devices that run our software have also been a significant means of distribution the impact of economic conditions on our partners such as the bankruptcy of a major distributor oem or retailer could cause sales channel disruption 

challenging economic conditions also may impair the ability of our customers to pay for products and services they have purchased as a result allowances for doubtful accounts and writeoffs of accounts receivable may increase 

we maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings types and maturities these investments are subject to general credit liquidity market and interest rate risks which may be exacerbated by unusual events that affect global financial markets a significant part of our investment portfolio comprises us government securities if global credit and equity markets decline for long periods or if there is a downgrade of the us government credit rating due to an actual or threatened default on government debt our investment portfolio may be adversely affected and we could determine that more of our investments have experienced an otherthantemporary decline in fair value requiring impairment charges that could adversely affect our financial results

 in june 2016 we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire linkedin for 196 per share in an allcash transaction valued at 262 billion inclusive of linkedin’s net cash the “merger agreement” we will finance the transaction primarily through the issuance of new indebtedness the merger agreement has been unanimously approved by the boards of directors of both microsoft and linkedin and we expect the acquisition will close in calendar year 2016 subject to approval by linkedin’s shareholders satisfaction of certain regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions the acquisition is anticipated to accelerate the growth of linkedin as well as office 365 and dynamics 

in may 2016 we announced the sale of our entrylevel feature phone business for 350 million the transaction is expected to close in the second half of 2016 subject to regulatory approvals and other closing conditions 

in july 2015 we announced a plan to restructure our phone business to better focus and align resources in may 2016 we announced plans to further streamline our smartphone hardware business these changes in the phone business reinforce our strategy to create a vibrant windows ecosystem with a single set of experiences across our firstparty device family and original equipment manufacturer “oem” offerings part of this strategy involves focusing our phone devices on a narrower range of customer categories and differentiating through the combination of hardware and software we are uniquely positioned to offer as anticipated our change in phone strategy resulted in a reduction in units sold and associated expenses in fiscal year 2016 and this trend is expected to continue in fiscal year 2017 

industry trends 

our industry is dynamic and highly competitive with frequent changes in both technologies and business models each industry shift is an opportunity to conceive new products new technologies or new ideas that can further transform the industry and our business at microsoft we push the boundaries of what is possible through a broad range of research and development activities that seek to identify and address the changing demands of customers and users industry trends and competitive forces 

economic conditions challenges and risks 

the market for software devices and cloudbased services is dynamic and highly competitive our competitors are developing new software and devices while also deploying competing cloudbased services for consumers and businesses the devices and form factors customers prefer evolve rapidly and influence how users access services in the cloud and in some cases the user’s choice of which suite of cloudbased services to use we must continue to evolve and adapt over an extended time in pace with this changing environment the investments we are making in devices and infrastructure will continue to increase our operating costs and may decrease our operating margins 

our success is highly dependent on our ability to attract and retain qualified employees we hire a mix of university and industry talent worldwide microsoft competes for talented individuals globally by offering an exceptional working environment broad customer reach scale in resources the ability to grow one’s career across many different products and businesses and competitive compensation and benefits aggregate demand for our software services and devices is correlated to global macroeconomic and geopolitical factors which remain dynamic

our international operations provide a significant portion of our total revenue and expenses many of these revenue and expenses are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar as a result changes in foreign exchange rates may significantly affect revenue and expenses the strengthening of the us dollar relative to certain foreign currencies throughout fiscal year 2015 and continuing into fiscal year 2016 negatively impacted reported revenue and reduced reported expenses from our international operations 

see a discussion of these factors and other risks under risk factors part i item 1a of this form 10k 

seasonality 

our revenue historically has fluctuated quarterly and has generally been highest in the second quarter of our fiscal year due to corporate calendar yearend spending trends in our major markets and holiday season spending by consumers 

unearned revenue 

quarterly and annual revenue is impacted by the deferral of revenue primarily including 

 

  

 if our customers choose to license cloudbased versions of our products and services rather than licensing transactionbased products and services the associated revenue will shift from being recognized at the time of the transaction to being recognized over the subscription period or upon consumption as applicable 

product revenue and service and other revenue 

due to the growth in our cloudbased solutions service revenue exceeded 10 of total revenue for the first time in fiscal year 2016 as a result we have separately disclosed product revenue and service and other revenue on our consolidated income statements 

product revenue includes sales from operating systems crossdevice productivity applications server applications business solution applications desktop and server management tools software development tools video games hardware such as pcs tablets gaming and entertainment consoles phones other intelligent devices and related accessories and training and certification of computer system integrators and developers 

service and other revenue includes sales from cloudbased solutions that provide customers with software services platforms and content such as office 365 azure dynamics crm online and xbox live solution support and consulting services service and other revenue also includes sales from online advertising

the components of other income expense net were as follows 

 

 we use derivative instruments to manage risks related to foreign currencies equity prices interest rates and credit enhance investment returns and facilitate portfolio diversification gains and losses from changes in fair values of derivatives that are not designated as hedges are primarily recognized in other income expense net other than those derivatives entered into for investment purposes such as commodity contracts the gains losses are generally economically offset by unrealized gains losses in the underlying availableforsale securities and gains losses on certain balance sheet amounts from foreign exchange rate changes 

fiscal year 2016 compared with fiscal year 2015 

dividends and interest income increased due to higher portfolio balances and slightly higher yields on fixedincome securities interest expense increased due to higher outstanding longterm debt net recognized gains on investments decreased primarily due to higher otherthantemporary impairments and lower gains on sales of fixedincome securities offset in part by higher gains on sales of equity securities otherthantemporary impairments were 322 million in fiscal year 2016 compared with 183 million in fiscal year 2015 net losses on derivatives increased due to higher losses on currency and equity contracts and lower gains on interest rate contracts in the current period as compared to the prior period offset in part by lower losses on commodity contracts for fiscal year 2016 other reflects recognized losses from divestitures and certain joint ventures

income taxes 

fiscal year 2016 compared with fiscal year 2015 

our effective tax rate for fiscal years 2016 and 2015 was 15 and 34 respectively our effective tax rate was lower than the us federal statutory rate primarily due to earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting from producing and distributing our products and services through our foreign regional operations centers in ireland singapore and puerto rico 

the decrease in our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2016 compared to fiscal year 2015 was primarily due to changes in the mix of our income before income taxes between the us and foreign countries including the impact of net

revenue deferrals related to sales of windows 10 tax benefits from the adoption of the new accounting guidance relating to stockbased compensation and distributions from foreign affiliates the fiscal year 2015 effective tax rate included the tax impact of losses in foreign jurisdictions for which we may not realize a tax benefit primarily as a result of impairment and restructuring charges 

the mix of income before income taxes between the us and foreign countries impacted our effective tax rate as a result of the geographic distribution of and customer demand for our products and services we supply our windows pc operating system to customers through our us regional operating center while we supply the microsoft office system and our server products and tools to customers through our foreign regional operations centers in fiscal year 2016 our us loss before income taxes was 325 million and our foreign income before income taxes was 201 billion net revenue deferrals related to sales of windows 10 negatively impacted our fiscal year 2016 us loss before income taxes by 60 billion and foreign income before income taxes by 588 million in fiscal year 2015 our us income before income taxes was 74 billion and our foreign income before income taxes was 111 billion impairment integration and restructuring expense relating to our phone business decreased our fiscal year 2015 us income before income taxes by 11 billion and foreign income before income taxes by 89 billion 

on july 27 2015 the us tax court issued an opinion in altera corp v commissioner related to the treatment of stockbased compensation expense in an intercompany costsharing arrangement the irs’s decision to appeal on february 19 2016 prolongs the uncertainty regarding the ultimate outcome of the altera case and we do not expect to adjust our consolidated financial statements until there is a final resolution of this case 

tax contingencies and other income tax liabilities were 118 billion and 121 billion as of june 30 2016 and 2015 respectively and are included in other longterm liabilities this decrease relates primarily to tax credits available for carryover and a partial settlement of the irs audit for tax years 2007 to 2009 offset by increases relating to intercompany transfer pricing 

while we settled a portion of the irs audit for tax years 2004 to 2006 during the third quarter of fiscal year 2011 and settled a portion of the irs audit for tax years 2007 to 2009 during the first quarter of fiscal year 2016 we remain under audit for those years in february 2012 the irs withdrew its 2011 revenue agents report for tax years 2004 to 2006 and reopened the audit phase of the examination as of june 30 2016 the primary unresolved issue relates to transfer pricing which could have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements if not resolved favorably we believe our allowances for income tax contingencies are adequate we have not received a proposed assessment for the unresolved issues and do not expect a final resolution of these issues in the next 12 months based on the information currently available we do not anticipate a significant increase or decrease to our tax contingencies for these issues within the next 12 months we also continue to be subject to examination by the irs for tax years 2010 to 2016 

we are subject to income tax in many jurisdictions outside the us our operations in certain jurisdictions remain subject to examination for tax years 1996 to 2016 some of which are currently under audit by local tax authorities the resolutions of these audits are not expected to be material to our consolidated financial statements 

fiscal year 2015 compared with fiscal year 2014 

our effective tax rate for fiscal years 2015 and 2014 was 34 and 21 respectively the fiscal year 2015 effective rate increased by 13 primarily due to goodwill and asset impairments and restructuring charges recorded in fiscal year 2015 most of which did not generate a tax benefit our effective tax rate was lower than the us federal statutory rate primarily due to foreign earnings taxed at lower rates resulting from producing and distributing our products and services through our foreign regional operations centers in ireland singapore and puerto rico in fiscal year 2015 this reduction was mostly offset by losses in foreign jurisdictions for which we may not realize a tax benefit primarily as a result of impairment and restructuring charges 

changes in the mix of income before income taxes between the us and foreign countries impacted our effective tax rate as a result of the geographic distribution of and customer demand for our products and services we supply our windows pc operating system to customers through our us regional operating center while we supply

of the cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments as of june 30 2016 1089 billion was held by our foreign subsidiaries and would be subject to material repatriation tax effects the amount of cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments held by foreign subsidiaries subject to other restrictions on the free flow of funds primarily currency and other local regulatory was 24 billion as of june 30 2016 approximately 83 of the cash equivalents and shortterm investments held by our foreign subsidiaries were invested in us government and agency securities approximately 4 were invested in corporate notes and bonds of us companies and approximately 5 were invested in us mortgage and assetbacked securities all of which are denominated in us dollars the remaining cash equivalents and shortterm investments held by our foreign subsidiaries were invested in foreign securities 

securities lending 

we lend certain fixedincome and equity securities to increase investment returns the loaned securities continue to be carried as investments on our consolidated balance sheets cash andor security interests are received as collateral for the loaned securities with the amount determined based upon the underlying security lent and the creditworthiness of the borrower collateral received is recorded as an asset with a corresponding liability our securities lending payable balance was 294 million as of june 30 2016 our average and maximum securities lending payable balances for fiscal year 2016 were 361 million and 12 billion respectively intrayear variances in the amount of securities loaned are mainly due to fluctuations in the demand for the securities 

valuation 

in general and where applicable we use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities to determine the fair value of our financial instruments this pricing methodology applies to our level 1 investments such as exchangetraded mutual funds domestic and international equities and us government securities if quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities are not available to determine fair value then we use quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities or inputs other than the quoted prices that are observable either directly or indirectly this pricing methodology applies to our level 2 investments such as corporate notes and bonds common and preferred stock foreign government bonds mortgage and assetbacked securities us government and agency securities and certificates of deposit level 3 investments are valued using internally developed models with unobservable inputs assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis using unobservable inputs are an immaterial portion of our portfolio 

  

  

part ii 

item 7 

  

a majority of our investments are priced by pricing vendors and are generally level 1 or level 2 investments as these vendors either provide a quoted market price in an active market or use observable inputs for their pricing without applying significant adjustments broker pricing is used mainly when a quoted price is not available the investment is not priced by our pricing vendors or when a broker price is more reflective of fair values in the market in which the investment trades our brokerpriced investments are generally classified as level 2 investments because the broker prices these investments based on similar assets without applying significant adjustments in addition all of our brokerpriced investments have a sufficient level of trading volume to demonstrate that the fair values used are appropriate for these investments our fair value processes include controls that are designed to ensure appropriate fair values are recorded these controls include model validation review of key model inputs analysis of periodoverperiod fluctuations and independent recalculation of prices where appropriate 

cash flows 

fiscal year 2016 compared with fiscal year 2015 

cash flows from operations increased 37 billion to 333 billion during the fiscal year mainly due to lower operating expenditures and a reduction in materials and production costs offset in part by a decrease in cash received from customers cash used in financing decreased 13 billion to 84 billion mainly due to a 46 billion increase in proceeds from issuances of debt net of repayments offset in part by a 15 billion increase in cash used for common stock repurchases and a 11 billion increase in dividends paid cash used in investing increased 949 million to 240 billion mainly due to a 24 billion increase in cash used for additions to property and equipment and a 15 billion increase in cash used for net investment purchases sales and maturities offset in part by a 23 billion decrease in cash used for acquisitions of companies net of cash acquired and purchases of intangibles and other assets 

fiscal year 2015 compared with fiscal year 2014 

cash flows from operations decreased 28 billion to 297 billion mainly due to an increase in materials and production costs in support of sales growth as well as payments related to restructuring charges and other changes in working capital offset in part by increases in cash received from customers cash used in financing increased 10 billion to 97 billion mainly due to a 71 billion increase in cash used for common stock repurchases offset in part by a 67 billion increase in proceeds from issuances of debt net of repayments cash used in investing increased 42 billion to 230 billion mainly due to a 55 billion increase in cash used for net investment purchases sales and maturities partially offset by a 22 billion decrease in cash used for acquisitions of companies net of cash acquired and purchases of intangible and other assets

     other planned uses of capital 

in june 2016 we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire linkedin in an allcash transaction valued at 262 billion inclusive of linkedin’s net cash we expect the acquisition will close in calendar year 2016 and we will finance the transaction primarily through the issuance of new debt 

we will continue to invest in sales marketing product support infrastructure and existing and advanced areas of technology as well as continue making acquisitions that align with our business strategy additions to property and equipment will continue including new facilities datacenters and computer systems for research and development sales and marketing support and administrative staff we expect capital expenditures to increase in coming years in support of our productivity and platform strategy we have operating leases for most us and international sales and support offices and certain equipment we have not engaged in any related party transactions or arrangements with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect liquidity or the availability of capital resources 

liquidity 

we earn a significant amount of our operating income outside the us which is deemed to be permanently reinvested in foreign jurisdictions as a result as discussed above under cash cash equivalents and investments the majority of our cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments are held by foreign subsidiaries we currently do not intend nor foresee a need to repatriate these funds we expect existing domestic cash cash equivalents shortterm investments cash flows from operations and access to capital markets to continue to be sufficient to fund our domestic operating activities and cash commitments for investing and financing activities such as regular quarterly dividends debt maturities and material capital expenditures for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future in addition we expect existing foreign cash cash equivalents shortterm investments and cash flows from operations to continue to be sufficient to fund our foreign operating activities and cash commitments for investing activities such as material capital expenditures for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future

should we require more capital in the us than is generated by our operations domestically for example to fund significant discretionary activities such as business acquisitions and share repurchases we could elect to repatriate future earnings from foreign jurisdictions or raise capital in the us through debt or equity issuances these alternatives could result in higher effective tax rates increased interest expense or dilution of our earnings we have borrowed funds domestically and continue to believe we have the ability to do so at reasonable interest rates 

recent accounting guidance 

see note 1 – accounting policies of the notes to financial statements part ii item 8 of this form 10k for further discussion 

application of critical accounting policies 

our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with us gaap preparing consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses these estimates and assumptions are affected by management’s application of accounting policies critical accounting policies for us include revenue recognition impairment of investment securities goodwill research and development costs contingencies income taxes and inventories 

revenue recognition 

revenue recognition for multipleelement arrangements requires judgment to determine if multiple elements exist whether elements can be accounted for as separate units of accounting and if so the fair value for each of the elements 

judgment is also required to assess whether future releases of certain software represent new products or upgrades and enhancements to existing products certain volume licensing arrangements include a perpetual license for current products combined with rights to receive unspecified future versions of software products and are accounted for as subscriptions with billings recorded as unearned revenue and recognized as revenue ratably over the coverage period 

software updates are evaluated on a casebycase basis to determine whether they meet the definition of an upgrade which may require revenue to be deferred and recognized when the upgrade is delivered if it is determined that implied postcontract customer support “pcs” is being provided revenue from the arrangement is deferred and recognized over the implied pcs term if updates are determined to not meet the definition of an upgrade revenue is generally recognized as products are shipped or made available 

microsoft enters into arrangements that can include various combinations of software services and hardware where elements are delivered over different periods of time and when allowed under us gaap revenue is allocated to the respective elements based on their relative selling prices at the inception of the arrangement and revenue is recognized as each element is delivered we use a hierarchy to determine the fair value to be used for allocating revenue to elements i vendorspecific objective evidence of fair value “vsoe” ii thirdparty evidence and iii best estimate of selling price “esp” for software elements we follow the industryspecific software guidance which only allows for the use of vsoe in establishing fair value generally vsoe is the price charged when the deliverable is sold separately or the price established by management for a product that is not yet sold if it is probable that the price will not change before introduction into the marketplace esps are established as best estimates of what the selling prices would be if the deliverables were sold regularly on a standalone basis our process for determining esps requires judgment and considers multiple factors that may vary over time depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each deliverable 

in january 2015 we announced windows 10 would be free to all qualified existing users of windows 7 and windows 81 this offer differs from historical offers preceding the launch of new versions of windows as it is being made 

  

  

part ii 

item 7 

  

available for free to existing users in addition to new customers after the offer announcement we evaluated the nature and accounting treatment of the windows 10 offer and determined that it represents a marketing and promotional activity in part because the offer is being made available for free to existing users as this is a marketing and promotional activity revenue recognition of new sales of windows 8 will continue to be recognized as delivered 

customers purchasing a windows 10 license will receive unspecified updates and upgrades over the life of their windows 10 device at no additional cost as these updates and upgrades will not be sold on a standalone basis we are unable to establish vsoe accordingly revenue from licenses of windows 10 is recognized ratably over the estimated life of the related device which ranges between two to four years 

we currently are evaluating the impact of the new standard related to revenue recognition which we anticipate will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements see note 1 – accounting policies of the notes to financial statements part ii item 8 of this form 10k for further discussion 

impairment of investment securities 

we review investments quarterly for indicators of otherthantemporary impairment this determination requires significant judgment in making this judgment we employ a systematic methodology quarterly that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments if the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value we evaluate among other factors general market conditions credit quality of debt instrument issuers the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost and for equity securities our intent and ability to hold or plans to sell the investment for fixedincome securities we also evaluate whether we have plans to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery we also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the investee including industry and sector performance changes in technology and operational and financing cash flow factors once a decline in fair value is determined to be otherthantemporary an impairment charge is recorded to other income expense net and a new cost basis in the investment is established if market industry andor investee conditions deteriorate we may incur future impairments 

goodwill 

we allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the business combination we evaluate our reporting units on an annual basis and if necessary reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level operating segment or one level below an operating segment on an annual basis may 1 for us and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value these events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate legal factors operating performance indicators competition or sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit 

application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment including the identification of reporting units assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units assignment of goodwill to reporting units and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit the fair value of each reporting unit is estimated primarily through the use of a discounted cash flow methodology this analysis requires significant judgments including estimation of future cash flows which is dependent on internal forecasts estimation of the longterm rate of growth for our business estimation of the useful life over which cash flows will occur and determination of our weighted average cost of capital 

the estimates used to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit change from year to year based on operating results market conditions and other factors changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and goodwill impairment for each reporting unit

research and development costs 

costs incurred internally in researching and developing a computer software product are charged to expense until technological feasibility has been established for the product once technological feasibility is established all software costs are capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers judgment is required in determining when technological feasibility of a product is established we have determined that technological feasibility for our software products is reached after all highrisk development issues have been resolved through coding and testing generally this occurs shortly before the products are released to manufacturing the amortization of these costs is included in cost of revenue over the estimated life of the products 

legal and other contingencies 

the outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought against us are subject to significant uncertainty an estimated loss from a loss contingency such as a legal proceeding or claim is accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated in determining whether a loss should be accrued we evaluate among other factors the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss changes in these factors could materially impact our consolidated financial statements 

income taxes 

the objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity’s financial statements or tax returns we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement accounting literature also provides guidance on derecognition of income tax assets and liabilities classification of deferred income tax assets and liabilities accounting for interest and penalties associated with tax positions and income tax disclosures judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized on our consolidated financial statements or tax returns variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our consolidated financial statements 

inventories 

inventories are stated at average cost subject to the lower of cost or market cost includes materials labor and manufacturing overhead related to the purchase and production of inventories we regularly review inventory quantities on hand future purchase commitments with our suppliers and the estimated utility of our inventory these reviews include analysis of demand forecasts product life cycle status product development plans current sales levels pricing strategy and component cost trends if our review indicates a reduction in utility below carrying value we reduce our inventory to a new cost basis through a charge to cost of revenue

risks 

we are exposed to economic risk from foreign exchange rates interest rates credit risk equity prices and commodity prices a portion of these risks is hedged but they may impact our consolidated financial statements 

foreign currency 

certain forecasted transactions assets and liabilities are exposed to foreign currency risk we monitor our foreign currency exposures daily and use hedges where practicable to offset the risks and maximize the economic effectiveness of our foreign currency positions principal currencies hedged include the euro japanese yen british pound canadian dollar and australian dollar 

interest rate 

our fixedincome portfolio is diversified across credit sectors and maturities consisting primarily of investmentgrade securities the credit risk and average maturity of the fixedincome portfolio is managed to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain global and domestic fixedincome indices in addition we use “to be announced” forward purchase commitments of mortgagebacked assets to gain exposure to agency mortgagebacked securities 

equity 

our equity portfolio consists of global developed and emerging market securities that are subject to market price risk we manage the securities relative to certain global and domestic indices and expect their economic risk and return to correlate with these indices 

commodity 

we use broadbased commodity exposures to enhance portfolio returns and facilitate portfolio diversification our investment portfolio has exposure to a variety of commodities including precious metals energy and grain we manage these exposures relative to global commodity indices and expect their economic risk and return to correlate with these indices 

valueatrisk 

we use a valueatrisk “var” model to estimate and quantify our market risks var is the expected loss for a given confidence level in the fair value of our portfolio due to adverse market movements over a defined time horizon the var model is not intended to represent actual losses in fair value including determinations of otherthantemporary losses in fair value in accordance with us gaap but is used as a risk estimation and management tool the distribution of the potential changes in total market value of all holdings is computed based on the historical volatilities and correlations among foreign exchange rates interest rates equity prices and commodity prices assuming normal market conditions 

the var is calculated as the total loss that will not be exceeded at the 975 percentile confidence level or alternatively stated the losses could exceed the var in 25 out of 1000 cases several risk factors are not captured in the model including liquidity risk operational risk and legal risk

the ambitions that drive us 

to carry out our strategy our research and development efforts focus on three interconnected ambitions 

 

  

  

 reinvent productivity and business processes 

we believe we can significantly enhance the lives of our customers using our broad portfolio of communication productivity and information services that spans devices and platforms productivity will be the first and foremost objective to enable people to meet and collaborate more easily and to effectively express ideas in new ways we will design applications as dualuse with the intelligence to partition data between work and life while respecting each person’s privacy choices the foundation for these efforts will rest on advancing our leading productivity collaboration and business process tools including skype onedrive onenote outlook word excel powerpoint bing and dynamics with office 365 we provide these familiar industryleading productivity and business process tools as cloud services enabling access from anywhere and any device this creates an opportunity to reach new customers and expand the usage of our services by our existing customers 

we see opportunity in combining our offerings in new ways that are more contextual and personal while ensuring people rather than their devices remain at the center of the digital experience we will offer our services across ecosystems and devices outside our own as people move from device to device so will their content and the richness of their services we are engineering our applications so users can find try and buy them in frictionfree ways 

build the intelligent cloud platform 

in deploying technology that advances business strategy enterprises decide what solutions will make employees more productive collaborative and satisfied and connect with customers in new and compelling ways they work to unlock business insights from a world of data to achieve these objectives increasingly businesses look to leverage the benefits of the cloud helping businesses move to the cloud is one of our largest opportunities and we believe we work from a position of strength 

the shift to the cloud is driven by three important economies of scale larger datacenters can deploy computational resources at significantly lower cost per unit than smaller ones larger datacenters can coordinate and aggregate diverse customer geographic and application demand patterns improving the utilization of computing storage and network resources and multitenancy lowers application maintenance labor costs for large public clouds as one of the largest providers of cloud computing at scale we are wellpositioned to help businesses move to the cloud so that businesses can focus on innovation while leaving nondifferentiating activities to reliable and costeffective providers like microsoft 

with azure we are one of very few cloud vendors that run at a scale that meets the needs of businesses of all sizes and complexities we believe the combination of azure and windows server makes us the only company with a public private and hybrid cloud platform that can power modern business we are working to enhance the return on information technology “it” investment by enabling enterprises to combine their existing datacenters and our public cloud into a single cohesive infrastructure businesses can deploy applications in their own datacenter a partner’s datacenter or in our datacenters with common security management and administration across all environments with the flexibility and scale they want 

we enable organizations to securely adopt softwareasaservice applications both our own and thirdparty and integrate them with their existing security and management infrastructure we will continue to innovate with higherlevel services including identity and directory services that manage employee corporate identity and manage and secure corporate information accessed and stored across a growing number of devices rich data storage and analytics services machine learning services media services web and mobile backend services and developer

item 1 

  

productivity services to foster a rich developer ecosystem our digital work and life experiences will also be extensible enabling customers and partners to further customize and enhance our solutions achieving even more value this strategy requires continuing investment in datacenters and other infrastructure to support our devices and services 

create more personal computing 

windows 10 is the cornerstone of our ambition to usher in an era of more personal computing we see the launch of windows 10 in july 2015 as a critical transformative moment for the company because we will move from an operating system that runs on a pc to a service that can power the full spectrum of devices in our customers’ lives we developed windows 10 not only to be familiar to our users but more safe and secure and always uptodate we believe windows 10 is more personal and productive working seamlessly with functionality such as cortana office continuum and universal applications we designed windows 10 to foster innovation – from us our partners and developers – through experiences such as our new browser microsoft edge across the range of existing devices and into entirely new device categories 

our ambition for windows 10 is to broaden our economic opportunity through three key levers an original equipment manufacturer “oem” ecosystem that creates exciting new hardware designs for windows 10 our own commitment to the health and profitability of our firstparty premium device portfolio and monetization opportunities such as services subscriptions gaming and search our oem partners are investing in an extensive portfolio of hardware designs and configurations as they ready for windows 10 by december 2015 we anticipate the widest range of windows hardware ever to be available 

with the launch of windows 10 we are realizing our vision of a single unified windows operating system on which developers and oems can contribute to a thriving windows ecosystem we invest heavily to make windows the most secure manageable and capable operating system for the needs of a modern workforce we are working to create a broad developer opportunity by unifying the installed base to windows 10 through upgrades and ongoing updates and by enabling universal windows applications to run across all device targets as part of our strategic objectives we are committed to designing and marketing firstparty devices to help drive innovation create new categories and stimulate demand in the windows ecosystem including across pcs phones tablets consoles wearables large multitouch displays and new categories such as the hololens holographic computing platform we are developing new inputoutput methods like speech pen gesture and augmented reality holograms to power more personal computing experiences with windows 10 

our future opportunity 

there are several distinct areas of technology that we aim to drive forward our goal is to lead the industry in these areas over the longterm which we expect will translate to sustained growth we are investing significant resources in 

 

  

  

  

  

 we believe the breadth of our products and services portfolio our large global partner and customer base our growing ecosystem and our ongoing investment in innovation position us to be a leader in these areas and differentiate ourselves from competitors

research and development 

during fiscal years 2015 2014 and 2013 research and development expense was 120 billion 114 billion and 104 billion respectively these amounts represented 13 of revenue in each of those years we plan to continue to make significant investments in a broad range of research and development efforts 

product and service development and intellectual property 

we develop most of our products and services internally through three engineering groups 

 

  

  

 internal development allows us to maintain competitive advantages that come from product differentiation and closer technical control over our products and services it also gives us the freedom to decide which modifications and enhancements are most important and when they should be implemented we strive to obtain information as early as possible about changing usage patterns and hardware advances that may affect software design before releasing new software platforms we provide application vendors with a range of resources and guidelines for development training and testing generally we also create product documentation internally 

we protect our intellectual property investments in a variety of ways we work actively in the us and internationally to ensure the enforcement of copyright trademark trade secret and other protections that apply to our software and hardware products services business plans and branding we are a leader among technology companies in pursuing patents and currently have a portfolio of over 57000 us and international patents issued and over 35000 pending while we employ much of our internally developed intellectual property exclusively in microsoft products and services we also engage in outbound and inbound licensing of specific patented technologies that are incorporated into licensees’ or microsoft’s products from time to time we enter into broader crosslicense agreements with other technology companies covering entire groups of patents we also purchase or license technology that we incorporate into our products or services at times we make select intellectual property broadly available at no or low cost to achieve a strategic objective such as promoting industry standards advancing interoperability or attracting and enabling our external development community 

while it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of our products and business methods we believe based upon past experience and industry practice such licenses generally could be obtained on commercially reasonable terms we believe our continuing research and product development are not materially dependent on any single license or other agreement with a third party relating to the development of our products

investing in the future 

microsoft’s success is based on our ability to create new and compelling products services and experiences for our users to initiate and embrace disruptive technology trends to enter new geographic and product markets and to drive broad adoption of our products and services we invest in a range of emerging technology trends and breakthroughs that we believe offer significant opportunities to deliver value to our customers and growth for the company based on our assessment of key technology trends and our broad focus on longterm research and development we maintain our longterm commitment to research and development across a wide spectrum of technologies tools and platforms spanning digital work and life experiences cloud computing and devices operating systems and hardware 

while our main research and development facilities are located in redmond washington we also operate research and development facilities in other parts of the us and around the world including canada china denmark finland france germany india ireland israel japan and the united kingdom among others this global approach helps us remain competitive in local markets and enables us to continue to attract top talent from across the world we generally fund research at the corporate level to ensure that we are looking beyond immediate product considerations to opportunities further in the future we also fund research and development activities at the business segment level much of our business segment level research and development is coordinated with other segments and leveraged across the company 

in addition to our main research and development operations we also operate microsoft research microsoft research is one of the world’s largest computer science research organizations and works in close collaboration with top universities around the world to advance the stateoftheart in computer science providing us a unique perspective on future technology trends and contributing to our innovation 

distribution sales and marketing 

we market and distribute our products and services through the following channels oems distributors and resellers online and microsoft retail stores our sales force performs a variety of functions including working directly with enterprises and public sector organizations worldwide to identify and meet their software requirements managing oem relationships and supporting solution integrators independent software vendors and other partners who engage directly with our customers to perform sales consulting and fulfillment functions for our products 

oems 

we distribute software through oems that preinstall our software on new pcs tablets servers phones and other intelligent devices that they sell the largest component of the oem business is the windows operating system preinstalled on computing devices oems also sell hardware preinstalled with other microsoft products including server and embedded operating systems and applications such as our microsoft office suite in addition to these products we also market our services through oems and service bundles such as windows with bing or windows with office 365 subscription 

there are two broad categories of oems the largest oems many of which operate globally are referred to as “direct oems” as our relationship with them is managed through a direct agreement between microsoft and the oem we have distribution agreements covering one or more of our products with virtually all of the multinational oems including acer asustek dell fujitsu hewlettpackard lenovo samsung toshiba and with many regional and local oems the second broad category of oems consists of lowervolume pc manufacturers also called “system builders” which source their microsoft software for preinstallation and local redistribution primarily through the microsoft distributor channel rather than through a direct agreement or relationship with microsoft 

distributors and resellers 

many organizations that license our products and services through enterprise agreements transact directly with us with sales support from solution integrators independent software vendors web agencies and developers that advise organizations on licensing our products and services “enterprise agreement direct advisors” or “edas”

organizations also license our products and services indirectly primarily through license solutions partners “lsps” distributors valueadded resellers “vars” oems system builder channels and retailers although each type of reselling partner reaches organizations of all sizes lsps are primarily engaged with large organizations distributors resell primarily to vars and vars typically reach smallsized and mediumsized organizations edas typically are also authorized as lsps and operate as resellers for our other licensing programs such as the select plus and open licensing programs discussed under “licensing options” below some of our distributors include ingram micro and tech data and some of our largest resellers include cdw dell insight enterprises and software house international 

our microsoft dynamics software offerings are also licensed to enterprises through a global network of channel partners providing vertical solutions and specialized services we distribute our retail packaged products primarily through independent nonexclusive distributors authorized replicators resellers and retail outlets individual consumers obtain these products primarily through retail outlets including microsoft retail stores we distribute our hardware products including surface xbox phones and pc accessories through thirdparty retailers and microsoft retail stores our phones are also distributed through global wireless communications carriers we have a network of field sales representatives and field support personnel that solicits orders from distributors and resellers and provides product training and sales support 

online 

although onpremises software continues to be an important part of our business increasingly we are delivering additional value to customers through cloudbased services we provide online content services to consumers through bing msn portals and channels office 365 windows phone store xbox live outlookcom onedrive skype and windows store we also provide commercial cloudbased services such as dynamics crm online microsoft azure and office 365 other services delivered online include our online advertising platform with offerings for advertisers and publishers as well as microsoft developer network subscription content and updates periodic product updates and online technical and practice readiness resources to support our partners in developing and selling our products and solutions as we increasingly deliver online services we sell many of these cloudbased services through our enterprise agreements and have also enabled new sales programs to reach small and mediumsized businesses these programs include direct sales direct sales supported by a large network of partner advisors and resale of services through operator channels such as telephone cell and cable providers 

we also sell our products through our microsoft retail stores and online marketplaces 

licensing options 

we license software to organizations under agreements that allow the customer to acquire multiple licenses of products and services our agreements for organizations to acquire multiple licenses of products and services are designed to provide them with a means of doing so without having to acquire separate licenses through retail channels in delivering organizational licensing agreements to the market we use different programs designed to provide flexibility for organizations of various sizes while these programs may differ in various parts of the world generally they include those discussed below 

customer licensing programs 

open licensing 

designed primarily for smalltomedium organizations the open programs allow customers to acquire perpetual or subscription licenses and at the customer’s election rights to future versions of software products over a specified time period two or three years depending on the open programs used the offering that conveys rights to future versions of certain software products over the contract period is called software assurance software assurance also provides support tools and training to help customers deploy and use software efficiently the open programs have several variations to fit customers’ diverse ways of purchasing under the open license program customers can acquire licenses only or licenses with software assurance andor renew software assurance upon the expiration

of other existing volume licensing agreements under the open value and open value subscription programs customers can acquire perpetual or subscription licenses respectively over a threeyear period online services are available in each of the open programs 

microsoft product and services agreement 

suited for mediumtolarge organizations the microsoft products and services agreement “mpsa” provides customers the ability to purchase online services subscriptions software licenses software licenses with software assurance and renewals of software assurance through a single agreement software assurance and online services subscriptions are generally available up to three years 

select plus licensing 

designed primarily for mediumtolarge organizations the select plus program allows customers to acquire perpetual licenses and at the customer’s election software assurance over a specified time period generally three years or less similar to open programs the select plus program allows customers to acquire licenses only acquire licenses with software assurance or renew software assurance upon the expiration of existing volume licensing agreements a subset of online services are also available for purchase through the select plus program and subscriptions are generally structured with terms between one and three years in july 2014 we announced that we would no longer sign new select plus agreements with commercial organizations starting july 2015 and encouraged customers who want to purchase licenses to transition to the mpsa we expect select plus business to transition to the mpsa within a few years 

enterprise agreement licensing 

designed primarily for medium and largesized organizations that want to acquire licenses to online services andor software products along with software assurance and obtain the best value by standardizing on a common it platform across the organization enterprises can elect to acquire perpetual licenses or under the enterprise subscription option can acquire nonperpetual subscription licenses for a specified period generally three years online services are also available for purchase through the enterprise agreement and subscriptions are generally structured with threeyear terms 

customer licensing programs — online services only 

microsoft online subscription agreement is designed to enable small and mediumsized businesses to easily purchase microsoft online services the program allows customers to acquire monthly or annual subscriptions for cloudbased services 

partner programs 

the microsoft cloud solution provider program enables partners to directly manage their entire microsoft cloud customer lifecycle partners in this program use dedicated inproduct tools to directly provision manage and support their customer subscriptions partners can easily package their own tools products and services and combine them into one monthly or annual customer bill 

the microsoft services provider license agreement is a program targeted at service providers and independent software vendors allowing these partners to provide software services and hosted applications to their end customers agreements are generally structured with a threeyear term and partners are billed monthly based upon consumption 

microsoft online services reseller agreement is a program enabling partners to package microsoft online services with the partners’ services 

independent software vendor royalty program is a program that enables partners to use microsoft software in their own software programs

 item 1a risk factors 

our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties including those described below that could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations cash flows and the trading price of our common stock 

we face intense competition across all markets for our products and services which may lead to lower revenue or operating margins 

competition in the technology sector 

our competitors range in size from diversified global companies with significant research and development resources to small specialized firms whose narrower product lines may let them be more effective in deploying technical marketing and financial resources barriers to entry in many of our businesses are low and many of the areas in which we compete evolve rapidly with changing and disruptive technologies shifting user needs and frequent introductions of new products and services our ability to remain competitive depends on our success in making innovative products devices and services that appeal to businesses and consumers 

competition among platforms ecosystems and devices 

an important element of our business model has been to create platformbased ecosystems on which many participants can build diverse solutions a wellestablished ecosystem creates beneficial network effects among users application developers and the platform provider that can accelerate growth establishing significant scale in the marketplace is necessary to achieve and maintain attractive margins we face significant competition from firms that provide competing platforms applications and services

business model competition 

companies compete with us based on a growing variety of business models 

 

  

  

 the competitive pressures described above may cause decreased sales volumes price reductions andor increased operating costs such as for research and development marketing and sales incentives this may lead to lower revenue gross margins and operating income 

our increasing focus on services presents execution and competitive risks a growing part of our business involves cloudbased services available across the spectrum of computing devices our strategic vision is to compete and grow as a productivity and platform company for the mobilefirst and cloudfirst world at the same time our competitors are rapidly developing and deploying cloudbased services for consumers and business customers pricing and delivery models are evolving devices and form factors influence how users access services in the cloud and sometimes the user’s choice of which suite of cloudbased services to use we are devoting significant resources to develop and deploy our cloudbased strategies the windows ecosystem must continue to evolve with this changing environment we are undertaking cultural and organizational changes to drive accountability and eliminate obstacles to innovation the company’s increasing reliance on datadriven insights is becoming more important to the success of key opportunities in monetization customer perceptions of quality and operational efficiency besides software development costs we are incurring costs to build and maintain infrastructure to support cloud computing services these costs will reduce the operating margins we have previously achieved whether we succeed in cloudbased services depends on our execution in several areas including 

 

  

  

  

  

 it is uncertain whether our strategies will attract the users or generate the revenue required to succeed if we are not effective in executing organizational and technical changes to increase efficiency and accelerate innovation or if we fail to generate sufficient usage of our new products and services we may not grow revenue in line with the infrastructure and development investments described above this may negatively impact gross margins and operating income

we make significant investments in new products and services that may not achieve expected returns we will continue to make significant investments in research development and marketing for existing products services and technologies including the windows operating system the microsoft office system bing windows phone windows server the windows store the microsoft azure services platform office 365 other cloudbased services offerings and the xbox entertainment platform we also invest in the development and acquisition of a variety of hardware for productivity communication and entertainment including pcs tablets phones and gaming devices investments in new technology are speculative commercial success depends on many factors including innovativeness developer support and effective distribution and marketing if customers do not perceive our latest offerings as providing significant new functionality or other value they may reduce their purchases of new software and hardware products or upgrades unfavorably affecting revenue we may not achieve significant revenue from new product service and distribution channel investments for several years if at all new products and services may not be profitable and even if they are profitable operating margins for some new products and businesses will not be as high as the margins we have experienced historically 

the launch of windows 10 with free upgrades available to existing users of windows 7 and 81 constitutes the most ambitious update effort we have ever undertaken we have done extensive preparation and compatibility testing for applications and devices to help ensure a positive experience for our users installing windows 10 however if users have a negative upgrade experience or the community reacts negatively to the process we are following to promote and undertake the upgrades the reception of windows 10 in the marketplace may be harmed in addition we anticipate that windows 10 will enable new postlicense monetization opportunities beyond initial license revenues our failure to realize these opportunities to the extent we expect could have an adverse impact on our revenues 

developing new technologies is complex it can require long development and testing periods significant delays in new releases or significant problems in creating new products or services could adversely affect our revenue 

acquisitions joint ventures and strategic alliances may have an adverse effect on our business we expect to continue making acquisitions and entering into joint ventures and strategic alliances as part of our longterm business strategy these transactions and arrangements involve significant challenges and risks including that they do not advance our business strategy that we get an unsatisfactory return on our investment that we have difficulty integrating new employees business systems and technology or that they distract management from our other businesses if an arrangement fails to adequately anticipate changing circumstances and interests of a party it may result in early termination or renegotiation of the arrangement the success of these transactions and arrangements will depend in part on our ability to leverage them to enhance our existing products and services or develop compelling new ones it may take longer than expected to realize the full benefits from these transactions and arrangements such as increased revenue enhanced efficiencies or increased market share or the benefits may ultimately be smaller than we expected these events could adversely affect our operating results or financial condition 

if our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets become impaired we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings we acquire other companies and intangible assets and may not realize all the economic benefit from those acquisitions which could cause an impairment of goodwill or intangibles we review our amortizable intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable we test goodwill for impairment at least annually factors that may be a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets may not be recoverable include a decline in our stock price and market capitalization reduced future cash flow estimates and slower growth rates in industry segments in which we participate we may be required to record a significant charge in our consolidated financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets is determined negatively affecting our results of operations for example in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2012 we recorded a 62 billion charge for the impairment of goodwill in our previous online services division business devices and consumer other under our current segment structure and in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015 we recorded a 51 billion charge for the impairment of goodwill and a 22 billion charge for the impairment of intangible assets in our phone hardware segment

we may not earn the revenues we expect from our intellectual property rights 

we may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property rights 

protecting our global intellectual property rights and combating unlicensed copying and use of our software and other intellectual property is difficult while piracy adversely affects us revenue the impact on revenue from outside the us is more significant particularly in countries where laws are less protective of intellectual property rights our revenue in these markets may grow slower than the underlying device market similarly the absence of harmonized patent laws makes it more difficult to ensure consistent respect for patent rights throughout the world we educate consumers about the benefits of licensing genuine products and obtaining indemnification benefits for intellectual property risks and we educate lawmakers about the advantages of a business climate where intellectual property rights are protected reductions in the legal protection for software intellectual property rights could adversely affect revenue 

we may not receive expected royalties from our patent licenses 

we expend significant resources to patent the intellectual property we create with the expectation that we will generate revenues by incorporating that intellectual property in our products or services or in some instances by licensing our patents to others in return for a royalty changes in the law may weaken our ability to prevent the use of patented technology or collect revenue for licensing our patents these include legislative changes and regulatory actions that make it more difficult to obtain injunctions and the increasing use of legal process to challenge issued patents similarly licensees of our patents may fail to satisfy their obligations to pay us royalties or may contest the scope and extent of their obligations finally the royalties we can obtain to monetize our intellectual property may decline because of the evolution of technology selling price changes in products using licensed patents or the difficulty of discovering infringements 

third parties may claim we infringe their intellectual property rights from time to time others claim we infringe their intellectual property rights the number of these claims may grow because of constant technological change in the markets in which we compete the extensive patent coverage of existing technologies the rapid rate of issuance of new patents and our offering of firstparty devices such as surface and lumia phones to resolve these claims we may enter into royalty and licensing agreements on terms that are less favorable than currently available stop selling or redesign affected products or services or pay damages to satisfy indemnification commitments with our customers these outcomes may cause operating margins to decline besides money damages in some jurisdictions plaintiffs can seek injunctive relief that may limit or prevent importing marketing and selling our products or services that have infringing technologies in some countries such as germany an injunction can be issued before the parties have fully litigated the validity of the underlying patents we have paid significant amounts to settle claims related to the use of technology and intellectual property rights and to procure intellectual property rights as part of our strategy to manage this risk and may continue to do so 

we may not be able to protect our source code from copying if there is an unauthorized disclosure of source code source code the detailed program commands for our operating systems and other software programs is critical to our business although we license portions of our application and operating system source code to several licensees we take significant measures to protect the secrecy of large portions of our source code if a significant portion of our source code leaks we might lose future trade secret protection for that source code it may become easier for third parties to compete with our products by copying functionality which could adversely affect our revenue and operating margins unauthorized disclosure of source code also could increase the security risks described in the next paragraph

cyberattacks and security vulnerabilities could lead to reduced revenue increased costs liability claims or harm to our competitive position 

security of microsoft’s information technology 

threats to it security can take a variety of forms individual and groups of hackers and sophisticated organizations including statesponsored organizations or nationstates themselves may take steps that pose threats to our customers and our it they may develop and deploy malicious software to attack our products and services and gain access to our networks and datacenters or act in a coordinated manner to launch distributed denial of service or other coordinated attacks cyber threats are constantly evolving thereby increasing the difficulty of detecting and successfully defending against them cyber threats can have cascading impacts that unfold with increasing speed across our internal networks and systems and those of our partners and customers breaches of our network or data security could disrupt the security of our internal systems and business applications impair our ability to provide services to our customers and protect the privacy of their data result in product development delays compromise confidential or technical business information harming our competitive position result in theft or misuse of our intellectual property or other assets require us to allocate more resources to improved technologies or otherwise adversely affect our business 

in addition our internal it environment continues to evolve often we are early adopters of new devices and technologies we embrace new ways of sharing data and communicating internally and with partners and customers using methods such as social networking and other consumeroriented technologies our business policies and internal security controls may not keep pace with these changes as new threats emerge 

security of our products services devices and customers’ data 

security threats are a particular challenge to companies like us whose business is technology products and services threats to our own it infrastructure can also affect our customers customers using our cloudbased services rely on the security of our infrastructure to ensure the reliability of our services and the protection of their data hackers tend to focus their efforts on the most popular operating systems programs and services including many of ours and we expect that to continue the security of our products and services is important in our customers’ purchasing decisions 

to defend against security threats both to our internal it systems and those of our customers we must continuously engineer more secure products and services enhance security and reliability features improve the deployment of software updates to address security vulnerabilities develop mitigation technologies that help to secure customers from attacks even when software updates are not deployed maintain the digital security infrastructure that protects the integrity of our network products and services and provide customers security tools such as firewalls and antivirus software 

the cost of these steps could reduce our operating margins if we fail to do these things well actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products and services could harm our reputation and lead customers to reduce or delay future purchases of products or subscriptions to services or to use competing products or services customers may also spend more on protecting their existing computer systems from attack which could delay adoption of additional products or services customers may fail to update their systems continue to run software or operating systems we no longer support or may fail timely to install security patches any of these actions by customers could adversely affect our revenue actual or perceived vulnerabilities may lead to claims against us although our license agreements typically contain provisions that eliminate or limit our exposure to liability there is no assurance these provisions will withstand legal challenges legislative or regulatory action in these areas may increase the costs to develop implement or secure our products and services 

disclosure of personal data could cause liability and harm our reputation as we continue to grow the number and scale of our cloudbased offerings we store and process increasingly large amounts of personally identifiable information of our customers the continued occurrence of highprofile data breaches provides evidence of an external environment increasingly hostile to information security despite our efforts to improve the security controls across our business groups and geographies it is possible our security controls over personal data our

training of employees and vendors on data security and other practices we follow may not prevent the improper disclosure of customer data we or our vendors store and manage improper disclosure could harm our reputation lead to legal exposure to customers or subject us to liability under laws that protect personal data resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue our software products and services also enable our customers to store and process personal data onpremises or increasingly in a cloudbased environment we host government authorities can sometimes require us to produce customer data in response to valid legal orders in the us and elsewhere we advocate for transparency concerning these requests and appropriate limitations on government authority to compel disclosure despite our efforts to protect customer data perceptions that the privacy of personal information is not satisfactorily protected could inhibit sales of our products or services and could limit adoption of our cloudbased solutions by consumers businesses and government entities additional security measures we may take to address customer concerns or constraints on our flexibility to determine where and how to operate datacenters in response to customer expectations or governmental rules or actions may cause higher operating expenses 

we may have outages data losses and disruptions of our online services if we fail to maintain an adequate operations infrastructure our increasing user traffic growth in services and the complexity of our products and services demand more computing power we spend substantial amounts to build purchase or lease datacenters and equipment and to upgrade our technology and network infrastructure to handle more traffic on our websites and in our datacenters these demands continue to increase as we introduce new products and services and support the growth of existing services such as bing exchange online office 365 sharepoint online onedrive skype xbox live microsoft azure outlookcom windows stores and microsoft account services we are rapidly growing our business of providing a platform and backend hosting for services provided by third parties to their end users maintaining securing and expanding this infrastructure is expensive and complex it requires that we maintain an internet connectivity infrastructure that is robust and reliable within competitive and regulatory constraints that continue to evolve inefficiencies or operational failures including temporary or permanent loss of customer data or insufficient internet connectivity could diminish the quality of our products services and user experience resulting in contractual liability claims by customers and other third parties damage to our reputation and loss of current and potential users subscribers and advertisers each of which may harm our operating results and financial condition 

government litigation and regulatory activity relating to competition rules may limit how we design and market our products as a leading global software and device maker we are closely scrutinized by government agencies under us and foreign competition laws an increasing number of governments are regulating competition law activities and this includes increased scrutiny in potentially large markets such as the european union the us and china some jurisdictions also allow competitors or consumers to assert claims of anticompetitive conduct us federal and state antitrust authorities have previously brought enforcement actions and continue to scrutinize our business 

the european commission “the commission” closely scrutinizes the design of highvolume microsoft products and the terms on which we make certain technologies used in these products such as file formats programming interfaces and protocols available to other companies in 2004 the commission ordered us to create new versions of our windows operating system that do not include certain multimedia technologies and to provide our competitors with specifications for how to implement certain proprietary windows communications protocols in their own products in 2009 the commission accepted a set of commitments offered by microsoft to address the commission’s concerns relating to competition in web browsing software including an undertaking to address commission concerns relating to interoperability the web browsing commitments expired in 2014 the remaining obligations may limit our ability to innovate in windows or other products in the future diminish the developer appeal of the windows platform and increase our product development costs the availability of licenses related to protocols and file formats may enable competitors to develop software products that better mimic the functionality of our products which could hamper sales of our products 

our portfolio of firstparty devices continues to grow at the same time our oem partners offer a large variety of devices on our platforms as a result increasingly we both cooperate and compete with our oem partners creating a risk that we fail to do so in compliance with competition rules regulatory scrutiny in this area may increase certain foreign governments particularly in china and other countries in asia have advanced arguments under their competition laws that exert downward pressure on royalties for our intellectual property because these jurisdictions only recently implemented competition laws their enforcement activities are unpredictable 

  

  

part i 

item 1a 

  

government regulatory actions and court decisions such as these may hinder our ability to provide the benefits of our software to consumers and businesses reducing the attractiveness of our products and the revenue that come from them new competition law actions could be initiated the outcome of such actions or steps taken to avoid them could adversely affect us in a variety of ways including 

 

  

  

  

  

 our global operations subject us to potential liability under anticorruption trade protection and other laws and regulations the foreign corrupt practices act and other anticorruption laws and regulations “anticorruption laws” prohibit corrupt payments by our employees vendors or agents from time to time we receive inquiries from authorities in the us and elsewhere about our business activities outside the us and our compliance with anticorruption laws while we devote substantial resources to our global compliance programs and have implemented policies training and internal controls designed to reduce the risk of corrupt payments our employees vendors or agents may violate our policies our failure to comply with anticorruption laws could result in significant fines and penalties criminal sanctions against us our officers or our employees prohibitions on the conduct of our business and damage to our reputation operations outside the us may be affected by changes in trade protection laws policies and measures and other regulatory requirements affecting trade and investment we may be subject to legal liability and reputational damage if we sell goods or services in violation of us trade sanctions on countries such as iran north korea cuba sudan and syria 

other regulatory areas that may apply to our products and online services offerings include user privacy telecommunications data storage and protection and online content for example regulators may take the position that our offerings such as skype are covered by laws regulating telecommunications services applying these laws and regulations to our business is often unclear subject to change over time and sometimes may conflict from jurisdiction to jurisdiction additionally these laws and governments’ approach to their enforcement and our products and services are continuing to evolve increasing concern about government surveillance practices around the world may lead to increased regulation requiring local data hosting obligations or the use of domestic hosting providers compliance with these types of regulation may involve significant costs or require changes in products or business practices that result in reduced revenue noncompliance could result in the imposition of penalties or orders we stop the alleged noncompliant activity geopolitical instability may lead to sanctions and impact our ability to do business in some geographies 

our business depends on our ability to attract and retain talented employees our business is based on successfully attracting and retaining talented employees the market for highly skilled workers and leaders in our industry is extremely competitive we are limited in our ability to recruit internationally by restrictive domestic immigration laws if we are less successful in our recruiting efforts or if we cannot retain key employees our ability to develop and deliver successful products and services may be adversely affected effective succession planning is also important to our longterm success failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution 

we have claims and lawsuits against us that may result in adverse outcomes we are subject to a variety of claims and lawsuits adverse outcomes in some or all of these claims may result in significant monetary damages or injunctive relief that could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business the litigation and other claims are

subject to inherent uncertainties and management’s view of these matters may change in the future a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements could occur for the period in which the effect of an unfavorable final outcome becomes probable and reasonably estimable 

we may have additional tax liabilities we are subject to income taxes in the us and many foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes in the ordinary course of our business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain we regularly are under audit by tax authorities economic and political pressures to increase tax revenue in various jurisdictions may make resolving tax disputes favorably more difficult although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals the results of an audit or litigation could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements in the period or periods in which that determination is made 

we earn a significant amount of our operating income from outside the us and any repatriation of funds currently held in foreign jurisdictions to the us may result in higher effective tax rates for the company in addition there have been proposals from congress to change us tax laws that would significantly impact how us multinational corporations are taxed on foreign earnings although we cannot predict whether or in what form any proposed legislation may pass if enacted it could have a material adverse impact on our tax expense and cash flows 

our hardware and software products may experience quality or supply problems our verticallyintegrated hardware products such as xbox consoles surface devices phones and other devices we design manufacture and market are highly complex and can have defects in design manufacture or associated software we could incur significant expenses lost revenue and reputational harm if we fail to detect or address such issues through design testing or warranty repairs we acquire some device components from sole suppliers our competitors use some of the same suppliers and their demand for hardware components can affect the capacity available to us if a component from a solesource supplier is delayed or becomes unavailable whether because of supplier capacity constraint or industry shortages we may not obtain timely replacement supplies resulting in reduced sales component shortages excess or obsolete inventory or price reductions resulting in inventory adjustments may increase our cost of revenue xbox consoles surface devices phones and other hardware are assembled in asia and other geographies that may be subject to disruptions in the supply chain resulting in shortages that would affect our revenue and operating margins these same risks would apply to any other verticallyintegrated hardware and software products we may offer 

our software products also may experience quality or reliability problems the highly sophisticated software products we develop may contain bugs and other defects that interfere with their intended operation any defects we do not detect and fix in prerelease testing could cause reduced sales and revenue damage to our reputation repair or remediation costs delays in the release of new products or versions or legal liability although our license agreements typically contain provisions that eliminate or limit our exposure to liability there is no assurance these provisions will withstand legal challenge 

our global business exposes us to operational and economic risks our customers are located in over 200 countries and a significant part of our revenue comes from international sales the global nature of our business creates operational and economic risks emerging markets are a significant focus of our international growth strategy the developing nature of these markets presents several risks including deterioration of social political labor or economic conditions in a country or region and difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations although we hedge a portion of our international currency exposure significant fluctuations in foreign exchange rates between the us dollar and foreign currencies may adversely affect our revenue competitive or regulatory pressure to make our pricing structure uniform might require that we reduce the sales price of our software in the us and other countries 

catastrophic events or geopolitical conditions may disrupt our business a disruption or failure of our systems or operations because of a major earthquake weather event cyberattack terrorist attack or other catastrophic event could cause delays in completing sales providing services or performing other critical functions our corporate headquarters a significant portion of our research and development activities and certain other essential business operations are in the seattle washington area and we have other business operations in the

silicon valley area of california both of which are seismically active regions a catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our critical business or it systems could harm our ability to conduct normal business operations providing our customers with more services and solutions in the cloud puts a premium on the resilience of our systems and strength of our business continuity management plans and magnifies the potential impact of prolonged service outages on our operating results 

abrupt political change terrorist activity and armed conflict pose a risk of general economic disruption in affected countries which may increase our operating costs these conditions also may add uncertainty to the timing and budget for technology investment decisions by our customers and may cause supply chain disruptions for hardware manufacturers either of which may adversely affect our revenue the longterm effects of climate change on the global economy or the it industry in particular are unclear environmental regulations or changes in the supply demand or available sources of energy or other natural resources may affect the availability or cost of goods and services including natural resources necessary to run our business changes in weather where we operate may increase the costs of powering and cooling computer hardware we use to develop software and provide cloudbased services 

adverse economic or market conditions may harm our business worsening economic conditions including inflation recession or other changes in economic conditions may cause lower it spending and adversely affect our revenue if demand for pcs servers and other computing devices declines or consumer or business spending for those products declines our revenue will be adversely affected substantial revenue comes from our us government contracts an extended federal government shutdown resulting from failing to pass budget appropriations adopt continuing funding resolutions or raise the debt ceiling and other budgetary decisions limiting or delaying federal government spending could reduce government it spending on our products and services and adversely affect our revenue 

our product distribution system relies on an extensive partner and retail network oems building devices that run our software have also been a significant means of distribution the impact of economic conditions on our partners such as the bankruptcy of a major distributor oem or retailer could cause sales channel disruption 

challenging economic conditions also may impair the ability of our customers to pay for products and services they have purchased as a result allowances for doubtful accounts and writeoffs of accounts receivable may increase 

we maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings types and maturities these investments are subject to general credit liquidity market and interest rate risks which may be exacerbated by unusual events that affect global financial markets a significant part of our investment portfolio comprises us government securities if global credit and equity markets decline for long periods or if there is a downgrade of the us government credit rating due to an actual or threatened default on government debt our investment portfolio may be adversely affected and we could determine that more of our investments have experienced an otherthantemporary decline in fair value requiring impairment charges that could adversely affect our financial results

 industry trends 

our industry is dynamic and highly competitive with frequent changes in both technologies and business models each industry shift is an opportunity to conceive new products new technologies or new ideas that can further transform the industry and our business at microsoft we push the boundaries of what is possible through a broad range of research and development activities that seek to identify and address the changing demands of customers industry trends and competitive forces 

economic conditions challenges and risks 

the market for software devices and cloudbased services is dynamic and highly competitive our competitors are developing new software and devices while also deploying competing cloudbased services for consumers and businesses the devices and form factors customers prefer evolve rapidly and influence how users access services in the cloud and in some cases the user’s choice of which suite of cloudbased services to use we must continue to evolve and adapt over an extended time in pace with this changing environment the investments we are making in devices and infrastructure will increase our operating costs and may decrease our operating margins 

our success is highly dependent on our ability to attract and retain qualified employees we hire a mix of university and industry talent worldwide microsoft competes for talented individuals globally by offering an exceptional working environment broad customer reach scale in resources the ability to grow one’s career across many different products and businesses and competitive compensation and benefits aggregate demand for our software services and devices is correlated to global macroeconomic and geopolitical factors which remain dynamic 

our international operations provide a significant portion of our total revenue and expenses many of these revenue and expenses are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar as a result changes in foreign exchange rates may significantly affect revenue and expenses recently the significant strengthening of the us dollar relative to certain foreign currencies has negatively impacted reported revenue and reduced reported expenses from our international operations

seasonality 

our revenue historically has fluctuated quarterly and has generally been highest in the second quarter of our fiscal year due to corporate calendar yearend spending trends in our major markets and holiday season spending by consumers our computing and gaming hardware segment is particularly seasonal as its products are aimed at the consumer market and are in highest demand during the holiday shopping season typically the computing and gaming hardware segment has generated approximately 4050 of its yearly revenue in our second fiscal quarter 

unearned revenue 

quarterly and annual revenue may be impacted by the deferral of revenue including 

 

  

  

 if our customers choose to license cloudbased versions of our products and services rather than licensing transactionbased products and services the associated revenue will shift from being recognized at the time of the transaction to being recognized over the subscription period or upon consumption as applicable

other income expense net 

the components of other income expense net were as follows 

 

 we use derivative instruments to manage risks related to foreign currencies equity prices interest rates and credit enhance investment returns and facilitate portfolio diversification gains and losses from changes in fair values of derivatives that are not designated as hedges are primarily recognized in other income expense net other than those derivatives entered into for investment purposes such as commodity contracts the gains losses are generally economically offset by unrealized gains losses in the underlying availableforsale securities and gains losses on certain balance sheet amounts from foreign exchange rate changes 

fiscal year 2015 compared with fiscal year 2014 

dividends and interest income decreased due to lower yields on fixed income securities offset in part by higher portfolio balances interest expense increased due to higher outstanding longterm debt net recognized gains on investments increased primarily due to higher gains on sales of equity securities offset in part by higher otherthantemporary impairments otherthantemporary impairments were 183 million in fiscal year 2015 compared with 106 million in fiscal year 2014 net losses on derivatives increased due to losses on commodity contracts in the current period as compared to gains in the prior period offset in part by lower losses on currency and equity contracts for fiscal year 2015 other reflects recognized losses from certain joint ventures and divestitures 

fiscal year 2014 compared with fiscal year 2013 

dividends and interest income increased due to higher portfolio balances interest expense increased due to higher outstanding longterm debt net recognized gains on investments increased primarily due to higher gains on sales of equity securities and lower otherthantemporary impairments otherthantemporary impairments were 106 million in fiscal year 2014 compared with 208 million in fiscal year 2013 net losses on derivatives increased due to higher losses on foreign exchange contracts losses on equity derivatives as compared to gains in the prior period offset in part by gains on commodity and interest rate derivatives as compared to losses in the prior period for fiscal year 2014 other reflects recognized losses from certain joint ventures offset in part by a recognized gain on a divestiture for fiscal year 2013 other reflects recognized gains on divestitures including the gain recognized upon the divestiture of our 50 share in the msnbc joint venture 

income taxes 

fiscal year 2015 compared with fiscal year 2014 

our effective tax rate for fiscal years 2015 and 2014 was approximately 34 and 21 respectively the fiscal year 2015 effective rate increased by 13 primarily due to goodwill and asset impairments and restructuring charges recorded in fiscal year 2015 most of which did not generate a tax benefit our effective tax rate was lower than the us federal statutory rate primarily due to foreign earnings taxed at lower rates resulting from producing and distributing our products and services through our foreign regional operations centers in ireland singapore and puerto rico in fiscal year 2015 this reduction was mostly offset by losses in foreign jurisdictions for which we may not realize a tax benefit primarily as a result of impairment and restructuring charges

changes in the mix of income before income taxes between the us and foreign countries also impacted our effective tax rates and resulted primarily from changes in the geographic distribution of and changes in consumer demand for our products and services we supply our windows pc operating system to customers through our us regional operating center while we supply the microsoft office system and our server products and tools to customers through our foreign regional operations centers in fiscal years 2015 and 2014 our us income before income taxes was 74 billion and 71 billion respectively and comprised 40 and 26 respectively of our income before income taxes in fiscal years 2015 and 2014 our foreign income before income taxes was 111 billion and 207 billion respectively and comprised 60 and 74 respectively of our income before income taxes 

tax contingencies and other income tax liabilities were 121 billion and 104 billion as of june 30 2015 and 2014 respectively and are included in other longterm liabilities this increase relates primarily to adjustments to prior years’ liabilities for intercompany transfer pricing and adjustments related to our irs audits while we settled a portion of the irs audit for tax years 2004 to 2006 during the third quarter of fiscal year 2011 we remain under audit for those years in february 2012 the irs withdrew its 2011 revenue agents report and reopened the audit phase of the examination as of june 30 2015 the primary unresolved issue relates to transfer pricing which could have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements if not resolved favorably we believe our allowances for income tax contingencies are adequate we have not received a proposed assessment for the unresolved issues and do not expect a final resolution of these issues in the next 12 months based on the information currently available we do not anticipate a significant increase or decrease to our tax contingencies for these issues within the next 12 months we also continue to be subject to examination by the irs for tax years 2007 to 2015 

we are subject to income tax in many jurisdictions outside the us our operations in certain jurisdictions remain subject to examination for tax years 1996 to 2015 some of which are currently under audit by local tax authorities the resolutions of these audits are not expected to be material to our consolidated financial statements 

fiscal year 2014 compared with fiscal year 2013 

our effective tax rate for fiscal years 2014 and 2013 was approximately 21 and 19 respectively our effective tax rate was lower than the us federal statutory rate primarily due to earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting from producing and distributing our products and services through our foreign regional operations centers in ireland singapore and puerto rico 

our fiscal year 2014 effective rate increased by 2 from fiscal year 2013 mainly due to adjustments of 458 million to prior years’ liabilities for intercompany transfer pricing that increased taxable income in more highly taxed jurisdictions as well as losses incurred by nds and changes in the geographic mix of our business this was offset in part by favorable transfer pricing developments in certain foreign tax jurisdictions primarily denmark 

changes in the mix of income before income taxes between the us and foreign countries also impacted our effective tax rates and resulted primarily from changes in the geographic distribution of and changes in consumer demand for our products and services we supply our windows pc operating system to customers through our us regional operating center while we supply the microsoft office system and our server products and tools to customers through our foreign regional operations centers windows pc operating system revenue decreased 655 million in fiscal year 2014 while microsoft office system and server products and tools revenue increased 13 billion and 16 billion respectively during this same period in fiscal years 2014 and 2013 our us income before income taxes was 71 billion and 67 billion respectively and comprised 26 and 25 respectively of our income before income taxes in fiscal years 2014 and 2013 the foreign income before income taxes was 207 billion and 204 billion respectively and comprised 74 and 75 respectively of our income before income taxes 

financial condition

preservation they consist predominantly of highly liquid investmentgrade fixedincome securities diversified among industries and individual issuers the investments are predominantly us dollardenominated securities but also include foreign currencydenominated securities in order to diversify risk our fixedincome investments are exposed to interest rate risk and credit risk the credit risk and average maturity of our fixedincome portfolio are managed to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain fixedincome indices the settlement risk related to these investments is insignificant given that the shortterm investments held are primarily highly liquid investmentgrade fixedincome securities 

of the cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments at june 30 2015 944 billion was held by our foreign subsidiaries and would be subject to material repatriation tax effects the amount of cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments held by foreign subsidiaries subject to other restrictions on the free flow of funds primarily currency and other local regulatory was 21 billion as of june 30 2015 approximately 79 of the cash equivalents and shortterm investments held by our foreign subsidiaries were invested in us government and agency securities approximately 5 were invested in corporate notes and bonds of us companies and approximately 5 were invested in us mortgage and assetbacked securities all of which are denominated in us dollars 

securities lending 

we lend certain fixedincome and equity securities to increase investment returns the loaned securities continue to be carried as investments on our balance sheet cash andor security interests are received as collateral for the loaned securities with the amount determined based upon the underlying security lent and the creditworthiness of the borrower cash received is recorded as an asset with a corresponding liability our securities lending payable balance was 92 million as of june 30 2015 our average and maximum securities lending payable balances for the fiscal year were 287 million and 750 million respectively intrayear variances in the amount of securities loaned are mainly due to fluctuations in the demand for the securities 

valuation 

in general and where applicable we use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities to determine the fair value of our financial instruments this pricing methodology applies to our level 1 investments such as exchangetraded mutual funds domestic and international equities and us government securities if quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities are not available to determine fair value then we use quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities or inputs other than the quoted prices that are observable either directly or indirectly this pricing methodology applies to our level 2 investments such as corporate notes and bonds common and preferred stock foreign government bonds mortgage and assetbacked securities us government and agency securities and certificates of deposit level 3 investments are valued using internally developed models with unobservable inputs assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis using unobservable inputs are an immaterial portion of our portfolio 

a majority of our investments are priced by pricing vendors and are generally level 1 or level 2 investments as these vendors either provide a quoted market price in an active market or use observable inputs for their pricing without applying significant adjustments broker pricing is used mainly when a quoted price is not available the investment is not priced by our pricing vendors or when a broker price is more reflective of fair values in the market in which the investment trades our brokerpriced investments are generally classified as level 2 investments because the broker prices these investments based on similar assets without applying significant adjustments in addition all of our brokerpriced investments have a sufficient level of trading volume to demonstrate that the fair values used are appropriate for these investments our fair value processes include controls that are designed to ensure appropriate fair values are recorded these controls include model validation review of key model inputs analysis of periodoverperiod fluctuations and independent recalculation of prices where appropriate

cash flows 

fiscal year 2015 compared with fiscal year 2014 

cash flows from operations decreased 32 billion during the fiscal year to 291 billion mainly due to an increase in materials and production costs in support of sales growth as well as payments related to restructuring charges and other changes in working capital offset in part by increases in cash received from customers cash used in financing increased 686 million to 91 billion mainly due to a 71 billion increase in cash used for common stock repurchases offset in part by a 67 billion increase in proceeds from issuances of debt net of repayments cash used in investing increased 42 billion to 230 billion mainly due to a 55 billion increase in cash used for net investment purchases sales and maturities partially offset by a 22 billion decrease in cash used for acquisitions of companies and purchases of intangible and other assets 

fiscal year 2014 compared with fiscal year 2013 

cash flows from operations increased 34 billion during fiscal year 2014 to 322 billion mainly due to increases in cash received from customers cash used in financing increased 246 million to 84 billion mainly due to a 20 billion increase in cash used for common stock repurchases a 14 billion increase in dividends paid and a 324 million decrease in proceeds from the issuance of common stock offset in part by a 34 billion increase in proceeds from issuances of debt net of repayments cash used in investing decreased 50 billion to 188 billion mainly due to a 105 billion decrease in cash used for net investment purchases sales and maturities offset in part by a 44 billion increase in cash used for acquisition of companies and purchases of intangible and other assets and a 12 billion increase in capital expenditures for property and equipment 

debt 

we issued debt to take advantage of favorable pricing and liquidity in the debt markets reflecting our credit rating and the low interest rate environment the proceeds of these issuances were or will be used for general corporate purposes which may include among other things funding for working capital capital expenditures repurchases of capital stock acquisitions and repayment of existing debt see note 12 – debt of the notes to financial statements part ii item 8 of this form 10k for further discussion 

unearned revenue 

unearned revenue at june 30 2015 was comprised mainly of unearned revenue from volume licensing programs unearned revenue from volume licensing programs represents customer billings for multiyear licensing arrangements paid for either at inception of the agreement or annually at the beginning of each coverage period and accounted for as subscriptions with revenue recognized ratably over the coverage period unearned revenue at june 30 2015 also included payments for postdelivery support and consulting services to be performed in the future xbox live subscriptions and prepaid points microsoft dynamics business solutions products office 365 subscriptions skype prepaid credits and subscriptions bundled offerings and other offerings for which we have been paid in advance and earn the revenue when we provide the service or software or otherwise meet the revenue recognition criteria

share repurchases 

on september 16 2013 our board of directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing up to 400 billion in share repurchases the share repurchase program became effective on october 1 2013 has no expiration date and may be suspended or discontinued at any time without notice while the program has no expiration date we intend to complete it by december 31 2016 as of june 30 2015 219 billion remained of our 400 billion share repurchase program 

during fiscal year 2015 we repurchased 295 million shares of microsoft common stock for 132 billion under the share repurchase program approved by our board of directors on september 16 2013 during fiscal year 2014 we repurchased 175 million shares for 64 billion 128 million shares were repurchased for 49 billion under the share repurchase program approved by our board of directors on september 16 2013 and 47 million shares were repurchased for 15 billion under the share repurchase program that was announced on september 22 2008 and expired september 30 2013 during fiscal year 2013 we repurchased 158 million shares for 46 billion under the share repurchase program announced on september 22 2008 all repurchases were made using cash resources

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we provide indemnifications of varying scope and size to certain customers against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products and certain other matters in evaluating estimated losses on these indemnifications we consider factors such as the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and our ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss these obligations did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements during the periods presented

other planned uses of capital 

we will continue to invest in sales marketing product support infrastructure and existing and advanced areas of technology as well as continue making acquisitions that align with our business strategy additions to property and equipment will continue including new facilities data centers and computer systems for research and development sales and marketing support and administrative staff we expect capital expenditures to increase in coming years in support of our productivity and platform strategy we have operating leases for most us and international sales and support offices and certain equipment we have not engaged in any related party transactions or arrangements with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect liquidity or the availability of capital resources 

liquidity 

we earn a significant amount of our operating income outside the us which is deemed to be permanently reinvested in foreign jurisdictions as a result as discussed above under cash cash equivalents and investments the majority of our cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments are held by foreign subsidiaries we currently do not intend nor foresee a need to repatriate these funds we expect existing domestic cash cash equivalents shortterm investments cash flows from operations and access to capital markets to continue to be sufficient to fund our domestic operating activities and cash commitments for investing and financing activities such as regular quarterly dividends debt maturities and material capital expenditures for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future in addition we expect existing foreign cash cash equivalents shortterm investments and cash flows from operations to continue to be sufficient to fund our foreign operating activities and cash commitments for investing activities such as material capital expenditures for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future 

should we require more capital in the us than is generated by our operations domestically for example to fund significant discretionary activities such as business acquisitions and share repurchases we could elect to repatriate future earnings from foreign jurisdictions or raise capital in the us through debt or equity issuances these alternatives could result in higher effective tax rates increased interest expense or dilution of our earnings we have borrowed funds domestically and continue to believe we have the ability to do so at reasonable interest rates 

recent accounting guidance 

see note 1 – accounting policies of the notes to financial statements part ii item 8 of this form 10k for further discussion 

application of critical accounting policies 

our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with us gaap preparing consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses these estimates and assumptions are affected by management’s application of accounting policies critical accounting policies for us include revenue recognition impairment of investment securities goodwill research and development costs contingencies income taxes and inventories 

revenue recognition 

revenue recognition for multipleelement arrangements requires judgment to determine if multiple elements exist whether elements can be accounted for as separate units of accounting and if so the fair value for each of the elements 

judgment is also required to assess whether future releases of certain software represent new products or upgrades and enhancements to existing products certain volume licensing arrangements include a perpetual license for current products combined with rights to receive unspecified future versions of software products and are accounted for as subscriptions with billings recorded as unearned revenue and recognized as revenue ratably over the coverage period 

  

  

part ii 

item 7 

  

software updates are evaluated on a casebycase basis to determine whether they meet the definition of an upgrade which may require revenue to be deferred and recognized when the upgrade is delivered if it is determined that implied postcontract customer support “pcs” is being provided revenue from the arrangement is deferred and recognized over the implied pcs term if updates are determined to not meet the definition of an upgrade revenue is generally recognized as products are shipped or made available 

microsoft enters into arrangements that can include various combinations of software services and hardware where elements are delivered over different periods of time and when allowed under us gaap revenue is allocated to the respective elements based on their relative selling prices at the inception of the arrangement and revenue is recognized as each element is delivered we use a hierarchy to determine the fair value to be used for allocating revenue to elements i vendorspecific objective evidence of fair value “vsoe” ii thirdparty evidence and iii best estimate of selling price “esp” for software elements we follow the industry specific software guidance which only allows for the use of vsoe in establishing fair value generally vsoe is the price charged when the deliverable is sold separately or the price established by management for a product that is not yet sold if it is probable that the price will not change before introduction into the marketplace esps are established as best estimates of what the selling prices would be if the deliverables were sold regularly on a standalone basis our process for determining esps requires judgment and considers multiple factors that may vary over time depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each deliverable 

in january 2015 we announced windows 10 will be free to all qualified existing users of windows 7 and windows 81 this offer differs from historical offers preceding the launch of new versions of windows as it is being made available for free to existing users in addition to new customers after the offer announcement we evaluated the nature and accounting treatment of the windows 10 offer and determined that it represents a marketing and promotional activity in part because the offer is being made available for free to existing users as this is a marketing and promotional activity revenue recognition of new sales of windows 8 will continue to be recognized as delivered 

impairment of investment securities 

we review investments quarterly for indicators of otherthantemporary impairment this determination requires significant judgment in making this judgment we employ a systematic methodology quarterly that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments if the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value we evaluate among other factors general market conditions credit quality of debt instrument issuers the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost and for equity securities our intent and ability to hold or plans to sell the investment for fixedincome securities we also evaluate whether we have plans to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery we also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the investee including industry and sector performance changes in technology and operational and financing cash flow factors once a decline in fair value is determined to be otherthantemporary an impairment charge is recorded to other income expense net and a new cost basis in the investment is established if market industry andor investee conditions deteriorate we may incur future impairments 

goodwill 

we allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the business combination we evaluate our reporting units on an annual basis and if necessary reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level operating segment or one level below an operating segment on an annual basis may 1 for us and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value these events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate legal factors operating performance indicators competition or sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit 

application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment including the identification of reporting units assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units assignment of goodwill to reporting units and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit the fair value of each reporting unit is estimated primarily through the use of a 

  

  

part ii 

item 7 

  

discounted cash flow methodology this analysis requires significant judgments including estimation of future cash flows which is dependent on internal forecasts estimation of the longterm rate of growth for our business estimation of the useful life over which cash flows will occur and determination of our weighted average cost of capital 

the estimates used to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit change from year to year based on operating results market conditions and other factors changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and goodwill impairment for each reporting unit 

based on the results of our annual goodwill impairment testing as of may 1 2015 we determined that goodwill associated with our phone hardware reporting unit was impaired resulting in a material charge to earnings in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015 as of june 30 2015 none of our reporting units were considered to be at risk of impairment 

research and development costs 

costs incurred internally in researching and developing a computer software product are charged to expense until technological feasibility has been established for the product once technological feasibility is established all software costs are capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers judgment is required in determining when technological feasibility of a product is established we have determined that technological feasibility for our software products is reached after all highrisk development issues have been resolved through coding and testing generally this occurs shortly before the products are released to manufacturing the amortization of these costs is included in cost of revenue over the estimated life of the products 

legal and other contingencies 

the outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought against us are subject to significant uncertainty an estimated loss from a loss contingency such as a legal proceeding or claim is accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated in determining whether a loss should be accrued we evaluate among other factors the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss changes in these factors could materially impact our consolidated financial statements 

income taxes 

the objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity’s financial statements or tax returns we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement accounting literature also provides guidance on derecognition of income tax assets and liabilities classification of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities accounting for interest and penalties associated with tax positions and income tax disclosures judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our consolidated financial statements

risks 

we are exposed to economic risk from foreign exchange rates interest rates credit risk equity prices and commodity prices a portion of these risks is hedged but they may impact our consolidated financial statements 

foreign currency 

certain forecasted transactions assets and liabilities are exposed to foreign currency risk we monitor our foreign currency exposures daily and use hedges where practicable to offset the risks and maximize the economic effectiveness of our foreign currency positions principal currencies hedged include the euro japanese yen british pound canadian dollar and australian dollar 

interest rate 

our fixedincome portfolio is diversified across credit sectors and maturities consisting primarily of investmentgrade securities the credit risk and average maturity of the fixedincome portfolio is managed to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain global and domestic fixedincome indices in addition we use “to be announced” forward purchase commitments of mortgagebacked assets to gain exposure to agency mortgagebacked securities 

equity 

our equity portfolio consists of global developed and emerging market securities that are subject to market price risk we manage the securities relative to certain global and domestic indices and expect their economic risk and return to correlate with these indices 

commodity 

we use broadbased commodity exposures to enhance portfolio returns and facilitate portfolio diversification our investment portfolio has exposure to a variety of commodities including precious metals energy and grain we manage these exposures relative to global commodity indices and expect their economic risk and return to correlate with these indices 

valueatrisk 

we use a valueatrisk “var” model to estimate and quantify our market risks var is the expected loss for a given confidence level in the fair value of our portfolio due to adverse market movements over a defined time horizon the var model is not intended to represent actual losses in fair value including determinations of otherthantemporary losses in fair value in accordance with us gaap but is used as a risk estimation and management tool the distribution of the potential changes in total market value of all holdings is computed based on the historical volatilities and correlations among foreign exchange rates interest rates equity prices and commodity prices assuming normal market conditions 

the var is calculated as the total loss that will not be exceeded at the 975 percentile confidence level or alternatively stated the losses could exceed the var in 25 out of 1000 cases several risk factors are not captured in the model including liquidity risk operational risk and legal risk

the following table sets forth the oneday var for substantially all of our positions as of june 30 2015 and 2014 and for the year ended june 30 2015 

 

 total oneday var for the combined risk categories was 237 million at june 30 2015 and 333 million at june 30 2014 the total var is 29 less at june 30 2015 and 25 less at june 30 2014 than the sum of the separate risk categories in the table above due to the diversification benefit of the combination of risks

windows embedded extends the power of windows and the cloud to intelligent systems including the internet of things by delivering specialized operating systems tools and services

the versions of office in commercial licensing are designed to increase personal team and organizational productivity through a range of programs services and software solutions office commercial revenue is mainly affected by a combination of the demand from commercial customers for volume licensing and software assurance and the number of information workers in a licensed enterprise and is therefore relatively independent of the number of pcs sold in a given year

research and development 

during fiscal years 2014 2013 and 2012 research and development expense was 114 billion 104 billion and 98 billion respectively these amounts represented 13 of revenue in each of those years we plan to continue to make significant investments in a broad range of research and development efforts 

product and service development and intellectual property 

we develop most of our products and services internally through four primary engineering groups 

 

  

  

  

 internal development allows us to maintain competitive advantages that come from product differentiation and closer technical control over our products and services it also gives us the freedom to decide which modifications and enhancements are most important and when they should be implemented we strive to obtain information as early as possible about changing usage patterns and hardware advances that may affect software design before releasing new software platforms we provide application vendors with a range of resources and guidelines for development training and testing generally we also create product documentation internally 

we protect our intellectual property investments in a variety of ways we work actively in the us and internationally to ensure the enforcement of copyright trademark trade secret and other protections that apply to our software and hardware products services business plans and branding we are a leader among technology companies in pursuing patents and currently have a portfolio of over 55000 us and international patents issued and over 40000 pending while we employ much of our internally developed intellectual property exclusively in microsoft products and services we also engage in outbound and inbound licensing of specific patented technologies that are incorporated into licensees’ or microsoft’s products from time to time we enter into broader crosslicense agreements with other technology companies covering entire groups of patents we also purchase or license technology that we incorporate into our products or services at times we make select intellectual property broadly available at no or low cost to achieve a strategic objective such as promoting industry standards advancing interoperability or attracting and enabling our external development community in conjunction with the nds acquisition we received an initial 10year nonexclusive license to certain nokia patents we also agreed to license nokia’s mapping services and granted nokia reciprocal rights to use our patents for their mapping and location services 

while it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of our products and business methods we believe based upon past experience and industry practice such licenses generally could be obtained on commercially reasonable terms we believe our continuing research and product development are not materially dependent on any single license or other agreement with a third party relating to the development of our products 

investing in the future 

microsoft’s success is based on our ability to create new and compelling products services and experiences for our users to initiate and embrace disruptive technology trends to enter new geographic and product markets and to drive broad adoption of our products and services we invest in a range of emerging technology trends and

 item 1a risk factors 

our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties including those described below that could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations cash flows and the trading price of our common stock 

we face intense competition across all markets for our products and services which may lead to lower revenue or operating margins 

competition in the technology sector 

our competitors range in size from diversified global companies with significant research and development resources to small specialized firms whose narrower product lines may let them be more effective in deploying technical marketing and financial resources barriers to entry in our businesses are low and software products can

item 1a 

  

be distributed broadly and quickly at relatively low cost many of the areas in which we compete evolve rapidly with changing and disruptive technologies shifting user needs and frequent introductions of new products and services our ability to remain competitive depends on our success in making innovative products devices and services that appeal to businesses and consumers 

competition among platforms ecosystems and devices 

an important element of our business model has been to create platformbased ecosystems on which many participants can build diverse solutions a wellestablished ecosystem creates beneficial network effects among users application developers and the platform provider that can accelerate growth establishing significant scale in the marketplace is necessary to achieve and maintain attractive margins the strategic importance of developing and maintaining a vibrant ecosystem increased with the launch of the windows 8 operating system surface windows phone xbox one and associated cloudbased services we face significant competition from firms that provide competing platforms applications and services 

 

  

  

  

 business model competition 

companies compete with us based on a growing variety of business models 

 

   

  

part i 

item 1a 

  

  

 the competitive pressures described above may cause decreased sales volumes price reductions andor increased operating costs such as for research and development marketing and sales incentives this may lead to lower revenue gross margins and operating income 

our increasing focus on services presents execution and competitive risks a growing part of our business involves cloudbased services available across the spectrum of computing devices in july 2014 our leadership announced its strategic vision to compete and grow as a productivity and platform company for the mobilefirst and cloudfirst world at the same time our competitors are rapidly developing and deploying cloudbased services for consumers and business customers pricing and delivery models are evolving devices and form factors influence how users access services in the cloud and sometimes the user’s choice of which suite of cloudbased services to use we are devoting significant resources to develop and deploy our cloudbased strategies the windows ecosystem must continue to evolve with this changing environment we are embracing cultural and organizational changes to drive accountability and eliminate obstacles to innovation besides software development costs we are incurring costs to build and maintain infrastructure to support cloud computing services these costs will reduce the operating margins we have previously achieved whether we succeed in cloudbased services depends on our execution in several areas including 

 

  

  

  

  

 it is uncertain whether our strategies will attract the users or generate the revenue required to succeed if we are not effective in executing organizational changes to increase efficiency and accelerate innovation or if we fail to generate sufficient usage of our new products and services we may not grow revenues in line with the infrastructure and development investments described above this may negatively impact gross margins and operating income 

we make significant investments in new products and services that may not be profitable we will continue to make significant investments in research development and marketing for existing products services and technologies including the windows operating system the microsoft office system bing windows phone windows server the windows store the microsoft azure services platform office 365 other cloudbased services offerings and the xbox entertainment platform we also invest in the development and acquisition of a variety of hardware for productivity communication and entertainment including pcs tablets phones and gaming devices investments in new technology are speculative commercial success depends on many factors including innovativeness developer support and effective distribution and marketing if customers do not perceive our latest offerings as providing significant new functionality or other value they may reduce their purchases of new software and hardware products or upgrades unfavorably affecting revenue we may not achieve significant revenue from new product service and 

  

  

part i 

item 1a 

  

distribution channel investments for several years if at all new products and services may not be profitable and even if they are profitable operating margins for some new products and businesses will not be as high as the margins we have experienced historically 

developing new technologies is complex and timeconsuming it can require long development and testing periods significant delays in new releases or significant problems in creating new products or services could adversely affect our revenue 

acquisitions joint ventures and strategic alliances may have an adverse effect on our business we expect to continue making acquisitions or entering into joint ventures and strategic alliances as part of our longterm business strategy these transactions involve significant challenges and risks including that the transaction does not advance our business strategy that we get no satisfactory return on our investment that we have difficulty integrating new employees business systems and technology or that the transaction distracts management from our other businesses the success of these transactions will depend in part on our ability to leverage them enhance our existing products and services or develop compelling new ones it may take longer than expected to realize the full benefits from these transactions such as increased revenue enhanced efficiencies or increased market share or the benefits may ultimately be smaller than we expected these events could adversely affect our operating results or financial condition 

in april 2014 we acquired from nokia substantially all of its nds business to accelerate our growth in phones and support the entire windows ecosystem we may not realize all of the anticipated financial and other benefits from this transaction including operating efficiencies and cost savings we may not be successful in developing a vibrant and competitive ecosystem for windowsbased phones that combines differentiated hardware software services and thirdparty applications we may not achieve mobile phone market share targets we may see lower than expected growth rates for the phone markets the mix of premium and lowercost devices we sell may put downward pressure on prices or margins we may not be effective in executing the restructuring we announced in july 2014 or otherwise integrating the nds business with microsoft’s ongoing operations including matching manufacturing capacity to demand existing microsoft smart device original equipment manufacturers may respond negatively to the changes in our business or the new competitive environment 

if our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets become impaired we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings we acquire other companies and intangible assets and may not realize all the economic benefit from those acquisitions which could cause an impairment of goodwill or intangibles we review our amortizable intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable we test goodwill for impairment at least annually factors that may be a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets may not be recoverable include a decline in our stock price and market capitalization reduced future cash flow estimates and slower growth rates in industry segments in which we participate we may be required to record a significant charge in our consolidated financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets is determined negatively affecting our results of operations for example in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2012 we recorded a 62 billion charge for the impairment of goodwill in our previous online services division business devices and consumer other under our current segment structure 

the valuation of acquired assets and liabilities including goodwill resulting from the acquisition of nds is reflective of the enterprise value based on the longterm financial forecast for the business in this highly competitive and volatile market we may not realize our forecasts as a result we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings in our consolidated financial statements due to an impairment of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets 

we may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property rights protecting our global intellectual property rights and combating unlicensed copying and use of our software and other intellectual property is difficult while piracy adversely affects us revenue the impact on revenue from outside the us is more significant particularly in countries where laws are less protective of intellectual property rights our revenue in these markets may grow slower than the underlying device market similarly the absence of harmonized patent laws makes it more difficult to ensure consistent respect for patent rights throughout the world we educate consumers about the 

  

  

part i 

item 1a 

  

benefits of licensing genuine products and obtaining indemnification benefits for intellectual property risks and we educate lawmakers about the advantages of a business climate where intellectual property rights are protected reductions in the legal protection for software intellectual property rights could adversely affect revenue 

third parties may claim we infringe their intellectual property rights from time to time others claim we infringe their intellectual property rights the number of these claims may grow because of constant technological change in the markets in which we compete the extensive patent coverage of existing technologies the rapid rate of issuance of new patents and our offering of firstparty devices such as surface and lumia phones to resolve these claims we may enter into royalty and licensing agreements on terms that are less favorable than currently available stop selling or redesign affected products or services or pay damages to satisfy indemnification commitments with our customers these outcomes may cause operating margins to decline besides money damages in some jurisdictions plaintiffs can seek injunctive relief that may limit or prevent importing marketing and selling our products or services that have infringing technologies in some countries such as germany an injunction can be issued before the parties have fully litigated the validity of the underlying patents we have paid significant amounts to settle claims related to the use of technology and intellectual property rights and to procure intellectual property rights as part of our strategy to manage this risk and may continue to do so 

we may not be able to protect our source code from copying if there is an unauthorized disclosure of source code source code the detailed program commands for our operating systems and other software programs is critical to our business although we license portions of our application and operating system source code to several licensees we take significant measures to protect the secrecy of large portions of our source code if a significant portion of our source code leaks we might lose future trade secret protection for that source code it may become easier for third parties to compete with our products by copying functionality which could adversely affect our revenue and operating margins unauthorized disclosure of source code also could increase the security risks described in the next paragraph 

cyberattacks and security vulnerabilities could lead to reduced revenue increased costs liability claims or harm to our competitive position 

security of microsoft’s information technology 

threats to information technology “it” security can take a variety of forms individual and groups of hackers and sophisticated organizations including statesponsored organizations may take steps that pose threats to our customers and our it they may develop and deploy malicious software to attack our products and services and gain access to our networks and datacenters or act in a coordinated manner to launch distributed denial of service or other coordinated attacks cyber threats are constantly evolving thereby increasing the difficulty of detecting and successfully defending against them cyber threats can have cascading impacts that unfold with increasing speed across our internal networks and systems and those of our partners and customers breaches of our network or data security could disrupt the security of our internal systems and business applications impair our ability to provide services to our customers and protect the privacy of their data result in product development delays compromise confidential or technical business information harming our competitive position result in theft or misuse of our intellectual property or other assets require us to allocate more resources to improved technologies or otherwise adversely affect our business 

in addition our internal it environment continues to evolve often we are early adopters of new devices and technologies we embrace new ways of sharing data and communicating internally and with partners and customers using methods such as social networking and other consumeroriented technologies our business policies and internal security controls may not keep pace with the speed of these changes as new threats emerge 

security of our product services devices and customers’ data 

security threats are a particular challenge to companies like us whose business is technology products and services threats to our own it infrastructure can also affect our customers customers using our cloudbased services rely on the security of our infrastructure to ensure the reliability of our services and the protection of their data hackers 

  

  

part i 

item 1a 

  

tend to focus their efforts on the most popular operating systems programs and services including many of ours and we expect that to continue the security of our products and services is important in our customers’ purchasing decisions 

to defend against security threats both to our internal it systems and those of our customers we must continuously engineer more secure products and services enhance security and reliability features improve the deployment of software updates to address security vulnerabilities develop mitigation technologies that help to secure customers from attacks even when software updates are not deployed maintain the digital security infrastructure that protects the integrity of our network products and services and provide customers security tools such as firewalls and antivirus software 

the cost of these steps could reduce our operating margins if we fail to do these things well actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products and services could harm our reputation and lead customers to reduce or delay future purchases of products or subscriptions to services or to use competing products or services customers may also spend more on protecting their existing computer systems from attack which could delay adoption of additional products or services customers may fail to update their systems continue to run software or operating systems we no longer support or may fail timely to install security patches any of these actions by customers could adversely affect our revenue actual or perceived vulnerabilities may lead to claims against us although our license agreements typically contain provisions that eliminate or limit our exposure to liability there is no assurance these provisions will withstand legal challenges legislative or regulatory action in these areas may increase the costs to develop implement or secure our products and services 

disclosure of personal data could cause liability and harm our reputation as we continue to grow the number and scale of our cloudbased offerings we store and process increasingly large amounts of personally identifiable information of our customers the continued occurrence of highprofile data breaches provides evidence of an external environment increasingly hostile to information security despite our efforts to improve the security controls across our business groups and geographies it is possible our security controls over personal data our training of employees and vendors on data security and other practices we follow may not prevent the improper disclosure of customer data we or our vendors store and manage improper disclosure could harm our reputation lead to legal exposure to customers or subject us to liability under laws that protect personal data resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue our software products and services also enable our customers to store and process personal data onpremises or increasingly in a cloudbased environment we host like all providers of communications services government authorities can sometimes require us to produce customer data in response to valid legal orders in the us and elsewhere we advocate for transparency concerning these requests and appropriate limitations on government authority to compel disclosure despite our efforts to protect customer data perceptions that the privacy of personal information is not satisfactorily protected could inhibit sales of our products or services and could limit adoption of our cloudbased solutions by consumers businesses and government entities additional security measures we may take to address customer concerns or constraints on our flexibility to determine where and how to operate datacenters in response to customer expectations or governmental rules or actions may cause higher operating expenses 

we may have outages data losses and disruptions of our online services if we fail to maintain an adequate operations infrastructure our increasing user traffic growth in services and the complexity of our products and services demand more computing power we spend substantial amounts to build purchase or lease datacenters and equipment and to upgrade our technology and network infrastructure to handle more traffic on our websites and in our datacenters these demands continue to increase as we introduce new products and services and support the growth of existing services such as bing exchange online office 365 sharepoint online onedrive skype xbox live microsoft azure outlookcom microsoft office web apps windows stores and microsoft account services we are rapidly growing our business of providing a platform and backend hosting for services provided by thirdparties to their end users maintaining securing and expanding this infrastructure is expensive and complex inefficiencies or operational failures including temporary or permanent loss of customer data could diminish the quality of our products services and user experience resulting in contractual liability claims by customers and other third parties damage to our reputation and loss of current and potential users subscribers and advertisers each of which may harm our operating results and financial condition

government litigation and regulatory activity relating to competition rules may limit how we design and market our products as a leading global software and device maker we are closely scrutinized by government agencies under us and foreign competition laws an increasing number of governments are regulating competition law activities and this includes increased scrutiny in potentially large markets such as china some jurisdictions also allow competitors or consumers to assert claims of anticompetitive conduct us federal and state antitrust authorities have previously brought enforcement actions and continue to scrutinize our business 

the european commission closely scrutinizes the design of highvolume microsoft products and the terms on which we make certain technologies used in these products such as file formats programming interfaces and protocols available to other companies in 2004 the commission ordered us to create new versions of windows that do not include certain multimedia technologies and to provide our competitors with specifications for how to implement certain proprietary windows communications protocols in their own products in 2009 the commission accepted a set of commitments offered by microsoft to address the commission’s concerns relating to competition in web browsing software including an undertaking to address commission concerns relating to interoperability these obligations may limit our ability to innovate in windows or other products in the future diminish the developer appeal of the windows platform and increase our product development costs the availability of licenses related to protocols and file formats may enable competitors to develop software products that better mimic the functionality of our products which could hamper sales of our products 

our portfolio of firstparty devices continues to grow at the same time our oem partners offer a large variety of devices on our platforms as a result increasingly we both cooperate and compete with our oem partners creating a risk that we fail to do so in compliance with competition rules regulatory scrutiny in this area may increase certain foreign governments particularly in china and other countries in asia have advanced arguments under their competition laws that exert downward pressure on royalties for our intellectual property because these jurisdictions only recently implemented competition laws their enforcement activities are unpredictable 

government regulatory actions and court decisions such as these may hinder our ability to provide the benefits of our software to consumers and businesses reducing the attractiveness of our products and the revenue that come from them new competition law actions could be initiated the outcome of such actions or steps taken to avoid them could adversely affect us in a variety of ways including 

 

  

  

  

 our international operations subject us to potential liability under anticorruption trade protection and other laws and regulations the foreign corrupt practices act and other anticorruption laws and regulations “anticorruption laws” prohibit corrupt payments by our employees vendors or agents from time to time we receive inquiries from authorities in the us and elsewhere about our business activities outside the us and our compliance with anticorruption laws while we devote substantial resources to our global compliance programs and have implemented policies training and internal controls designed to reduce the risk of corrupt payments our employees vendors or agents may violate our policies our failure to comply with anticorruption laws could result in significant fines and penalties criminal sanctions against us our officers or our employees prohibitions on the conduct of our business and damage to our reputation operations outside the us may be affected by changes in trade protection laws policies and measures and other regulatory requirements affecting trade and investment we may be subject to legal liability and reputational damage if we sell goods or services in violation of us trade sanctions on countries such as iran north korea cuba sudan and syria

item 1a 

  

other regulatory areas that may apply to our products and online services offerings include user privacy telecommunications data protection and online content for example regulators may take the position that our offerings such as skype are covered by laws regulating telecommunications services applying these laws and regulations to our business is often unclear subject to change over time and sometimes may conflict from jurisdiction to jurisdiction additionally these laws and governments’ approach to their enforcement and our products and services are continuing to evolve some governments are expressing increasing concern about government surveillance practices around the world and this may lead to increased regulation requiring local hosting obligations or the use of domestic hosting providers compliance with these types of regulation may involve significant costs or require changes in products or business practices that result in reduced revenue noncompliance could result in the imposition of penalties or orders we stop the alleged noncompliant activity 

our business depends on our ability to attract and retain talented employees our business is based on successfully attracting and retaining talented employees the market for highly skilled workers and leaders in our industry is extremely competitive we are limited in our ability to recruit internationally by restrictive domestic immigration laws if we are less successful in our recruiting efforts or if we cannot retain key employees including key employees of the nds business acquired in april 2014 our ability to develop and deliver successful products and services may be adversely affected effective succession planning is also important to our longterm success failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution 

we have claims and lawsuits against us that may result in adverse outcomes we are subject to a variety of claims and lawsuits adverse outcomes in some or all of these claims may result in significant monetary damages or injunctive relief that could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business the litigation and other claims are subject to inherent uncertainties and management’s view of these matters may change in the future a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements could occur for the period in which the effect of an unfavorable final outcome becomes probable and reasonably estimable 

we may have additional tax liabilities we are subject to income taxes in the us and many foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes in the ordinary course of our business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain we regularly are under audit by tax authorities economic and political pressures to increase tax revenues in various jurisdictions may make resolving tax disputes more difficult although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals the results of an audit or litigation could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements in the period or periods for which that determination is made 

we earn a significant amount of our operating income from outside the us and any repatriation of funds currently held in foreign jurisdictions to the us may result in higher effective tax rates for the company in addition there have been proposals from congress to change us tax laws that would significantly impact how us multinational corporations are taxed on foreign earnings although we cannot predict whether or in what form any proposed legislation may pass if enacted it could have a material adverse impact on our tax expense and cash flows 

our hardware and software products may experience quality or supply problems our verticallyintegrated hardware products such as xbox consoles surface devices lumia smartphones and other devices we design and market are highly complex and can have defects in design manufacture or associated software we could incur significant expenses lost revenue and reputational harm if we fail to detect or address such issues through design testing or warranty repairs we get some device components from sole suppliers our competitors use some of the same suppliers and their demand for hardware components can affect the capacity available to us if a component from a solesource supplier is delayed or becomes unavailable whether because of supplier capacity constraint or industry shortages we may not obtain timely replacement supplies resulting in reduced sales component shortages excess or obsolete inventory or price reductions resulting in inventory adjustments may increase our cost of revenue xbox consoles and surface devices and lumia phones are assembled in asia and other geographies that may be subject to disruptions in the supply chain resulting in shortages that would affect our revenue and operating margins these same risks would apply to any other verticallyintegrated hardware and software products we may offer 

  

  

part i 

item 1a 

  

our software products also may experience quality or reliability problems the highly sophisticated software products we develop may contain bugs and other defects that interfere with their intended operation any defects we do not detect and fix in prerelease testing could cause reduced sales and revenue damage to our reputation repair or remediation costs delays in the release of new products or versions or legal liability although our license agreements typically contain provisions that eliminate or limit our exposure to liability there is no assurance these provisions will withstand legal challenge 

our global business exposes us to operational and economic risks we operate in over 100 countries and a significant part of our revenue comes from international sales the global nature of our business creates operational and economic risks emerging markets are a significant focus of our international growth strategy the developing nature of these markets presents several risks including deterioration of social political labor or economic conditions in a country or region and difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations although we hedge a portion of our international currency exposure significant fluctuations in exchange rates between the us dollar and foreign currencies may adversely affect our revenue competitive or regulatory pressure to make our pricing structure uniform might require that we reduce the sales price of our software in the us and other countries 

catastrophic events or geopolitical conditions may disrupt our business a disruption or failure of our systems or operations because of a major earthquake weather event cyberattack terrorist attack or other catastrophic event could cause delays in completing sales providing services or performing other critical functions our corporate headquarters a significant portion of our research and development activities and certain other essential business operations are in the seattle washington area and we have other business operations in the silicon valley area of california both of which are near major earthquake faults a catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our critical business or it systems could harm our ability to conduct normal business operations providing our customers with more services and solutions in the cloud puts a premium on the resilience of our systems and strength of our business continuity management plans and magnifies the potential impact of prolonged service outages on our operating results 

abrupt political change terrorist activity and armed conflict pose a risk of general economic disruption in affected countries which may increase our operating costs these conditions also may add uncertainty to the timing and budget for technology investment decisions by our customers and may cause supply chain disruptions for hardware manufacturers either of which may adversely affect our revenue the longterm effects of climate change on the global economy or the it industry in particular are unclear environmental regulations or changes in the supply demand or available sources of energy may affect the availability or cost of goods and services including natural resources necessary to run our business changes in weather where we operate may increase the costs of powering and cooling computer hardware we use to develop software and provide cloudbased services 

adverse economic or market conditions may harm our business worsening economic conditions including inflation recession or other changes in economic conditions may cause lower it spending and adversely affect our revenue if demand for pcs servers and other computing devices declines or consumer or business spending for those products declines our revenue will be adversely affected substantial revenue comes from our us government contracts an extended federal government shutdown resulting from failing to pass budget appropriations adopt continuing funding resolutions or raise the debt ceiling and other budgetary decisions limiting or delaying federal government spending could reduce government it spending on our products and services and adversely affect our revenues our product distribution system also relies on an extensive partner and retail network oems building devices that run our software have also been a significant means of distribution the impact of economic conditions on our partners such as the bankruptcy of a major distributor oem or retailer could cause sales channel disruption challenging economic conditions also may impair the ability of our customers to pay for products and services they have purchased as a result allowances for doubtful accounts and writeoffs of accounts receivable may increase we maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings types and maturities these investments are subject to general credit liquidity market and interest rate risks which may be exacerbated by unusual events that affect global financial markets a significant part of our investment portfolio comprises us government securities if global credit and equity markets decline for long periods or if there is a downgrade of the us government credit rating due to an actual or threatened default on government debt our investment portfolio may be adversely affected and we could determine that more of our investments have experienced an otherthantemporary decline in fair value requiring impairment charges that could adversely affect our financial results

we see opportunity in combining these services in new ways that are more contextual and personal while ensuring people rather than their devices remain at the center of the digital experience we will offer our services across ecosystems and devices outside our own as people move from device to device so will their content and the richness of their services we will engineer applications so users can find try and buy them in frictionfree ways 

cloud operating system 

today businesses face important opportunities and challenges enterprises are asked to deploy technology that advances business strategy they decide what solutions will make employees more productive collaborative and satisfied or connect with customers in new and compelling ways they work to unlock business insights from a world of data they rely on our technology to manage employee corporate identity and to manage and secure corporate information accessed and stored across a growing number of devices to achieve these objectives increasingly businesses look to leverage the benefits of the cloud helping businesses move to the cloud is one of our largest opportunities and we believe we work from a position of strength 

the shift to the cloud is driven by three important economies of scale larger datacenters can deploy computational resources at significantly lower cost per unit than smaller ones larger datacenters can coordinate and aggregate diverse customer geographic and application demand patterns improving the utilization of computing storage and network resources and multitenancy lowers application maintenance labor costs for large public clouds the cloud creates the opportunity for businesses to focus on innovation while leaving nondifferentiating activities to reliable and costeffective providers 

with azure we are one of very few cloud vendors that run at a scale that meets the needs of businesses of all sizes and complexities we believe the combination of azure and windows server makes us the only company with a public private and hybrid cloud platform that can power modern business we are working to enhance the return on it investment by enabling enterprises to combine their existing datacenters and our public cloud into a single cohesive infrastructure businesses can deploy applications in their own datacenter a partner’s datacenter or in our datacenters with common security management and administration across all environments with the flexibility and scale they desire 

our cloud will also enable richer employee experiences we enable organizations to securely adopt softwareasaservice applications both our own and thirdparty and integrate them with their existing security and management infrastructure we will continue to innovate with higher level services including identity and directory services rich data storage and analytics services machine learning services media services web and mobile backend services and developer productivity services to foster a rich developer ecosystem our digital work

and life experiences will also be extensible enabling customers and partners to further customize and enhance our solutions achieving even more value our strategy requires continuing investment in datacenters and other infrastructure to support our devices and services and will bring continued competition with google amazon and other wellestablished and emerging competitors 

device operating system and hardware 

with our windows device operating system and firstparty hardware we strive to set the standard for productivity experiences we aim to deliver the richest and most consistent user experience for digital work and life scenarios on screens of all sizes – from phones tablets and laptops to tvs and large multitouch displays we are investing to make windows the most secure manageable and capable operating system for the needs of a modern workforce we are working to create a broad developer opportunity by enabling universal windows applications to run across all device targets we are developing new inputoutput methods like speech pen and gesture to power more personal computing experiences 

we work with an ecosystem of partners to deliver a broad spectrum of windows devices we also build firstparty hardware to set the standard for productivity experiences and stimulate more demand for the entire windows ecosystem as we do with surface and with the acquisition of substantially all nokia corporation’s “nokia” devices and services business “nds” on april 25 2014 phones as consumer services and hardware advance we expect they will continue to better complement one another connecting the devices people use daily to unique communications productivity and entertainment services from microsoft and our partners and developers we anticipate many new mobile device categories and we anticipate experiences to emerge that span a variety of devices of all screen sizes we will invest to be on the forefront of this innovation focusing on dual users and their needs across work and life with the acquisition of nds we expect our effective tax rate to increase as our business mix changes

fiscal year 2014 compared with fiscal year 2013 

our effective tax rate for fiscal years 2014 and 2013 was approximately 21 and 19 respectively our effective tax rate was lower than the us federal statutory rate primarily due to earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting from producing and distributing our products and services through our foreign regional operations centers in ireland singapore and puerto rico 

our fiscal year 2014 effective rate increased by 2 from fiscal year 2013 mainly due to adjustments of 458 million to prior years’ liabilities for intercompany transfer pricing that increased taxable income in more highly taxed jurisdictions as well as losses incurred by nds and changes in the geographic mix of our business this was offset in part by favorable transfer pricing developments in certain foreign tax jurisdictions primarily denmark 

changes in the mix of income before income taxes between the us and foreign countries also impacted our effective tax rates and resulted primarily from changes in the geographic distribution of and changes in consumer demand for our products and services we supply our windows pc operating system to customers through our us regional operating center while we supply the microsoft office system and our server products and tools to customers through our foreign regional operations centers windows pc operating system revenue decreased 655 million in fiscal year 2014 while microsoft office system and server products and tools revenue increased 13 billion and 16 billion respectively during this same period in fiscal years 2014 and 2013 our us income before income taxes was 71 billion and 67 billion respectively and comprised 26 and 25 respectively of our income before income taxes in fiscal years 2014 and 2013 the foreign income before income taxes was 207 billion and 204 billion respectively and comprised 74 and 75 respectively of our income before income taxes

our fiscal year 2013 effective rate decreased by 5 from fiscal year 2012 mainly due to a nonrecurring 62 billion nontax deductible goodwill impairment charge that was recorded in fiscal year 2012 the goodwill impairment charge increased our effective tax rate by 10 in fiscal year 2012 in addition in fiscal years 2013 and 2012 we recognized a reduction of 18 and 21 respectively to the effective tax rate due to foreign earnings taxed at lower rates the decrease in our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2013 was primarily offset by a 1 increase related to the eu fine which is not tax deductible 

changes in the mix of income before income taxes between the us and foreign countries also impacted our effective tax rates and resulted primarily from changes in the geographic distribution of and changes in consumer demand for our products and services we supply our windows pc operating system to customers through our us regional operating center while we supply the microsoft office system and our server products and tools to customers through our foreign regional operations centers windows pc operating system revenue increased 209 million in fiscal year 2013 while microsoft office system and server products and tools revenue increased 696 million and 12 billion respectively during this same period in fiscal years 2013 and 2012 our us income before income taxes was 67 billion and 16 billion respectively and comprised 25 and 7 respectively of our income before income taxes in fiscal years 2013 and 2012 the foreign income before income taxes was 204 billion and 207 billion respectively and comprised 75 and 93 respectively of our income before income taxes the primary driver for the increase in the us income before income tax in fiscal year 2013 was the goodwill impairment charge recorded during the prior year 

tax contingencies and other tax liabilities were 94 billion and 76 billion as of june 30 2013 and 2012 respectively and are included in other longterm liabilities this increase relates primarily to transfer pricing including transfer pricing developments in certain foreign tax jurisdictions primarily denmark while we settled a portion of the irs audit for tax years 2004 to 2006 during the third quarter of fiscal year 2011 we remain under audit for those years in february 2012 the irs withdrew its 2011 revenue agents report and reopened the audit phase of the examination as of june 30 2013 the primary unresolved issue relates to transfer pricing which could have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements if not resolved favorably we do not believe it is reasonably possible that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits will significantly increase or decrease within the next 12 months because we do not believe the remaining open issues will be resolved within the next 12 months we also continue to be subject to examination by the irs for tax years 2007 to 2012 

we are subject to income tax in many jurisdictions outside the us our operations in certain jurisdictions remain subject to examination for tax years 1996 to 2012 some of which are currently under audit by local tax authorities the resolutions of these audits are not expected to be material to our consolidated financial statements 

financial condition 

cash cash equivalents and investments 

cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments totaled 857 billion as of june 30 2014 compared with 770 billion as of june 30 2013 equity and other investments were 146 billion as of june 30 2014 compared with 108 billion as of june 30 2013 our shortterm investments are primarily to facilitate liquidity and for capital preservation they consist predominantly of highly liquid investmentgrade fixedincome securities diversified among industries and individual issuers the investments are predominantly us dollardenominated securities but also include foreign currencydenominated securities in order to diversify risk our fixedincome investments are exposed to interest rate risk and credit risk the credit risk and average maturity of our fixedincome portfolio are

managed to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain fixedincome indices the settlement risk related to these investments is insignificant given that the shortterm investments held are primarily highly liquid investmentgrade fixedincome securities 

of the cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments at june 30 2014 771 billion was held by our foreign subsidiaries and would be subject to material repatriation tax effects the amount of cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments held by foreign subsidiaries subject to other restrictions on the free flow of funds primarily currency and other local regulatory was 26 billion as of june 30 2014 approximately 84 of the cash equivalents and shortterm investments held by our foreign subsidiaries were invested in us government and agency securities approximately 5 were invested in corporate notes and bonds of us companies and approximately 1 were invested in us mortgagebacked securities all of which are denominated in us dollars 

securities lending 

we lend certain fixedincome and equity securities to increase investment returns the loaned securities continue to be carried as investments on our balance sheet cash andor security interests are received as collateral for the loaned securities with the amount determined based upon the underlying security lent and the creditworthiness of the borrower cash received is recorded as an asset with a corresponding liability our securities lending payable balance was 558 million as of june 30 2014 our average and maximum securities lending payable balances for the fiscal year were 619 million and 13 billion respectively intrayear variances in the amount of securities loaned are mainly due to fluctuations in the demand for the securities 

valuation 

in general and where applicable we use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities to determine the fair value of our financial instruments this pricing methodology applies to our level 1 investments such as exchangetraded mutual funds domestic and international equities and us government securities if quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities are not available to determine fair value then we use quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities or inputs other than the quoted prices that are observable either directly or indirectly this pricing methodology applies to our level 2 investments such as corporate notes and bonds common and preferred stock foreign government bonds mortgagebacked securities and certificates of deposit level 3 investments are valued using internally developed models with unobservable inputs assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis using unobservable inputs are an immaterial portion of our portfolio 

a majority of our investments are priced by pricing vendors and are generally level 1 or level 2 investments as these vendors either provide a quoted market price in an active market or use observable inputs for their pricing without applying significant adjustments broker pricing is used mainly when a quoted price is not available the investment is not priced by our pricing vendors or when a broker price is more reflective of fair values in the market in which the investment trades our brokerpriced investments are generally classified as level 2 investments because the broker prices these investments based on similar assets without applying significant adjustments in addition all of our brokerpriced investments have a sufficient level of trading volume to demonstrate that the fair values used are appropriate for these investments our fair value processes include controls that are designed to ensure appropriate fair values are recorded these controls include model validation review of key model inputs analysis of periodoverperiod fluctuations and independent recalculation of prices where appropriate 

cash flows 

fiscal year 2014 compared with fiscal year 2013 

cash flows from operations increased 34 billion during the current fiscal year to 322 billion due mainly to increases in cash received from customers cash used in financing increased 246 million to 84 billion due mainly to a 20 billion increase in cash used for common stock repurchases a 14 billion increase in dividends paid and a 324 million decrease in proceeds from the issuance of common stock offset in part by a 34 billion increase in

fiscal year 2013 compared with fiscal year 2012 

cash flows from operations decreased 28 billion during the current fiscal year to 288 billion due mainly to changes in working capital including increases in inventory and other current assets cash used for financing decreased 13 billion to 81 billion due mainly to a 35 billion increase in proceeds from issuances of debt net of repayments offset in part by a 11 billion increase in dividends paid and a 982 million decrease in proceeds from the issuance of common stock cash used in investing decreased 975 million to 238 billion due mainly to an 85 billion decrease in cash used for acquisitions of companies and purchases of intangible and other assets offset in part by a 58 billion increase in cash used for net investment purchases maturities and sales and a 20 billion increase in cash used for additions to property and equipment 

debt 

we issued debt to take advantage of favorable pricing and liquidity in the debt markets reflecting our credit rating and the low interest rate environment the proceeds of these issuances were or will be used for general corporate purposes which may include among other things funding for working capital capital expenditures repurchases of capital stock acquisitions and repayment of existing debt 

as of june 30 2014 we had 226 billion of issued and outstanding debt comprising 20 billion of shortterm debt and 206 billion of longterm debt 

shortterm debt 

as of june 30 2014 we had 20 billion of commercial paper issued and outstanding with a weightedaverage interest rate of 012 and maturities ranging from 86 days to 91 days the estimated fair value of this commercial paper approximates its carrying value 

we have a 50 billion credit facility that expires on november 14 2018 which serves as a backup for our commercial paper program as of june 30 2014 we were in compliance with the only financial covenant in the credit agreement which requires us to maintain a coverage ratio of at least three times earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization to interest expense as defined in the credit agreement no amounts were drawn against the credit facility during any of the periods presented 

longterm debt 

as of june 30 2014 the total carrying value and estimated fair value of our longterm debt were 206 billion and 215 billion respectively these estimated fair values are based on level 2 inputs

   the notes in this table are senior unsecured obligations and rank equally with our other senior unsecured debt outstanding interest on these notes is paid semiannually except for the eurodenominated debt securities on which interest is paid annually as of june 30 2014 the aggregate unamortized discount for our longterm debt was 100 million 

unearned revenue 

unearned revenue at june 30 2014 was comprised mainly of unearned revenue from volume licensing programs unearned revenue from volume licensing programs represents customer billings for multiyear licensing arrangements paid for either at inception of the agreement or annually at the beginning of each coverage period and accounted for as subscriptions with revenue recognized ratably over the coverage period unearned revenue at june 30 2014 also included payments for postdelivery support and consulting services to be performed in the future xbox live subscriptions and prepaid points microsoft dynamics business solutions products office 365 subscriptions bundled offerings skype prepaid credits and subscriptions and other offerings for which we have been paid in advance and earn the revenue when we provide the service or software or otherwise meet the revenue recognition criteria

 share repurchases 

on september 16 2013 our board of directors approved a new share repurchase program authorizing up to 400 billion in share repurchases the share repurchase program became effective on october 1 2013 has no expiration date and may be suspended or discontinued at any time without notice as of june 30 2014 351 billion remained of the 400 billion share repurchase program 

during fiscal year 2014 we repurchased 175 million shares of microsoft common stock for 64 billion 128 million shares were repurchased for 49 billion under the share repurchase program approved by our board of directors on september 16 2013 and 47 million shares were repurchased for 15 billion under the share repurchase program that was announced on september 22 2008 and expired september 30 2013 during fiscal years 2013 and 2012 we repurchased 158 million shares for 46 billion and 142 million shares for 40 billion respectively under the share repurchase program announced on september 22 2008 all repurchases were made using cash resources 

dividends 

during fiscal years 2014 and 2013 our board of directors declared the following dividends 

 

 offbalance sheet arrangements 

we provide indemnifications of varying scope and size to certain customers against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products and certain other matters in evaluating estimated losses on these indemnifications we consider factors such as the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and our ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss these obligations did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements during the periods presented

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes the payments due by fiscal year for our outstanding contractual obligations as of june 30 2014 

 

  

     other planned uses of capital 

we will continue to invest in sales marketing product support infrastructure and existing and advanced areas of technology additions to property and equipment will continue including new facilities data centers and computer systems for research and development sales and marketing support and administrative staff we expect capital expenditures to increase in coming years in support of our cloud and devices strategy we have operating leases for most us and international sales and support offices and certain equipment we have not engaged in any related party transactions or arrangements with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect liquidity or the availability of capital resources 

liquidity 

we earn a significant amount of our operating income outside the us which is deemed to be permanently reinvested in foreign jurisdictions as a result as discussed above under cash cash equivalents and investments the majority of our cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments are held by foreign subsidiaries we currently do not intend nor foresee a need to repatriate these funds we expect existing domestic cash cash equivalents shortterm investments and cash flows from operations to continue to be sufficient to fund our domestic operating activities and cash commitments for investing and financing activities such as regular quarterly dividends debt repayment schedules and material capital expenditures for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future in addition we expect existing foreign cash cash equivalents shortterm investments and cash flows from operations to continue to be sufficient to fund our foreign operating activities and cash commitments for investing activities such as material capital expenditures for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future 

should we require more capital in the us than is generated by our operations domestically for example to fund significant discretionary activities such as business acquisitions and share repurchases we could elect to repatriate future earnings from foreign jurisdictions or raise capital in the us through debt or equity issuances these alternatives could result in higher effective tax rates increased interest expense or dilution of our earnings we have borrowed funds domestically and continue to believe we have the ability to do so at reasonable interest rates

recent accounting guidance 

recently adopted accounting guidance 

in december 2011 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued guidance enhancing disclosure requirements about the nature of an entity’s right to offset and related arrangements associated with its financial instruments the new guidance requires the disclosure of the gross amounts subject to rights of setoff amounts offset in accordance with the accounting standards followed and the related net exposure in january 2013 the fasb clarified that the scope of this guidance applies to derivatives repurchase agreements and securities lending arrangements that are either offset or subject to an enforceable master netting arrangement or similar agreements we adopted this new guidance beginning july 1 2013 adoption of this new guidance resulted only in changes to the presentation of note 5 – derivatives of the notes to financial statements 

in february 2013 the fasb issued guidance on disclosure requirements for items reclassified out of aoci this new guidance requires entities to present either on the face of the income statement or in the notes to financial statements the effects on the line items of the income statement for amounts reclassified out of aoci we adopted this new guidance beginning july 1 2013 adoption of this new guidance resulted only in changes to the presentation of note 19 – accumulated other comprehensive income of the notes to financial statements 

recent accounting guidance not yet adopted 

in march 2013 the fasb issued guidance on a parent’s accounting for the cumulative translation adjustment upon derecognition of a subsidiary or group of assets within a foreign entity this new guidance requires that the parent release any related cumulative translation adjustment into net income only if the sale or transfer results in the complete or substantially complete liquidation of the foreign entity in which the subsidiary or group of assets had resided the new guidance will be effective for us beginning july 1 2014 we do not anticipate material impacts on our consolidated financial statements upon adoption 

in may 2014 as part of its ongoing efforts to assist in the convergence of us gaap and international financial reporting standards the fasb issued a new standard related to revenue recognition under the new standard recognition of revenue occurs when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services in addition the standard requires disclosure of the nature amount timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers the new standard will be effective for us beginning july 1 2017 and early adoption is not permitted we anticipate this standard will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and we are currently evaluating its impact 

application of critical accounting policies 

our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with us gaap preparing consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses these estimates and assumptions are affected by management’s application of accounting policies critical accounting policies for us include revenue recognition impairment of investment securities goodwill research and development costs contingencies income taxes and inventories 

revenue recognition 

revenue recognition for multipleelement arrangements requires judgment to determine if multiple elements exist whether elements can be accounted for as separate units of accounting and if so the fair value for each of the elements 

judgment is also required to assess whether future releases of certain software represent new products or upgrades and enhancements to existing products certain volume licensing arrangements include a perpetual license for 

  

  

part ii 

item 7 

  

current products combined with rights to receive unspecified future versions of software products “software assurance” and are accounted for as subscriptions with billings recorded as unearned revenue and recognized as revenue ratably over the coverage period 

software updates are evaluated on a casebycase basis to determine whether they meet the definition of an upgrade which may require revenue to be deferred and recognized when the upgrade is delivered if it is determined that implied postcontract customer support “pcs” is being provided revenue from the arrangement is deferred and recognized over the implied pcs term if updates are determined to not meet the definition of an upgrade revenue is generally recognized as products are shipped or made available 

microsoft enters into arrangements that can include various combinations of software services and hardware where elements are delivered over different periods of time and when allowed under us gaap revenue is allocated to the respective elements based on their relative selling prices at the inception of the arrangement and revenue is recognized as each element is delivered we use a hierarchy to determine the fair value to be used for allocating revenue to elements i vendorspecific objective evidence of fair value “vsoe” ii thirdparty evidence and iii best estimate of selling price “esp” for software elements we follow the industry specific software guidance which only allows for the use of vsoe in establishing fair value generally vsoe is the price charged when the deliverable is sold separately or the price established by management for a product that is not yet sold if it is probable that the price will not change before introduction into the marketplace esps are established as best estimates of what the selling prices would be if the deliverables were sold regularly on a standalone basis our process for determining esps requires judgment and considers multiple factors that may vary over time depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each deliverable 

windows 7 revenue was subject to deferral as a result of the windows upgrade offer which started june 2 2012 the offer provided significantly discounted rights to purchase windows 8 pro to qualifying endusers that purchased windows 7 pcs during the eligibility period microsoft was responsible for delivering windows 8 pro to the end customer accordingly revenue related to the allocated discount for undelivered windows 8 was deferred until it was delivered or the redemption period expired 

impairment of investment securities 

we review investments quarterly for indicators of otherthantemporary impairment this determination requires significant judgment in making this judgment we employ a systematic methodology quarterly that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments if the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value we evaluate among other factors general market conditions credit quality of debt instrument issuers the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost and for equity securities our intent and ability to hold or plans to sell the investment for fixedincome securities we also evaluate whether we have plans to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery we also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the investee including industry and sector performance changes in technology and operational and financing cash flow factors once a decline in fair value is determined to be otherthantemporary an impairment charge is recorded to other income expense and a new cost basis in the investment is established if market industry andor investee conditions deteriorate we may incur future impairments 

goodwill 

we allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the business combination we evaluate our reporting units on an annual basis and if necessary reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level operating segment or one level below an operating segment on an annual basis may 1 for us and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value these events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate legal factors operating performance indicators competition or sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit 

  

  

part ii 

item 7 

  

application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment including the identification of reporting units assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units assignment of goodwill to reporting units and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit the fair value of each reporting unit is estimated primarily through the use of a discounted cash flow methodology this analysis requires significant judgments including estimation of future cash flows which is dependent on internal forecasts estimation of the longterm rate of growth for our business estimation of the useful life over which cash flows will occur and determination of our weighted average cost of capital 

the estimates used to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit change from year to year based on operating results market conditions and other factors changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and goodwill impairment for each reporting unit 

the valuation of acquired assets and liabilities including goodwill resulting from the acquisition of nds is reflective of the enterprise value based on the longterm financial forecast for the business in this highly competitive and volatile market it is possible that we may not realize our forecasts given the value assigned to goodwill in the purchase price allocation we will closely monitor the performance of the business versus the longterm forecast to determine if any impairments arise 

research and development costs 

costs incurred internally in researching and developing a computer software product are charged to expense until technological feasibility has been established for the product once technological feasibility is established all software costs are capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers judgment is required in determining when technological feasibility of a product is established we have determined that technological feasibility for our software products is reached after all highrisk development issues have been resolved through coding and testing generally this occurs shortly before the products are released to manufacturing the amortization of these costs is included in cost of revenue over the estimated life of the products 

legal and other contingencies 

the outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought against us are subject to significant uncertainty an estimated loss from a loss contingency such as a legal proceeding or claim is accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated in determining whether a loss should be accrued we evaluate among other factors the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss changes in these factors could materially impact our consolidated financial statements 

income taxes 

the objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity’s financial statements or tax returns we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement accounting literature also provides guidance on derecognition of income tax assets and liabilities classification of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities accounting for interest and penalties associated with tax positions and income tax disclosures judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our consolidated financial statements 

inventories 

inventories are stated at average cost subject to the lower of cost or market cost includes materials labor and manufacturing overhead related to the purchase and production of inventories we regularly review inventory

item 7 

  

quantities on hand future purchase commitments with our suppliers and the estimated utility of our inventory these reviews include analysis of demand forecasts product life cycle status product development plans current sales levels pricing strategy and component cost trends if our review indicates a reduction in utility below carrying value we reduce our inventory to a new cost basis through a charge to cost of revenue the determination of market value and the estimated volume of demand used in the lower of cost or market analysis require significant judgment

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

risks 

we are exposed to economic risk from foreign currency exchange rates interest rates credit risk equity prices and commodity prices a portion of these risks is hedged but they may impact our consolidated financial statements 

foreign currency 

certain forecasted transactions assets and liabilities are exposed to foreign currency risk we monitor our foreign currency exposures daily and use hedges where practicable to offset the risks and maximize the economic effectiveness of our foreign currency positions principal currencies hedged include the euro japanese yen british pound and canadian dollar 

interest rate 

our fixedincome portfolio is diversified across credit sectors and maturities consisting primarily of investmentgrade securities the credit risk and average maturity of the fixedincome portfolio is managed to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain global and domestic fixedincome indices in addition we use “to be announced” forward purchase commitments of mortgagebacked assets to gain exposure to agency and mortgagebacked securities 

equity 

our equity portfolio consists of global developed and emerging market securities that are subject to market price risk we manage the securities relative to certain global and domestic indices and expect their economic risk and return to correlate with these indices 

commodity 

we use broadbased commodity exposures to enhance portfolio returns and facilitate portfolio diversification our investment portfolio has exposure to a variety of commodities including precious metals energy and grain we manage these exposures relative to global commodity indices and expect their economic risk and return to correlate with these indices 

valueatrisk 

we use a valueatrisk “var” model to estimate and quantify our market risks var is the expected loss for a given confidence level in the fair value of our portfolio due to adverse market movements over a defined time horizon the var model is not intended to represent actual losses in fair value including determinations of otherthantemporary losses in fair value in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states “us gaap” but is used as a risk estimation and management tool the distribution of the potential changes in total market value of all holdings is computed based on the historical volatilities and correlations among foreign currency exchange rates interest rates equity prices and commodity prices assuming normal market conditions 

the var is calculated as the total loss that will not be exceeded at the 975 percentile confidence level or alternatively stated the losses could exceed the var in 25 out of 1000 cases several risk factors are not captured in the model including liquidity risk operational risk and legal risk

the following table sets forth the oneday var for substantially all of our positions as of june 30 2014 and 2013 and for the year ended june 30 2014 

 

 total oneday var for the combined risk categories was 333 million at june 30 2014 and 350 million at june 30 2013 the total var is 25 less at june 30 2014 and 28 less at june 30 2013 than the sum of the separate risk categories in the table above due to the diversification benefit of the combination of risks

approximately 85 of mbd revenue is generated from sales to businesses which includes office revenue generated through subscriptions and volume licensing agreements as well as microsoft dynamics revenue revenue from sales to businesses generally depends upon the number of information workers in a licensed enterprise and is therefore relatively independent of the number of pcs sold in a given year approximately 15 of mbd revenue is derived from sales to consumers which includes revenue from retail packaged product subscription sales and oem revenue this revenue generally is affected by the level of pc shipments the shift to subscriptionbased licensing and product launches

competition 

our xbox gaming and entertainment business competes with console platforms from nintendo and sony both of which have a large established base of customers the lifecycle for gaming and entertainment consoles averages five to 10 years we released xbox 360 in november 2005 nintendo and sony released competing versions of their game consoles in november 2006 in june 2013 we announced that we expect our next generation console xbox one to be available for purchase in the second quarter of fiscal year 2014 sony also announced their next generation console will be available for purchase in late 2013 nintendo released their latest generation console in november 2012 

we believe the success of gaming and entertainment consoles is determined by the availability of games for the console providing exclusive game content that gamers seek the computational power and reliability of the console and the ability to create new experiences via online services downloadable content and peripherals in addition to nintendo and sony our businesses compete with both apple and google in offering content products and services to the consumer we believe the xbox entertainment platform is positioned well against competitive products and services based on significant innovation in hardware architecture user interface developer tools online gaming and entertainment services and continued strong exclusive content from our own game franchises as well as other digital content offerings 

windows phone faces competition primarily from apple google and blackberry skype competes primarily with apple and google which offer a selection of instant messaging voice and video communication products 

we compete primarily on the basis of product quality and variety unique capabilities of our products timing of product releases and effectiveness of distribution and marketing

to serve the needs of customers around the world and to improve the quality and usability of products in international markets we localize many of our products to reflect local languages and conventions localizing a product may require modifying the user interface altering dialog boxes and translating text 

we contract most of our manufacturing activities for xbox 360 and related games kinect for xbox 360 various retail software packaged products surface devices and microsoft pc accessories to third parties our products may include some components that are available from only one or limited sources our xbox 360 console kinect for xbox 360 surface devices and microsoft pc accessories include key components that are supplied by a single source the integrated central processing unitgraphics processing unit for the xbox 360 console is purchased from ibm and the supporting embedded dynamic random access memory chips are purchased from taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company we generally have the ability to use other manufacturers if the current vendor becomes unavailable or unable to meet our requirements we generally have multiple sources for raw materials supplies and components and are often able to acquire component parts and materials on a volume discount basis 

research and development 

during fiscal years 2013 2012 and 2011 research and development expense was 104 billion 98 billion and 90 billion respectively these amounts represented 13 of revenue in each of those years we plan to continue to make significant investments in a broad range of research and development efforts

product and service development and intellectual property 

we develop most of our products and services internally internal development allows us to maintain competitive advantages that come from product differentiation and closer technical control over our products and services it also gives us the freedom to decide which modifications and enhancements are most important and when they should be implemented we strive to obtain information as early as possible about changing usage patterns and hardware advances that may affect software design before releasing new software platforms we provide application vendors with a range of resources and guidelines for development training and testing generally we also create product documentation internally 

we protect our intellectual property investments in a variety of ways we work actively in the us and internationally to ensure the enforcement of copyright trademark trade secret and other protections that apply to our software and hardware products services business plans and branding we are a leader among technology companies in pursuing patents and currently have a portfolio of over 35000 us and international patents issued and over 38000 pending while we employ much of our internally developed intellectual property exclusively in microsoft products and services we also engage in outbound and inbound licensing of specific patented technologies that are incorporated into licensees’ or microsoft’s products from time to time we enter into broader crosslicense agreements with other technology companies covering entire groups of patents we also purchase or license technology that we incorporate into our products or services at times we make select intellectual property broadly available at no or low cost to achieve a strategic objective such as promoting industry standards advancing interoperability or attracting and enabling our external development community 

while it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of our products and business methods we believe based upon past experience and industry practice such licenses generally could be obtained on commercially reasonable terms we believe our continuing research and product development are not materially dependent on any single license or other agreement with a third party relating to the development of our products 

investing in the future 

microsoft’s success is based on our ability to create new and compelling products services and experiences for our users to initiate and embrace disruptive technology trends to enter new geographic and product markets and to drive broad adoption of our products and services we invest in a range of emerging technology trends and breakthroughs that we believe offer significant opportunities to deliver value to our customers and growth for the company we maintain our longterm commitment to research and development across a wide spectrum of technologies tools and platforms spanning communication and collaboration information access and organization entertainment business and ecommerce advertising and devices 

while our main research and development facilities are located in redmond washington we also operate research and development facilities in other parts of the us and around the world including canada china denmark estonia germany india ireland israel and the united kingdom this global approach helps us remain competitive in local markets and enables us to continue to attract top talent from across the world we generally fund research at the corporate level to ensure that we are looking beyond immediate product considerations to opportunities further in the future we also fund research and development activities at the business segment level much of our business segment level research and development is coordinated with other segments and leveraged across the company 

in addition to our main research and development operations we also operate microsoft research microsoft research is one of the world’s largest computer science research organizations and works in close collaboration with top universities around the world to advance the stateoftheart in computer science providing us a unique perspective on future technology trends

 item 1a risk factors 

our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties including those described below that could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations cash flows and the trading price of our common stock 

we face intense competition across all markets for our products and services which may lead to lower revenue or operating margins 

competition in the technology sector 

our competitors range in size from diversified global companies with significant research and development resources to small specialized firms whose narrower product lines may let them be more effective in deploying technical marketing and financial resources barriers to entry in our businesses generally are low and software products can be distributed broadly and quickly at relatively low cost many of the areas in which we compete evolve rapidly with changing and disruptive technologies shifting user needs and frequent introductions of new products and services our ability to remain competitive depends on our success in making innovative products devices and services that appeal to businesses and consumers 

competition among platforms ecosystems and devices 

an important element of our business model has been to create platformbased ecosystems on which many participants can build diverse solutions a wellestablished ecosystem creates beneficial network effects among users application developers and the platform provider that can accelerate growth establishing significant scale in the marketplace is necessary to achieve and maintain attractive margins the strategic importance of developing and maintaining a vibrant ecosystem increased with the launch of the windows 8 operating system surface windows phone and associated cloudbased services we face significant competition from firms that provide competing platforms applications and services

business model competition 

companies compete with us based on a growing variety of business models 

 

  

  

 the competitive pressures described above may result in decreased sales volumes price reductions andor increased operating costs such as for marketing and sales incentives this may lead to lower revenue gross margins and operating income 

our increasing focus on services presents execution and competitive risks a growing part of our strategy involves cloudbased services used with smart devices our competitors are rapidly developing and deploying cloudbased services for consumers and business customers pricing and delivery models are evolving devices and form factors influence how users access services in the cloud and in some cases the user’s choice of which suite of cloudbased services to use we are devoting significant resources to develop and deploy our own competing cloudbased strategies the windows ecosystem must continue to evolve with this changing environment while we believe our expertise investments in infrastructure and the breadth of our cloudbased services provide us with a strong foundation to compete it is uncertain whether our strategies will attract the users or generate the revenue required to be successful in addition to software development costs we are incurring costs to build and maintain infrastructure to support cloud computing services these costs may reduce the operating margins we have previously achieved whether we are successful in this new business model depends on our execution in a number of areas including 

 

  

  

  

 in july 2013 we announced a change in organizational structure as part of our transformation to a devices and services company this change in structure is designed to enable us to innovate with greater speed efficiency and capability in the fastchanging competitive environment we expect this change to alter the way we plan develop and market our products and services as we pursue a single strategy to offer a family of devices and services designed to empower our customers for the activities they value most it is uncertain whether our “one microsoft” strategy will yield the anticipated efficiencies or competitive benefits 

as we increasingly license cloudbased versions of our products and services such as office 365 rather than licensing transactionbased products and services the associated revenue will shift from being recognized at the time of the transaction to being recognized over the period of the subscription

we make significant investments in new products and services that may not be profitable we will continue to make significant investments in research development and marketing for existing products services and technologies including the windows operating system the microsoft office system bing windows phone windows server the windows store the windows azure services platform office 365 other cloudbased services offerings and the xbox 360 entertainment platform we will continue to invest in new software and hardware products services and technologies such as the microsoftdesigned and manufactured surface launched in october 2012 investments in new technology are speculative commercial success depends on many factors including innovativeness developer support and effective distribution and marketing if customers do not perceive our latest offerings as providing significant new functionality or other value they may reduce their purchases of new software products or upgrades unfavorably impacting revenue we may not achieve significant revenue from new product service and distribution channel investments for a number of years if at all moreover new products and services may not be profitable and even if they are profitable operating margins for some new products and businesses will not be as high as the margins we have experienced historically 

in october 2012 we launched windows 8 a major new release of our operating system which seeks to deliver a unique user experience through wellintegrated software hardware and services its success depends on a number of factors including the extent to which customers embrace the new user interface and functionality successfully coordinating with our oem partners in releasing a variety of hardware devices that take advantage of new features pricing windows 8based devices competitively and attracting developers at scale to ensure a competitive array of quality applications the marketing costs we are incurring to promote windows 8 and associated services and devices may reduce our operating margins 

acquisitions joint ventures and strategic alliances may have an adverse effect on our business we expect to continue making acquisitions or entering into joint ventures and strategic alliances as part of our longterm business strategy these transactions involve significant challenges and risks including that the transaction does not advance our business strategy that we do not realize a satisfactory return on our investment that we experience difficulty integrating new employees business systems and technology or that the transaction diverts management’s attention from our other businesses our acquisition of skype for example provides opportunities to enhance our existing products the success of this acquisition will depend in part on our ability to provide compelling experiences that distinguish us from our competitors in both consumer and business markets it may take longer than expected to realize the full benefits from these transactions such as increased revenue enhanced efficiencies or increased market share or the benefits may ultimately be smaller than anticipated or may not be realized these events could harm our operating results or financial condition 

we may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property rights protecting our global intellectual property rights and combating unlicensed copying and use of our software and other intellectual property is difficult while piracy adversely affects us revenue the impact on revenue from outside the us is more significant particularly in countries where laws are less protective of intellectual property rights as a result our revenue in these markets may grow slower than the underlying pc market similarly the absence of harmonized patent laws makes it more difficult to ensure consistent respect for patent rights throughout the world we actively educate consumers about the benefits of licensing genuine products and obtaining indemnification benefits for intellectual property risks and we educate lawmakers about the advantages of a business climate where intellectual property rights are protected however continued educational and enforcement efforts may fail to enhance revenue reductions in the legal protection for software intellectual property rights could adversely affect revenue 

third parties may claim we infringe their intellectual property rights from time to time we receive notices from others claiming we infringe their intellectual property rights the number of these claims may grow because of constant technological change in the segments in which we compete the extensive patent coverage of existing technologies the rapid rate of issuance of new patents and our offering of microsoftbranded services and hardware devices such as surface to resolve these claims we may enter into royalty and licensing agreements on terms that are less favorable than currently available stop selling or redesign affected products or services or pay damages to satisfy indemnification commitments with our customers these outcomes may cause operating margins to decline in addition to money damages in some jurisdictions plaintiffs can seek injunctive relief that may limit or prevent importing marketing and selling our products or services that have infringing technologies in some countries such

as germany an injunction can be issued before the parties have fully litigated the validity of the underlying patents we have made and expect to continue making significant expenditures to settle claims related to the use of technology and intellectual property rights and to procure intellectual property rights as part of our strategy to manage this risk 

we may not be able to protect our source code from copying if there is an unauthorized disclosure of source code source code the detailed program commands for our operating systems and other software programs is critical to our business although we license portions of our application and operating system source code to a number of licensees we take significant measures to protect the secrecy of large portions of our source code if an unauthorized disclosure of a significant portion of our source code occurs we could potentially lose future trade secret protection for that source code it may become easier for third parties to compete with our products by copying functionality which could adversely affect our revenue and operating margins unauthorized disclosure of source code also could increase the security risks described in the next paragraph 

cyberattacks and security vulnerabilities could lead to reduced revenue increased costs liability claims or harm to our competitive position 

security of microsoft’s information technology 

maintaining the security of computers and computer networks is paramount for us and our customers threats to information technology “it” security can take a variety of forms hackers develop and deploy viruses worms and other malicious software programs that attack our products and services and gain access to our networks and data centers groups of hackers may also act in a coordinated manner to launch distributed denial of service attacks or other coordinated attacks sophisticated organizations individuals or governments launch targeted attacks to gain access to our network breaches of our network or data security could disrupt and compromise the security of our internal systems and business applications impair our ability to provide services to our customers and protect the privacy of their data result in product development delays compromise confidential or technical business information harming our competitive position result in theft or misuse of our intellectual property or otherwise adversely affect our business 

in addition our internal it environment continues to evolve often we are early adopters of new devices and technologies we embrace new ways of sharing data and communicating internally and with partners and customers using methods such as social networking and other consumeroriented technologies these practices can enhance efficiency and business insight but they also present risks that our business policies and internal security controls may not keep pace with the speed of these changes 

security of our customers’ products and services 

security threats are a particular challenge to companies like us whose business is technology products and services the threats to our own it infrastructure also affect our customers customers using our cloudbased services rely on the security of our infrastructure to ensure the reliability of our services and the protection of their data hackers tend to focus their efforts on the most popular operating systems programs and services including many of ours and we expect them to continue to do so the security of our products and services is an important consideration in our customers’ purchasing decisions 

we devote significant resources to defend against security threats both to our internal it systems and those of our customers these include

 the cost of these steps could reduce our operating margins despite these efforts actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products and services could cause significant reputational harm and lead some customers to reduce or delay future purchases of products or subscriptions to services or to use competing products or services customers may also increase their expenditures on protecting their existing computer systems from attack which could delay adoption of additional products or services any of these actions by customers could adversely affect our revenue actual or perceived vulnerabilities may lead to claims against us although our license agreements typically contain provisions that eliminate or limit our exposure to such liability there is no assurance these provisions will withstand legal challenges legislative or regulatory action may increase the costs to develop or implement our products and services 

improper disclosure of personal data could result in liability and harm our reputation as we continue to grow the number and scale of our cloudbased offerings we store and process increasingly large amounts of personally identifiable information of our customers at the same time the continued occurrence of highprofile data breaches provides evidence of an external environment increasingly hostile to information security this environment demands that we continuously improve our design and coordination of security controls across our business groups and geographies despite these efforts it is possible our security controls over personal data our training of employees and vendors on data security and other practices we follow may not prevent the improper disclosure of personally identifiable information that we or our vendors store and manage improper disclosure of this information could harm our reputation lead to legal exposure to customers or subject us to liability under laws that protect personal data resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue our software products and services also enable our customers to store and process personal data on premise or increasingly in a cloudbased environment we host we believe consumers using our email messaging storage sharing and social networking services will increasingly want efficient centralized methods of choosing their privacy preferences and controlling their data perceptions that our products or services do not adequately protect the privacy of personal information could inhibit sales of our products or services and could constrain consumer and business adoption of our cloudbased solutions 

we may experience outages data losses and disruptions of our online services if we fail to maintain an adequate operations infrastructure our increasing user traffic and the complexity of our products and services demand more computing power we have spent and expect to continue to spend substantial amounts to purchase or lease data centers and equipment and to upgrade our technology and network infrastructure to handle more traffic on our websites and in our data centers and to introduce new products and services and support existing services such as bing exchange online office 365 sharepoint online skydrive skype xbox live windows azure outlookcom and microsoft office web apps we also are growing our business of providing a platform and backend hosting for services provided by thirdparty businesses to their end customers maintaining and expanding this infrastructure is expensive and complex inefficiencies or operational failures including temporary or permanent loss of customer data could diminish the quality of our products services and user experience resulting in contractual liability claims by customers and other third parties damage to our reputation and loss of current and potential users subscribers and advertisers each of which may harm our operating results and financial condition 

we are subject to government litigation and regulatory activity that may limit how we design and market our products as a leading global software maker we are closely scrutinized by government agencies under us and foreign competition laws some jurisdictions also provide private rights of action for competitors or consumers to assert claims of anticompetitive conduct for example we were sued on competition law grounds by the us department of justice 18 states and the district of columbia in the late 1990s the resolution of the government lawsuits imposed various constraints on our windows operating system businesses although these constraints expired in may 2011 we expect that federal and state antitrust authorities will continue to closely scrutinize our business 

  

  

part i 

item 1a 

  

the european commission closely scrutinizes the design of highvolume microsoft products and the terms on which we make certain technologies used in these products such as file formats programming interfaces and protocols available to other companies in 2004 the commission ordered us to create new versions of windows that do not include certain multimedia technologies and to provide our competitors with specifications for how to implement certain proprietary windows communications protocols in their own products in 2009 the commission accepted a set of commitments offered by microsoft to address the commission’s concerns relating to competition in web browsing software including an undertaking to address commission concerns relating to interoperability these obligations may limit our ability to innovate in windows or other products in the future diminish the developer appeal of the windows platform and increase our product development costs the availability of licenses related to protocols and file formats may enable competitors to develop software products that better mimic the functionality of our products which could hamper sales of our products 

government regulatory actions and court decisions such as these may hinder our ability to provide the benefits of our software to consumers and businesses thereby reducing the attractiveness of our products and the revenue that come from them new competition law actions could be initiated at any time the outcome of such actions or steps taken to avoid them could adversely affect us in a variety of ways including 

 

  

  

  

 our products and online services offerings including new technologies we develop or acquire such as skype are subject to government regulation in some jurisdictions including in areas of user privacy telecommunications data protection and online content the application of these laws and regulations to our business is often unclear subject to change over time and sometimes may conflict from jurisdiction to jurisdiction additionally these laws and governments’ approach to their enforcement as well as our products and services are continuing to evolve compliance with these types of regulation may involve significant costs or require changes in products or business practices that result in reduced revenue noncompliance could result in penalties being imposed on us or orders that we stop the alleged noncompliant activity 

our business depends on our ability to attract and retain talented employees our business is based on successfully attracting and retaining talented employees the market for highly skilled workers and leaders in our industry is extremely competitive we are limited in our ability to recruit internationally by restrictive domestic immigration laws if we are less successful in our recruiting efforts or if we are unable to retain key employees our ability to develop and deliver successful products and services may be adversely affected effective succession planning is also important to our longterm success failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution 

delays in product development schedules may adversely affect our revenue the development of software products is a complex and timeconsuming process new products and enhancements to existing products can require long development and testing periods our increasing focus on devices and cloudbased services also presents new and complex development issues significant delays in new product or service releases or significant problems in creating new products or services could adversely affect our revenue

adverse economic or market conditions may harm our business unfavorable changes in economic conditions including inflation recession or other changes in economic conditions may result in lower it spending and adversely affect our revenue if demand for pcs servers and other computing devices declines or consumer or business spending for those products declines our revenue will be adversely affected our product distribution system also relies on an extensive partner and retail network oems building devices that run our software have also been a significant means of distribution the impact of economic conditions on our partners such as the bankruptcy of a major distributor oem or retailer could result in sales channel disruption challenging economic conditions also may impair the ability of our customers to pay for products and services they have purchased as a result allowances for doubtful accounts and writeoffs of accounts receivable may increase we maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings types and maturities these investments are subject to general credit liquidity market and interest rate risks which may be exacerbated by unusual events that affect global financial markets a significant part of our investment portfolio consists of us government securities if global credit and equity markets experience prolonged periods of decline or if there is a downgrade of us government debt our investment portfolio may be adversely impacted and we could determine that more of our investments have experienced an otherthantemporary decline in fair value requiring impairment charges that could adversely affect our financial results 

we have claims and lawsuits against us that may result in adverse outcomes we are subject to a variety of claims and lawsuits adverse outcomes in some or all of these claims may result in significant monetary damages or injunctive relief that could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business the litigation and other claims are subject to inherent uncertainties and management’s view of these matters may change in the future a material adverse impact on our financial statements also could occur for the period in which the effect of an unfavorable final outcome becomes probable and reasonably estimable 

we may have additional tax liabilities we are subject to income taxes in the us and many foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes in the ordinary course of our business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain we regularly are under audit by tax authorities economic and political pressures to increase tax revenues in various jurisdictions may make resolving tax disputes more difficult although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals the results of an audit or litigation could have a material effect on our financial statements in the period or periods for which that determination is made 

we earn a significant amount of our operating income from outside the us and any repatriation of funds currently held in foreign jurisdictions to the us may result in higher effective tax rates for the company in addition there have been proposals from congress to change us tax laws that would significantly impact how us multinational corporations are taxed on foreign earnings although we cannot predict whether or in what form any proposed legislation may pass if enacted it could have a material adverse impact on our tax expense and cash flows 

our hardware and software products may experience quality or supply problems our verticallyintegrated hardware products such as the xbox 360 console surface and other hardware devices we design and market are highly complex and can have defects in design manufacture or associated software we could incur significant expenses lost revenue and reputational harm if we fail to detect or effectively address such issues through design testing or warranty repairs we obtain some components of our hardware devices from sole suppliers our competitors use some of the same suppliers and their demand for hardware components can affect the amount of capacity available to us if a component delivery from a solesource supplier is delayed or becomes unavailable or industry shortages occur we may be unable to obtain timely replacement supplies resulting in reduced sales component shortages excess or obsolete inventory or price reductions resulting in inventory adjustments may increase our cost of revenue xbox 360 consoles and surface are assembled in asia disruptions in the supply chain may result in shortages that would affect our revenue and operating margins these same risks would apply to any other verticallyintegrated hardware and software products we may offer 

our standalone software products also may experience quality or reliability problems the highly sophisticated software products we develop may contain bugs and other defects that interfere with their intended operation any defects we do not detect and fix in prerelease testing could result in reduced sales and revenue damage to our

if our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets become impaired we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings we acquire other companies and intangible assets and may not realize all the economic benefit from those acquisitions which could result in an impairment of goodwill or intangibles under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states we review our amortizable intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable we test goodwill for impairment at least annually factors that may be considered a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets may not be recoverable include a decline in stock price and market capitalization reduced future cash flow estimates and slower growth rates in our industry we may be required to record a significant charge in our financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets is determined negatively impacting our results of operations for example in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2012 we recorded a 62 billion charge for the impairment of goodwill in our online services division business segment 

we operate a global business that exposes us to additional risks we operate in over 100 countries and a significant part of our revenue comes from international sales competitive or regulatory pressure to make our pricing structure uniform might require that we reduce the sales price of our software in the us and other countries operations outside the us may be affected by changes in trade protection laws policies and measures and other regulatory requirements affecting trade and investment the foreign corrupt practices act and local laws “anticorruption laws” prohibit corrupt payments by our employees vendors or agents while we devote substantial resources to our global compliance programs and have implemented certain policies training and internal controls designed to reduce the risk of corrupt payments if we fail to comply with anticorruption laws we may be exposed to significant fines and penalties emerging markets are a significant focus of our international growth strategy the developing nature of these markets presents a number of risks deterioration of social political labor or economic conditions in a specific country or region such as current uncertainties relating to european economic weakness and difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations may also adversely affect our operations or financial results although we hedge a portion of our international currency exposure significant fluctuations in exchange rates between the us dollar and foreign currencies may adversely affect our revenue 

catastrophic events or geopolitical conditions may disrupt our business a disruption or failure of our systems or operations because of a major earthquake weather event cyberattack terrorist attack or other catastrophic event could cause delays in completing sales providing services or performing other missioncritical functions our corporate headquarters a significant portion of our research and development activities and certain other critical business operations are located in the seattle washington area and we have other business operations in the silicon valley area of california both of which are near major earthquake faults a catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our critical business or it systems could harm our ability to conduct normal business operations our move toward providing our customers with more services and solutions in the cloud puts a premium on the resilience of our systems and strength of our business continuity management plans and magnifies the potential impact of prolonged service outages on our operating results abrupt political change terrorist activity and armed conflict pose a risk of general economic disruption in affected countries which may increase our operating costs these conditions also may add uncertainty to the timing and budget for technology investment decisions by our customers and may result in supply chain disruptions for hardware manufacturers either of which may adversely affect our revenue the longterm effects of climate change on the global economy in general or the it industry in particular are unclear environmental regulations or changes in the supply demand or available sources of energy may affect the availability or cost of goods and services including natural resources necessary to run our business changes in weather where we operate may increase the costs of powering and cooling computer hardware we use to develop software and provide cloudbased services

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

the following management’s discussion and analysis “mda” is intended to help the reader understand the results of operations and financial condition of microsoft corporation mda is provided as a supplement to and should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the accompanying notes to financial statements 

overview 

microsoft is a technology leader focused on helping people and businesses throughout the world realize their full potential we create technology that transforms the way people work play and communicate across a wide range of computing devices 

  

  

part ii 

item 7 

  

we generate revenue by developing licensing and supporting a wide range of software products by offering an array of services including cloudbased services to consumers and businesses by designing and selling devices that integrate with our cloudbased services and by delivering relevant online advertising to a global audience our most significant expenses are related to compensating employees designing manufacturing marketing and selling our products and services and income taxes 

industry trends 

our industry is dynamic and highly competitive with frequent changes in both technologies and business models each industry shift is an opportunity to conceive new products new technologies or new ideas that can further transform the industry and our business at microsoft we push the boundaries of what is possible through a broad range of research and development activities that seek to identify and address the changing demands of customers industry trends and competitive forces 

key opportunities and investments 

based on our assessment of key technology trends and our broad focus on longterm research and development of new products and services we see significant opportunities to generate future growth 

we invest research and development resources in new products and services in these areas the capabilities and accessibility of pcs tablets phones televisions and other devices powered by rich software platforms and applications continue to grow with this trend we believe the full potential of software will be seen and felt in how people use these devices and the associated services at work and in their personal lives 

devices with enduser services 

we work with an ecosystem of partners to deliver a broad spectrum of windows devices in some cases we build our own devices as we have chosen to do with xbox and surface in all our work with partners and on our own devices we focus on delivering seamless services and experiences across devices as consumer services and hardware advance we expect they will continue to better complement one another connecting the devices people use daily to unique communications productivity and entertainment services from microsoft and our partners and developers around the world 

windows 8 reflects this shift launched in october 2012 windows 8 was designed to unite the light thin and convenient aspects of a tablet with the power of a pc the windows 8 operating system includes the windows store which offers a large and growing number of applications from microsoft and partners for both business and consumer customers 

going forward our strategy will focus on creating a family of devices and services for individuals and businesses that empower people around the globe at home at work and on the go for the activities they value most this strategy will require investment in datacenters and other infrastructure to support our services and will bring continued competition with apple google and other wellestablished and emerging competitors we believe our history of powering devices such as windows pcs and xbox as well as our experience delivering highvalue experiences through office and other applications will position us for future success 

services for the enterprise 

today businesses face important opportunities and challenges enterprises are asked to deploy technology that drives business strategy forward they decide what solutions will make employees more productive collaborative and satisfied or connect with customers in new and compelling ways they work to unlock business insights from a world of data at the same time they must manage and secure corporate information that employees access across a growing number of personal and corporate devices 

  

  

part ii 

item 7 

  

to address these opportunities businesses look to our worldclass business applications like microsoft dynamics office exchange sharepoint lync yammer and our business intelligence solutions they rely on our technology to manage employee corporate identity and to protect their corporate data and increasingly businesses of all sizes are looking to microsoft to realize the benefits of the cloud 

helping businesses move to the cloud is one of our largest opportunities cloudbased solutions provide customers with software services and content over the internet by way of shared computing resources located in centralized data centers the shift to the cloud is driven by three important economies of scale larger data centers can deploy computational resources at significantly lower cost per unit than smaller ones larger data centers can coordinate and aggregate diverse customer geographic and application demand patterns improving the utilization of computing storage and network resources and multitenancy lowers application maintenance labor costs for large public clouds because of the improved economics the cloud offers unique levels of elasticity and agility that enable new solutions and applications for businesses of all sizes the cloud creates the opportunity to focus on innovation while leaving nondifferentiating activities to reliable and costeffective providers 

unique to microsoft we continue to design and deliver cloud solutions that allow our customers to use both the cloud and their onpremise assets however best suits their own needs for example a company can choose to deploy office or microsoft dynamics on premise as a cloud service or a combination of both with windows server 2012 windows azure and system center infrastructure businesses can deploy applications in their own datacenter a partner’s datacenter or in microsoft’s datacenter with common security management and administration across all environments with the flexibility and scale they desire these hybrid capabilities allow customers to fully harness the power of the cloud so they can achieve greater levels of efficiency and tap new areas of growth 

our future opportunity 

there are several distinct areas of technology that we are focused on driving forward our goal is to lead the industry in these areas over the longterm which we expect will translate to sustained growth well into the future we are investing significant resources in 

 

  

  

  

  

 we believe the breadth of our devices and services portfolio our large global partner and customer base and the growing windows ecosystem position us to be a leader in these areas 

economic conditions challenges and risks 

the market for software devices and cloudbased services is dynamic and highly competitive some of our traditional businesses such as the windows operating system are in a period of transition our competitors are developing new devices and deploy competing cloudbased services for consumers and businesses the devices and form factors customers prefer evolve rapidly and influence how users access services in the cloud and in some cases the user’s choice of which suite of cloudbased services to use the windows ecosystem must continue to evolve and adapt over an extended time in pace with this changing environment to support our strategy of offering 

  

  

part ii 

item 7 

  

a family of devices and services designed to empower our customers for the activities they value most we announced a functional realignment in july 2013 through this realignment our goal is to become more nimble collaborative communicative motivated and decisive even if we achieve these benefits the investments we are making in devices and infrastructure to support our cloudbased services will increase our operating costs and may decrease our operation margins 

we prioritize our investments among the highest longterm growth opportunities these investments require significant resources and are multiyear in nature the products and services we bring to market may be developed internally as part of a partnership or alliance or through acquisition 

our success is highly dependent on our ability to attract and retain qualified employees we hire a mix of university and industry talent worldwide microsoft competes for talented individuals worldwide by offering broad customer reach scale in resources and competitive compensation 

aggregate demand for our software services and hardware is correlated to global macroeconomic factors which remain dynamic see a discussion of these factors and other risks under risk factors part i item 1a of this form 10k 

seasonality 

our revenue historically has fluctuated quarterly and has generally been highest in the second quarter of our fiscal year due to corporate calendar yearend spending trends in our major markets and holiday season spending by consumers our entertainment and devices division is particularly seasonal as its products are aimed at the consumer market and are in highest demand during the holiday shopping season typically the entertainment and devices division has generated approximately 40 of its yearly revenue in our second fiscal quarter 

unearned revenue 

quarterly and annual revenue may be impacted by the deferral of revenue see the discussions below regarding revenue deferred on sales of windows 7 with an option to upgrade to windows 8 pro at a discounted price the “windows upgrade offer” and sales of the previous version of the microsoft office system with a guarantee to be upgraded to the new office at minimal or no cost the “office upgrade offer” for the offer relating to the new office and “the 2010 office upgrade offer” for the prior offer relating to office 2010 

if our customers elect to license cloudbased versions of our products and services rather than licensing transactionbased products and services the associated revenue will shift from being recognized at the time of the transaction to being recognized over the subscription period or upon consumption as applicable 

results of operations 

summary 

 

 fiscal year 2013 compared with fiscal year 2012 

revenue increased primarily due to higher revenue from server and tools as well as revenue from new products and services including windows 8 surface and the new office offset in part by the impact on revenue of a decline in the x86 pc market

income taxes 

fiscal year 2013 compared with fiscal year 2012 

our effective tax rate for fiscal years 2013 and 2012 was approximately 19 and 24 respectively our effective tax rate was lower than the us federal statutory rate primarily due to earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting from producing and distributing our products and services through our foreign regional operations centers in ireland singapore and puerto rico 

our fiscal year 2013 effective rate decreased by 5 from fiscal year 2012 mainly due to a nonrecurring 62 billion nontax deductible goodwill impairment charge that was recorded in fiscal year 2012 the goodwill impairment charge increased our effective tax rate by 10 in fiscal year 2012 in addition in fiscal years 2013 and 2012 we recognized a reduction of 18 and 21 respectively to the effective tax rate due to foreign earnings taxed at lower rates the decrease in our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2013 was primarily offset by a 1 increase related to the eu fine which is not tax deductible 

changes in the mix of income before income taxes between the us and foreign countries also impacted our effective tax rates and resulted primarily from changes in the geographic distribution of and changes in consumer demand for our products and services as discussed above windows division operating income declined 21 billion in fiscal year 2013 while mbd and server and tools operating income increased 362 million and 929 million respectively during this same period we supply windows our primary windows division product to customers through our us regional operating center while we supply the microsoft office system our primary mbd product and our server and tools products to customers through our foreign regional operations centers in fiscal years 2013 and 2012 our us income before income taxes was 67 billion and 16 billion respectively and comprised 25 and 7 respectively of our income before income taxes in fiscal years 2013 and 2012 the foreign income before income taxes was 204 billion and 207 billion respectively and comprised 75 and 93 respectively of our income before income taxes the primary driver for the increase in the us income before income tax in fiscal year 2013 was the goodwill impairment charge recorded during the prior year 

tax contingencies and other tax liabilities were 94 billion and 76 billion as of june 30 2013 and 2012 respectively and are included in other longterm liabilities this increase relates primarily to transfer pricing including transfer pricing developments in certain foreign tax jurisdictions primarily denmark while we settled a portion of the irs audit for tax years 2004 to 2006 during the third quarter of fiscal year 2011 we remain under audit for those years in february 2012 the irs withdrew its 2011 revenue agents report and reopened the audit phase of the examination as of june 30 2013 the primary unresolved issue relates to transfer pricing which could have a significant impact on our financial statements if not resolved favorably we do not believe it is reasonably possible that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits will significantly increase or decrease within the next 12 months because we do not believe the remaining open issues will be resolved within the next 12 months we also continue to be subject to examination by the irs for tax years 2007 to 2012 

we are subject to income tax in many jurisdictions outside the us our operations in certain jurisdictions remain subject to examination for tax years 1996 to 2012 some of which are currently under audit by local tax authorities the resolutions of these audits are not expected to be material to our financial statements 

fiscal year 2012 compared with fiscal year 2011 

our effective tax rates for fiscal years 2012 and 2011 were approximately 24 and 18 respectively our effective tax rates were lower than the us federal statutory rate primarily due to earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting from producing and distributing our products and services through our foreign regional operations centers in ireland singapore and puerto rico 

our fiscal year 2012 effective rate increased by 6 from fiscal year 2011 mainly due to a nonrecurring 62 billion nontax deductible goodwill impairment charge that was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2012 the goodwill impairment charge increased our effective tax rate by 10 in addition in fiscal years 2012 and 2011 we recognized

valuation 

in general and where applicable we use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities to determine the fair value of our financial instruments this pricing methodology applies to our level 1 investments such as exchangetraded mutual funds domestic and international equities and us government securities if quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities are not available to determine fair value then we use quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities or inputs other than the quoted prices that are observable either directly or indirectly this pricing methodology applies to our level 2 investments such as corporate notes and bonds foreign government bonds mortgagebacked securities and us agency securities level 3 investments are valued using internally developed models with unobservable inputs assets and liabilities measured using unobservable inputs are an immaterial portion of our portfolio 

a majority of our investments are priced by pricing vendors and are generally level 1 or level 2 investments as these vendors either provide a quoted market price in an active market or use observable inputs for their pricing without applying significant adjustments broker pricing is used mainly when a quoted price is not available the investment is not priced by our pricing vendors or when a broker price is more reflective of fair values in the market in which the investment trades our brokerpriced investments are generally classified as level 2 investments because the broker prices these investments based on similar assets without applying significant adjustments in addition all of our brokerpriced investments have a sufficient level of trading volume to demonstrate that the fair values used are appropriate for these investments our fair value processes include controls that are designed to ensure appropriate fair values are recorded these controls include model validation review of key model inputs analysis of periodoverperiod fluctuations and independent recalculation of prices where appropriate

in june 2013 we established a commercial paper program for the issuance and sale of up to 13 billion in commercial paper as of june 30 2013 we have not issued any commercial paper under this program 

in june 2013 we entered into a 13 billion credit facility which will serve as a backup for our commercial paper program as of june 30 2013 we were in compliance with the only financial covenant in the credit agreement which requires us to maintain a coverage ratio of at least three times earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization to interest expense as defined in the credit agreement the credit facility expires on june 24 2018 no amounts were drawn against the credit facility since its inception 

unearned revenue

 offbalance sheet arrangements 

we provide indemnifications of varying scope and size to certain customers against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products and certain other matters in evaluating estimated losses on these indemnifications we consider factors such as the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and our ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss these obligations did not have a material impact on our financial statements during the periods presented

 other planned uses of capital 

we will continue to invest in sales marketing product support infrastructure and existing and advanced areas of technology additions to property and equipment will continue including new facilities data centers and computer systems for research and development sales and marketing support and administrative staff we expect capital expenditures to increase in coming years in support of our cloud and devices strategy we have operating leases for most us and international sales and support offices and certain equipment we have not engaged in any related party transactions or arrangements with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect liquidity or the availability of capital resources 

liquidity 

we earn a significant amount of our operating income outside the us which is deemed to be permanently reinvested in foreign jurisdictions as a result as discussed above under cash cash equivalents and investments the majority of our cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments are held by foreign subsidiaries we currently do not intend nor foresee a need to repatriate these funds we expect existing domestic cash cash equivalents shortterm investments and cash flows from operations to continue to be sufficient to fund our domestic operating activities and cash commitments for investing and financing activities such as regular quarterly dividends debt repayment schedules and material capital expenditures for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future in addition we expect existing foreign cash cash equivalents shortterm investments and cash flows from operations to continue to be sufficient to fund our foreign operating activities and cash commitments for investing activities such as material capital expenditures for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future 

should we require more capital in the us than is generated by our operations domestically for example to fund significant discretionary activities such as business acquisitions and share repurchases we could elect to repatriate future earnings from foreign jurisdictions or raise capital in the us through debt or equity issuances these alternatives could result in higher effective tax rates increased interest expense or dilution of our earnings we have borrowed funds domestically and continue to believe we have the ability to do so at reasonable interest rates 

recent accounting guidance 

recently adopted accounting guidance 

in september 2011 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued guidance on testing goodwill for impairment the new guidance provides an entity the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount if an entity determines that this is the case it is required to perform the twostep goodwill impairment test to identify potential goodwill impairment and measure the amount of goodwill impairment loss to be recognized for that reporting unit if any if an entity determines that the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount the twostep goodwill impairment test is not required we adopted this new guidance beginning july 1 2012 adoption of this new guidance did not have a material impact on our financial statements 

in june 2011 the fasb issued guidance on presentation of comprehensive income the new guidance eliminated the option to report other comprehensive income “oci” and its components in the statement of changes in stockholders’ equity instead an entity is required to present either a continuous statement of net income and oci or in two separate but consecutive statements we adopted this new guidance beginning july 1 2012 adoption of this new guidance resulted only in changes to presentation of our financial statements

recent accounting guidance not yet adopted 

in december 2011 the fasb issued guidance enhancing disclosure requirements about the nature of an entity’s right to offset and related arrangements associated with its financial instruments and derivative instruments the new guidance requires the disclosure of the gross amounts subject to rights of setoff amounts offset in accordance with the accounting standards followed and the related net exposure in january 2013 the fasb clarified that the scope of this guidance applies to derivatives including bifurcated embedded derivatives repurchase agreements and reverse repurchase agreements and securities borrowing and securities lending transactions that are either offset or subject to an enforceable master netting arrangement or similar agreements the new guidance will be effective for us beginning july 1 2013 other than requiring additional disclosures we do not anticipate material impacts on our financial statements upon adoption 

in february 2013 the fasb issued guidance on disclosure requirements for items reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income “aoci” this new guidance requires entities to present either on the face of the income statement or in the notes the effects on the line items of the income statement for amounts reclassified out of aoci the new guidance will be effective for us beginning july 1 2013 other than requiring additional disclosures we do not anticipate material impacts on our financial statements upon adoption 

in march 2013 the fasb issued guidance on a parent’s accounting for the cumulative translation adjustment upon derecognition of a subsidiary or group of assets within a foreign entity this new guidance requires that the parent release any related cumulative translation adjustment into net income only if the sale or transfer results in the complete or substantially complete liquidation of the foreign entity in which the subsidiary or group of assets had resided the new guidance will be effective for us beginning july 1 2014 we do not anticipate material impacts on our financial statements upon adoption 

application of critical accounting policies 

our financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with us gaap preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses these estimates and assumptions are affected by management’s application of accounting policies critical accounting policies for us include revenue recognition impairment of investment securities goodwill research and development costs contingencies income taxes and inventories 

revenue recognition 

revenue recognition requires judgment including whether a software arrangement includes multiple elements and if so whether the vendorspecific objective evidence “vsoe” of fair value exists for those elements a portion of revenue may be recorded as unearned due to undelivered elements changes to the elements in a software arrangement the ability to identify the vsoe for those elements and the fair value of the respective elements could materially impact the amount of earned and unearned revenue judgment is also required to assess whether future releases of certain software represent new products or upgrades and enhancements to existing products certain volume licensing arrangements include a perpetual license for current products combined with rights to receive unspecified future versions of software products “software assurance” and are accounted for as subscriptions with billings recorded as unearned revenue and recognized as revenue ratably over the coverage period 

software updates are evaluated on a casebycase basis to determine whether they meet the definition of an upgrade which may require revenue to be deferred and recognized when the upgrade is delivered or if it is determined that implied postcontract customer support “pcs” is being provided revenue from the arrangement is deferred and recognized over the implied pcs term if updates are determined to not meet the definition of an upgrade revenue is generally recognized as products are shipped or made available 

windows 81 will enable new hardware further the integration with other microsoft services and address customer issues with windows 8 and will be provided to windows 8 customers when available at no additional charge we evaluated windows 81 and determined that it did not meet the definition of an upgrade and thus have not deferred revenue related to this planned release 

  

  

part ii 

item 7 

  

windows 7 revenue was subject to deferral as a result of the windows upgrade offer which started june 2 2012 the offer provided significantly discounted rights to purchase windows 8 pro to qualifying endusers that purchased windows 7 pcs during the eligibility period microsoft was responsible for delivering windows 8 pro to the end customer accordingly revenue related to the allocated discount for undelivered windows 8 was deferred until it was delivered or the redemption period expired 

microsoft office system revenue was subject to deferral as a result of the office upgrade offer which started october 19 2012 the office upgrade offer allowed customers who purchased qualifying 2010 microsoft office system or office for mac 2011 products to receive at no cost a oneyear subscription to office 365 home premium or the equivalent version of 2013 microsoft office system upon general availability small business customers in applicable markets were also eligible for a threemonth trial of office 365 small business premium accordingly estimated revenue related to the undelivered 2013 microsoft office system and subscription services was deferred until the products and services were delivered or the redemption period expired 

impairment of investment securities 

we review investments quarterly for indicators of otherthantemporary impairment this determination requires significant judgment in making this judgment we employ a systematic methodology quarterly that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments if the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value we evaluate among other factors general market conditions credit quality of debt instrument issuers the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost and for equity securities our intent and ability to hold or plans to sell the investment for fixedincome securities we also evaluate whether we have plans to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery we also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the investee including industry and sector performance changes in technology and operational and financing cash flow factors once a decline in fair value is determined to be otherthantemporary an impairment charge is recorded to other income expense and a new cost basis in the investment is established if market industry andor investee conditions deteriorate we may incur future impairments 

goodwill 

we allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the business combination we evaluate our reporting units on an annual basis and if necessary reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level operating segment or one level below an operating segment on an annual basis may 1 for us and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value these events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate legal factors operating performance indicators competition or sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit 

application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment including the identification of reporting units assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units assignment of goodwill to reporting units and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit the fair value of each reporting unit is estimated using a discounted cash flow methodology this analysis requires significant judgments including estimation of future cash flows which is dependent on internal forecasts estimation of the longterm rate of growth for our business estimation of the useful life over which cash flows will occur and determination of our weighted average cost of capital 

the estimates used to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit change from year to year based on operating results market conditions and other factors changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and goodwill impairment for each reporting unit 

research and development costs 

costs incurred internally in researching and developing a computer software product are charged to expense until technological feasibility has been established for the product once technological feasibility is established all 

  

  

part ii 

item 7 

  

software costs are capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers judgment is required in determining when technological feasibility of a product is established we have determined that technological feasibility for our software products is reached after all highrisk development issues have been resolved through coding and testing generally this occurs shortly before the products are released to manufacturing the amortization of these costs is included in cost of revenue over the estimated life of the products 

legal and other contingencies 

the outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought against us are subject to significant uncertainty an estimated loss from a loss contingency such as a legal proceeding or claim is accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated disclosure of a contingency is required if there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss has been incurred in determining whether a loss should be accrued we evaluate among other factors the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss changes in these factors could materially impact our financial statements 

income taxes 

the objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity’s financial statements or tax returns we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement accounting literature also provides guidance on derecognition of income tax assets and liabilities classification of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities accounting for interest and penalties associated with tax positions and income tax disclosures judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our financial statements 

inventories 

inventories are stated at average cost subject to the lower of cost or market cost includes materials labor and manufacturing overhead related to the purchase and production of inventories we regularly review inventory quantities on hand future purchase commitments with our suppliers and the estimated utility of our inventory these reviews include analysis of demand forecasts product life cycle status product development plans current sales levels pricing strategy and component cost trends if our review indicates a reduction in utility below carrying value we reduce our inventory to a new cost basis through a charge to cost of revenue the determination of market value and the estimated volume of demand used in the lower of cost or market analysis require significant judgment

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

risks 

we are exposed to economic risk from foreign currency exchange rates interest rates credit risk equity prices and commodity prices a portion of these risks is hedged but they may impact our financial statements 

foreign currency 

certain forecasted transactions assets and liabilities are exposed to foreign currency risk we monitor our foreign currency exposures daily and use hedges where practicable to offset the risks and maximize the economic effectiveness of our foreign currency positions principal currencies hedged include the euro japanese yen british pound and canadian dollar 

interest rate 

our fixedincome portfolio is diversified across credit sectors and maturities consisting primarily of investmentgrade securities the credit risk and average maturity of the fixedincome portfolio is managed to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain global and domestic fixedincome indices in addition we use “to be announced” forward purchase commitments of mortgagebacked assets to gain exposure to agency and mortgagebacked securities 

equity 

our equity portfolio consists of global developed and emerging market securities that are subject to market price risk we manage the securities relative to certain global and domestic indices and expect their economic risk and return to correlate with these indices 

commodity 

we use broadbased commodity exposures to enhance portfolio returns and facilitate portfolio diversification our investment portfolio has exposure to a variety of commodities including precious metals energy and grain we manage these exposures relative to global commodity indices and expect their economic risk and return to correlate with these indices 

valueatrisk 

we use a valueatrisk “var” model to estimate and quantify our market risks var is the expected loss for a given confidence level in the fair value of our portfolio due to adverse market movements over a defined time horizon the var model is not intended to represent actual losses in fair value including determinations of otherthantemporary losses in fair value in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states “us gaap” but is used as a risk estimation and management tool the distribution of the potential changes in total market value of all holdings is computed based on the historical volatilities and correlations among foreign currency exchange rates interest rates equity prices and commodity prices assuming normal market conditions 

the var is calculated as the total loss that will not be exceeded at the 975 percentile confidence level or alternatively stated the losses could exceed the var in 25 out of 1000 cases several risk factors are not captured in the model including liquidity risk operational risk and legal risk

item 7a 

  

the following table sets forth the oneday var for substantially all of our positions as of june 30 2013 and 2012 and for the year ended june 30 2013 

 

 total oneday var for the combined risk categories was 350 million at june 30 2013 and 292 million at june 30 2012 the total var is 28 less at june 30 2013 and 26 less at june 30 2012 than the sum of the separate risk categories in the above table due to the diversification benefit of the combination of risks

microsoft business division 

microsoft business division “mbd” offerings consist of the microsoft office system comprising mainly office office 365 sharepoint exchange and lync and microsoft dynamics business solutions which may be delivered either on premise or as a cloudbased service the microsoft office system is designed to increase personal team and organization productivity through a range of programs services and software solutions and generates over 90 of mbd revenue growth in office depends on our ability to add value to the core office product set and to continue to expand our product offerings in other areas such as content management enterprise search collaboration unified communications and business intelligence microsoft dynamics products provide business solutions for financial management customer relationship management “crm” supply chain management and analytics applications for small and midsize businesses large organizations and divisions of global enterprises 

approximately 80 of mbd revenue is generated from sales to businesses which includes microsoft office system revenue generated through volume licensing agreements and microsoft dynamics revenue revenue from sales to businesses generally depends upon the number of information workers in a licensed enterprise and is therefore relatively independent of the number of pcs sold in a given year approximately 20 of mbd revenue is derived from sales to consumers which includes revenue from retail packaged product sales and oem revenue this revenue generally is affected by the level of pc shipments and by product launches

principal products and services xbox 360 gaming and entertainment console kinect for xbox 360 xbox 360 video games xbox 360 accessories xbox live skype and windows phone 

competition 

entertainment and devices businesses are highly competitive characterized by rapid product life cycles frequent introductions of new products and game titles and the development of new technologies the markets for our products are characterized by significant price competition and we anticipate continued pricing pressure from our competitors our competitors vary in size from very small companies with limited resources to very large diversified corporations with substantial financial and marketing resources we compete primarily on the basis of product quality and variety timing of product releases and effectiveness of distribution and marketing 

our xbox gaming and entertainment business competes with console platforms from nintendo and sony both of which have a large established base of customers the lifecycle for gaming and entertainment consoles averages five to 10 years we released xbox 360 our second generation console in november 2005 nintendo and sony released new versions of their game consoles in late 2006 we believe the success of gaming and entertainment consoles is determined by the availability of games for the console providing exclusive game content that gamers seek the computational power and reliability of the console and the ability to create new experiences via online services downloadable content and peripherals in addition to nintendo and sony our businesses compete with both apple and google in offering content products and services to the consumer we believe the xbox 360 entertainment platform is positioned well against competitive products and services based on significant innovation in hardware architecture user interface developer tools online gaming and entertainment services and continued strong exclusive content from our own game franchises as well as other digital content offerings 

windows phone faces competition primarily from apple google and research in motion skype competes primarily with apple and google which offer a selection of instant messaging voice and video communication products 

operations 

we have operations centers that support all operations in their regions including customer contract and order processing credit and collections information processing and vendor management and logistics the regional center in ireland supports the european middle eastern and african region the center in singapore supports the japan india greater china and asiapacific region and the centers in fargo north dakota fort lauderdale florida puerto rico redmond washington and reno nevada support latin america and north america in addition to the operations centers we also operate data centers throughout the americas europe and asia regions 

to serve the needs of customers around the world and to improve the quality and usability of products in international markets we localize many of our products to reflect local languages and conventions localizing a product may require modifying the user interface altering dialog boxes and translating text 

we contract most of our manufacturing activities for xbox 360 and related games kinect for xbox 360 various retail software packaged products surface devices and microsoft pc hardware to third parties our products may include some components that are available from only one or limited sources our xbox 360 console and kinect for xbox

360 include key components that are supplied by a single source the integrated central processing unitgraphics processing unit is purchased from ibm and the supporting embedded dynamic random access memory chips are purchased from taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company sole source suppliers also will produce key components of our surface devices we generally have the ability to use other manufacturers if the current vendor becomes unavailable or unable to meet our requirements we generally have multiple sources for raw materials supplies and components and are often able to acquire component parts and materials on a volume discount basis 

research and development 

during fiscal years 2012 2011 and 2010 research and development expense was 98 billion 90 billion and 87 billion respectively these amounts represented 13 13 and 14 respectively of revenue in each of those years we plan to continue to make significant investments in a broad range of research and development efforts 

product development and intellectual property 

we develop most of our software products and services internally internal development allows us to maintain competitive advantages that come from closer technical control over our products and services it also gives us the freedom to decide which modifications and enhancements are most important and when they should be implemented we strive to obtain information as early as possible about changing usage patterns and hardware advances that may affect software design before releasing new software platforms we provide application vendors with a range of resources and guidelines for development training and testing generally we also create product documentation internally 

we protect our intellectual property investments in a variety of ways we work actively in the us and internationally to ensure the enforcement of copyright trademark trade secret and other protections that apply to our software and hardware products services business plans and branding we are a leader among technology companies in pursuing patents and currently have a portfolio of over 31000 us and international patents issued and over 38000 pending while we employ much of our internally developed intellectual property exclusively in microsoft products and services we also engage in outbound and inbound licensing of specific patented technologies that are incorporated into licensees’ or microsoft’s products from time to time we enter into broader crosslicense agreements with other technology companies covering entire groups of patents we also purchase or license technology that we incorporate into our products or services 

while it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of our products and business methods we believe based upon past experience and industry practice such licenses generally could be obtained on commercially reasonable terms we believe our continuing research and product development are not materially dependent on any single license or other agreement with a third party relating to the development of our products 

investing in the future 

microsoft’s success is based on our ability to create new and compelling products services and experiences for our users initiate and embrace disruptive technology trends to enter new geographic and product markets and to drive broad adoption of our products and services we invest in a range of emerging technology trends and breakthroughs that we believe offer significant opportunities to deliver value to our customers and growth for the company we maintain our longterm commitment to research and development across a wide spectrum of technologies tools and platforms spanning communication and collaboration information access and organization entertainment business and ecommerce advertising and devices 

while our main research and development facilities are located in redmond washington we also operate research and development facilities in other parts of the us and around the world including canada china denmark estonia germany india ireland israel and the united kingdom this global approach helps us remain competitive in local markets and enables us to continue to attract top talent from across the world we generally fund research at

in addition to our main research and development operations we also operate microsoft research microsoft research is one of the world’s largest computer science research organizations and works in close collaboration with top universities around the world to advance the stateoftheart in computer science providing us a unique perspective on future technology trends 

based on our assessment of key technology trends and our broad focus on longterm research and development we see significant opportunities to drive future growth in smart connected devices cloud computing entertainment search communications and productivity 

distribution sales and marketing 

we market and distribute our products and services primarily through the following channels oem distributors and resellers and online 

oem 

we distribute software through oems that preinstall our software on new pcs servers smartphones and other intelligent devices that they sell to end customers the largest component of the oem business is the windows operating system preinstalled on pcs oems also sell hardware preinstalled with other microsoft products including server and embedded operating systems and applications such as our microsoft office suite in addition to these products we also market through oems software services such as our windows live essentials suite 

there are two broad categories of oems the largest oems many of which operate globally are referred to as “direct oems” as our relationship with them is managed through a direct agreement between microsoft and the manufacturer we have distribution agreements covering one or more of our products with virtually all of the multinational oems including acer asus dell fujitsu htc hewlettpackard lg lenovo nokia samsung sony toshiba and with many regional and local oems the second broad category of oems consists of lowervolume pc manufacturers also called “system builders” which source their microsoft software for preinstallation and local redistribution primarily through the microsoft distributor channel rather than through a direct agreement or relationship with microsoft some of the distributors in the microsoft distributor channel are global such as ingram micro and tech data but most operate at a local or regional level 

distributors and resellers 

many organizations that license our products and services through enterprise agreements transact directly with us with sales support from solution integrators independent software vendors web agencies and developers that advise organizations on licensing our products and services “enterprise software advisors” organizations also license our products and services indirectly primarily through large account resellers “lars” distributors valueadded resellers “vars” oems system builder channels and retailers although each type of reselling partner reaches organizations of all sizes lars are primarily engaged with large organizations distributors resell primarily to vars and vars typically reach smallsized and mediumsized organizations enterprise software advisors typically are also authorized as lars and operate as resellers for our other licensing programs such as the select plus and open licensing programs discussed under “licensing options” below some of our distributors include ingram micro and tech data and some of our largest resellers include cdw dell insight enterprises and software house international our microsoft dynamics software offerings are licensed to enterprises through a global network of channel partners providing vertical solutions and specialized services we distribute our retail packaged products primarily through independent nonexclusive distributors authorized replicators resellers and retail outlets including microsoft stores individual consumers obtain these products primarily through retail outlets such as walmart and dixons we have a network of field sales representatives and field support personnel that solicits orders from distributors and resellers and provides product training and sales support

licensing options 

we license software to organizations under arrangements that allow the enduser customer to acquire multiple licenses of products and services our arrangements for organizations to acquire multiple licenses of products and services are designed to provide them with a means of doing so without having to acquire separate packaged product through retail channels in delivering organizational licensing arrangements to the market we use different programs designed to provide flexibility for organizations of various sizes while these programs may differ in various parts of the world generally they include those discussed below 

open licensing 

designed primarily for smalltomedium organizations open programs allows customers to acquire perpetual or subscription licenses and at the customer’s election rights to future versions of software products over a specified time period two or three years depending on the open programs used the offering that conveys rights to future versions of certain software products over the contract period is called software assurance software assurance also provides support tools and training to help customers deploy and use software efficiently open programs has several variations to fit customers’ diverse way of purchasing under the open license program customers can acquire licenses only or licenses with software assurance they can also renew software assurance upon the expiration of existing volume licensing agreements 

select plus licensing 

designed primarily for mediumtolarge organizations the select plus program allows customers to acquire perpetual licenses and at the customer’s election software assurance over a specified time period generally three years or less similar to open programs the select plus program allows customers to acquire licenses only acquire licenses with software assurance or renew software assurance upon the expiration of existing volume licensing agreements online services are also available for purchase through the select plus program and subscriptions are generally structured with terms between one and three years 

services provider licensing 

the microsoft services provider license agreement “spla” is a program targeted to service providers and independent software vendors “isvs” allowing these partners to provide software services and hosted applications to their end customers agreements are generally structured with a threeyear term and partners are billed monthly based upon consumption

enterprise agreement licensing 

enterprise agreements are targeted at medium and large organizations that want to acquire licenses to online services andor software products along with software assurance for all or substantial parts of their enterprise enterprises can elect to either acquire perpetual licenses or under the enterprise subscription program can acquire nonperpetual subscription agreements for a specified time period generally three years online services are also available for purchase through the enterprise agreement and subscriptions are generally structured with three year terms 

customers 

our customers include individual consumers small and mediumsized organizations enterprises governmental institutions educational institutions internet service providers application developers and oems consumers and small and mediumsized organizations obtain our products primarily through distributors resellers and oems no sales to an individual customer accounted for more than 10 of fiscal year 2012 2011 or 2010 revenue our practice is to ship our products promptly upon receipt of purchase orders from customers consequently backlog is not significant

 item 1a risk factors 

our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties including those described below that could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations cash flows and the trading price of our common stock 

we face intense competition across all markets for our products and services which may lead to lower revenue or operating margins 

competition in the technology sector our competitors range in size from diversified global companies with significant research and development resources to small specialized firms whose narrower product lines may let them be more effective in deploying technical marketing and financial resources barriers to entry in our businesses generally are low and software products can be distributed broadly and quickly at relatively low cost many of the areas in which we compete evolve rapidly with changing and disruptive technologies shifting user needs and frequent introductions of new products and services our ability to remain competitive depends on our success in making innovative products that appeal to businesses and consumers 

competition among platforms ecosystems and devices an important element of our business model has been to create platformbased ecosystems on which many participants can build diverse solutions a wellestablished ecosystem creates beneficial network effects among users application developers and the platform provider that can accelerate growth establishing significant scale in the marketplace is necessary to achieve and maintain competitive margins the strategic importance of a vibrant ecosystem increases as we launch the windows 8 operating system surface devices and associated cloudbased services we face significant competition from firms that provide competing platforms applications and services

business model competition companies compete with us based on a growing variety of business models 

 

  

  

 the competitive pressures described above may result in decreased sales volumes price reductions andor increased operating costs such as for marketing and sales incentives this may lead to lower revenue gross margins and operating income 

our increasing focus on devices and services presents execution and competitive risks a growing part of our strategy involves cloudbased services used with smart client devices our competitors are rapidly developing and deploying cloudbased services for consumers and business customers pricing and delivery models are evolving devices and form factors influence how users access services in the cloud and in some cases the user’s choice of which suite of cloudbased services to use we are devoting significant resources to develop and deploy our own competing cloudbased software plus services strategies while we believe our expertise investments in infrastructure and the breadth of our cloudbased services provide us with a strong foundation to compete it is uncertain whether our strategies will attract the users or generate the revenue required to be successful in addition to software development costs we are incurring costs to build and maintain infrastructure to support cloud computing services these costs may reduce the operating margins we have previously achieved whether we are successful in this new business model depends on our execution in a number of areas including 

 

  

  

  

 we make significant investments in new products and services that may not be profitable we will continue to make significant investments in research development and marketing for existing products services and technologies including the windows operating system the microsoft office system bing windows phone windows server the windows store the windows azure services platform office 365 other cloudbased services offerings and the xbox 360 entertainment platform we will also continue to invest in new software and hardware products services and technologies such as the surface line of microsoftdesigned and manufactured devices announced in june 2012 investments in new technology are speculative commercial success depends on many factors including innovativeness developer support and effective distribution and marketing if customers do not perceive our latest offerings as providing significant new functionality or other value they may reduce their purchases of new software products or upgrades unfavorably impacting revenue we may not achieve significant revenue from new product and service investments for a number of years if at all moreover new products and services may not be profitable and even if they are profitable operating margins for new products and businesses may not be as high as the margins we have experienced historically

in fall 2012 we are launching windows 8 a major new release of our pc operating system that seeks to deliver a unique user experience through wellintegrated software hardware and services its success depends on a number of factors including the extent to which customers embrace its new user interface and functionality successfully coordinating with our oem partners in releasing a variety of hardware devices that take advantage of its features and attracting developers at scale to ensure a competitive array of quality applications we expect to incur substantial marketing costs in launching window 8 and associated services and devices which may reduce our operating margins 

we may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property rights protecting our global intellectual property rights and combating unlicensed copying and use of software and other intellectual property is difficult while piracy adversely affects us revenue the impact on revenue from outside the us is more significant particularly in countries where laws are less protective of intellectual property rights as a result our revenue in these markets may grow slower than the underlying pc market similarly the absence of harmonized patent laws makes it more difficult to ensure consistent respect for patent rights throughout the world we actively educate consumers about the benefits of licensing genuine products and obtaining indemnification benefits for intellectual property risks and we educate lawmakers about the advantages of a business climate where intellectual property rights are protected however continued educational and enforcement efforts may fail to enhance revenue reductions in the legal protection for software intellectual property rights could adversely affect revenue 

third parties may claim we infringe their intellectual property rights from time to time we receive notices from others claiming we infringe their intellectual property rights the number of these claims may grow because of constant technological change in the segments in which we compete the extensive patent coverage of existing technologies and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents to resolve these claims we may enter into royalty and licensing agreements on terms that are less favorable than currently available stop selling or redesign affected products or pay damages to satisfy indemnification commitments with our customers these outcomes may cause operating margins to decline in addition to money damages in some jurisdictions plaintiffs can seek injunctive relief that may limit or prevent importing marketing and selling our products that have infringing technologies in some countries such as germany an injunction can be issued before the parties have fully litigated the validity of the underlying patents we have made and expect to continue making significant expenditures to settle claims related to the use of technology and intellectual property rights and to procure intellectual property rights as part of our strategy to manage this risk 

we may not be able to protect our source code from copying if there is an unauthorized disclosure of source code source code the detailed program commands for our operating systems and other software programs is critical to our business although we license portions of our application and operating system source code to a number of licensees we take significant measures to protect the secrecy of large portions of our source code if an unauthorized disclosure of a significant portion of our source code occurs we could potentially lose future trade secret protection for that source code this could make it easier for third parties to compete with our products by copying functionality which could adversely affect our revenue and operating margins unauthorized disclosure of source code also could increase the security risks described in the next paragraph 

cyberattacks and security vulnerabilities could lead to reduced revenue increased costs liability claims or harm to our competitive position 

security of microsoft’s information technology maintaining the security of computers and computer networks is paramount for us and our customers threats to information technology “it” security can take a variety of forms hackers develop and deploy viruses worms and other malicious software programs that attack our products and services and gain access to our networks and data centers groups of hackers may also act in a coordinated manner to launch distributed denial of service attacks or other coordinated attacks sophisticated organizations or individuals may launch targeted attacks using novel methods to gain access to computers running our software these threats may result in breaches of our network or data security disruptions of our internal systems and business applications impairment of our ability to provide services to our customers product development delays harm to our competitive position from the compromise of confidential business information or other negative impacts on our business

in addition our internal it environment continues to evolve often we are early adopters of new devices and technologies we embrace new ways of sharing data and communicating internally and with partners and customers using methods such as social networking and other consumeroriented technologies these practices can enhance efficiency and business insight but they also present risks that our business policies and internal security controls may not keep pace with the speed of these changes 

security of our customers’ products and services  security threats are a particular challenge to companies like us whose business is technology products and services the threats to our own it infrastructure also affect our customers customers using our cloud services rely on the security of our infrastructure to ensure the reliability of our services and the protection of their data hackers tend to focus their efforts on the most popular operating systems programs and services including many of ours and we expect them to continue to do so the security of our products and services is an important consideration in our customers’ purchasing decisions 

we devote significant resources to defend against security threats both to our internal it systems and those of our customers these include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 the cost of these steps could reduce our operating margins despite these efforts actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products and services could cause significant reputational harm and lead some customers to reduce or delay future purchases of products or subscriptions to services or to use competing products customers may also increase their expenditures on protecting their existing computer systems from attack which could delay adoption of additional products or services any of these actions by customers could adversely affect our revenue actual or perceived vulnerabilities may lead to claims against us although our license agreements typically contain provisions that eliminate or limit our exposure to such liability there is no assurance these provisions will withstand all legal challenges legislative or regulatory action may increase the costs to develop or implement our products and services 

improper disclosure of personal data could result in liability and harm our reputation as we continue to execute our strategy of increasing the number and scale of our cloudbased offerings we store and process increasingly large amounts of personally identifiable information of our customers at the same time the continued occurrence of highprofile data breaches provides evidence of an external environment increasingly hostile to information security this environment demands that we continuously improve our design and coordination of security controls across our business groups and geographies despite these efforts it is possible our security controls over personal data our training of employees and vendors on data security and other practices we follow may not prevent the improper disclosure of personally identifiable information that we or our vendors store and manage improper disclosure of this information could harm our reputation lead to legal exposure to customers or subject us to liability under laws that protect personal data resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue our software products and services also enable our customers to store and process personal data on premise or increasingly in a cloudbased environment we host we believe consumers using our email messaging storage sharing and social networking services will increasingly want efficient centralized methods of choosing their privacy preferences and controlling their data perceptions that our products or services do not adequately protect the

privacy of personal information could inhibit sales of our products or services and could constrain consumer and business adoption of our cloudbased solutions 

we may experience outages data losses and disruptions of our online services if we fail to maintain an adequate operations infrastructure our increasing user traffic and complexity of our products and services demand more computing power we have spent and expect to continue to spend substantial amounts to purchase or lease data centers and equipment and to upgrade our technology and network infrastructure to handle increased traffic on our websites and in our data centers and to introduce new products and services and support existing services such as bing exchange online office 365 sharepoint online skype xbox live windows azure windows live and microsoft office web apps we also are growing our business of providing a platform and backend hosting for services provided by thirdparty businesses to their end customers maintaining and expanding this infrastructure is expensive and complex inefficiencies or operational failures including temporary or permanent loss of customer data could diminish the quality of our products services and user experience resulting in contractual liability claims by customers and other third parties damage to our reputation and loss of current and potential users subscribers and advertisers each of which may harm our operating results and financial condition 

we are subject to government litigation and regulatory activity that affects how we design and market our products as a leading global software maker we receive close scrutiny from government agencies under us and foreign competition laws some jurisdictions also provide private rights of action for competitors or consumers to assert claims of anticompetitive conduct for example we have been involved in the following actions 

lawsuits brought by the us department of justice 18 states and the district of columbia in two separate actions were resolved through a consent decree that took effect in 2001 and a final judgment entered in 2002 these proceedings imposed various constraints on our windows operating system businesses these constraints included limits on certain contracting practices mandated disclosure of certain software program interfaces and protocols and rights for computer manufacturers to limit the visibility of certain windows features in new pcs although the consent decree and final judgment expired in may 2011 we expect that federal and state antitrust authorities will continue to closely scrutinize our business 

the european commission closely scrutinizes the design of highvolume microsoft products and the terms on which we make certain technologies used in these products such as file formats programming interfaces and protocols available to other companies in 2004 the commission ordered us to create new versions of windows that do not include certain multimedia technologies and to provide our competitors with specifications for how to implement certain proprietary windows communications protocols in their own products in 2009 the commission accepted a set of commitments offered by microsoft to address the commission’s concerns relating to competition in web browsing software the commission’s impact on product design may limit our ability to innovate in windows or other products in the future diminish the developer appeal of the windows platform and increase our product development costs the availability of licenses related to protocols and file formats may enable competitors to develop software products that better mimic the functionality of our own products which could result in decreased sales of our products 

government regulatory actions and court decisions such as these may hinder our ability to provide the benefits of our software to consumers and businesses thereby reducing the attractiveness of our products and the revenue that come from them new actions could be initiated at any time either by these or other governments or private claimants including with respect to new versions of windows or other microsoft products the outcome of such actions or steps taken to avoid them could adversely affect us in a variety of ways including

 our products and online services offerings including new technologies we develop or acquire such as skype are subject to government regulation in some jurisdictions including in areas of user privacy telecommunications data protection and online content the application of these laws and regulations to our business is often unclear subject to change over time and sometimes may conflict from jurisdiction to jurisdiction additionally these laws and governments’ approach to their enforcement as well as our products and services are continuing to evolve compliance with these types of regulation may involve significant costs or require changes in products or business practices that result in reduced revenue noncompliance could result in penalties being imposed on us or orders that we stop the alleged noncompliant activity 

our business depends on our ability to attract and retain talented employees our business is based on successfully attracting and retaining talented employees the market for highly skilled workers and leaders in our industry is extremely competitive we are limited in our ability to recruit internationally by restrictive domestic immigration laws if we are less successful in our recruiting efforts or if we are unable to retain key employees our ability to develop and deliver successful products and services may be adversely affected effective succession planning is also important to our longterm success failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution 

delays in product development schedules may adversely affect our revenue the development of software products is a complex and timeconsuming process new products and enhancements to existing products can require long development and testing periods our increasing focus on cloudbased software plus services also presents new and complex development issues significant delays in new product or service releases or significant problems in creating new products or services could adversely affect our revenue 

we make significant investments in new products and services that may not be profitable our growth depends on our ability to create new and higher value product and service offerings we will continue to make significant investments in research development and marketing for existing products services and technologies including the windows pc operating system the microsoft office system bing windows phone windows server the windows store the windows azure services platform office 365 other cloudbased services offerings and the xbox 360 entertainment platform in june 2012 we announced the surface line of microsoftdesigned and manufactured devices we will also continue to invest in new software and hardware products services and technologies investments in new technology are speculative commercial success depends on many factors including innovativeness developer support and effective distribution and marketing our degree of success with windows phone for example will impact our ability to grow our share of the smartphone operating system market it will also be an important factor in supporting our strategy of delivering value to end users seamlessly over a variety of form factors including pc phone and tv device classes if customers do not perceive our latest offerings as providing significant new functionality or other value they may reduce their purchases of new software products or upgrades unfavorably impacting revenue we may not achieve significant revenue from new product and service investments for a number of years if at all moreover new products and services may not be profitable and even if they are profitable operating margins for new products and businesses may not be as high as the margins we have experienced historically 

adverse economic conditions may harm our business unfavorable changes in economic conditions including inflation recession or other changes in economic conditions may result in lower information technology spending and adversely affect our revenue if demand for pcs servers and other computing devices declines or consumer or business spending for those products declines our revenue will be adversely affected our product distribution system also relies on an extensive partner and retail network original equipment manufacturers “oems” building devices that run our software have also been a significant means of distribution the impact of economic conditions on our partners such as the bankruptcy of a major distributor oem or retailer could result in sales channel disruption challenging economic conditions also may impair the ability of our customers to pay for products and

services they have purchased as a result allowances for doubtful accounts and writeoffs of accounts receivable may increase we maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings types and maturities these investments are subject to general credit liquidity market and interest rate risks which may be exacerbated by unusual events that have affected global financial markets a significant part of our investment portfolio consists of us government securities if global credit and equity markets experience prolonged periods of decline or if there is a downgrade of us government debt our investment portfolio may be adversely impacted and we could determine that more of our investments have experienced an otherthantemporary decline in fair value requiring impairment charges that could adversely affect our financial results 

we have claims and lawsuits against us that may result in adverse outcomes we are subject to a variety of claims and lawsuits adverse outcomes in some or all of these claims may result in significant monetary damages or injunctive relief that could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business although management currently believes resolving all of these matters individually or in the aggregate will not have a material adverse impact on our financial statements the litigation and other claims are subject to inherent uncertainties and management’s view of these matters may change in the future a material adverse impact on our financial statements also could occur for the period in which the effect of an unfavorable final outcome becomes probable and reasonably estimable 

we may have additional tax liabilities we are subject to income taxes in the us and many foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes in the ordinary course of our business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain we regularly are under audit by tax authorities although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals the results of an audit or litigation could have a material effect on our financial statements in the period or periods for which that determination is made 

we earn a significant amount of our operating income from outside the us and any repatriation of funds currently held in foreign jurisdictions to the us may result in higher effective tax rates for the company in addition there have been proposals to change us tax laws that would significantly impact how us multinational corporations are taxed on foreign earnings although we cannot predict whether or in what form any proposed legislation may pass if enacted it could have a material adverse impact on our tax expense and cash flow 

our hardware and software products may experience quality or supply problems our verticallyintegrated hardware products such as the xbox 360 console surface devices and other hardware devices we design and market are highly complex and can have defects in design manufacture or associated software we could incur significant expenses lost revenue and reputational harm if we fail to detect or effectively address such issues through design testing or warranty repairs we obtain some components of our hardware devices from sole suppliers our competitors use some of the same suppliers and their demand for hardware components can affect the amount of capacity available to us if a component delivery from a solesource supplier is delayed or becomes unavailable or industry shortages occur we may be unable to obtain timely replacement supplies resulting in reduced sales either component shortages or excess or obsolete inventory may increase our cost of revenue xbox 360 consoles are assembled in asia disruptions in the supply chain may result in console shortages that would affect our revenue and operating margins these same risks would apply to any other verticallyintegrated hardware and software products we may offer 

our standalone software products may also experience quality or reliability problems the highly sophisticated software products we develop may contain bugs and other defects that interfere with their intended operation any defects we do not detect and fix in prerelease testing could result in reduced sales and revenue damage to our reputation repair or remediation costs delays in the release of new products or versions or legal liability although our license agreements typically contain provisions that eliminate or limit our exposure to liability there is no assurance these provisions will withstand legal challenge 

if our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets become impaired we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings we acquire other companies and may not realize all the economic benefit from those acquisitions which could result in an impairment of goodwill or intangibles under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states “us gaap” we review our amortizable intangible assets for impairment when 

  

  

part i 

item 1a 

  

events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable we test goodwill for impairment at least annually factors that may be considered a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets may not be recoverable include a decline in stock price and market capitalization reduced future cash flow estimates and slower growth rates in our industry we may be required to record a significant charge in our financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets is determined negatively impacting our results of operations for example in july 2012 we announced a 62 billion charge for the impairment of goodwill in our online services division business segment 

we operate a global business that exposes us to additional risks we operate in over 100 countries and a significant part of our revenue comes from international sales pressure to make our pricing structure uniform might require that we reduce the sales price of our software in the us and other countries operations outside the us may be affected by changes in trade protection laws policies and measures and other regulatory requirements affecting trade and investment including the foreign corrupt practices act and local laws prohibiting corrupt payments by our employees vendors or agents emerging markets are a significant focus of our international growth strategy the developing nature of these markets presents a number of risks deterioration of social political labor or economic conditions in a specific country or region such as current uncertainties relating to european sovereign and other debt and difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations may also adversely affect our operations or financial results although we hedge a portion of our international currency exposure significant fluctuations in exchange rates between the us dollar and foreign currencies may adversely affect our net revenue 

catastrophic events or geopolitical conditions may disrupt our business a disruption or failure of our systems or operations because of a major earthquake weather event cyberattack terrorist attack or other catastrophic event could cause delays in completing sales providing services or performing other missioncritical functions our corporate headquarters a significant portion of our research and development activities and certain other critical business operations are located in the seattle washington area and we have other business operations in the silicon valley area of california both of which are near major earthquake faults a catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our critical business or information technology systems could harm our ability to conduct normal business operations our move toward providing our customers with more services and solutions in the cloud puts a premium on the resilience of our systems and strength of our business continuity management plans and magnifies the potential impact of prolonged service outages on our operating results abrupt political change terrorist activity and armed conflict pose a risk of general economic disruption in affected countries which may increase our operating costs these conditions also may add uncertainty to the timing and budget for technology investment decisions by our customers and may result in supply chain disruptions for hardware manufacturers either of which may adversely affect our revenue the longterm effects of climate change on the global economy in general or the information technology industry in particular are unclear environmental regulations or changes in the supply demand or available sources of energy may affect the availability or cost of goods and services including natural resources necessary to run our business changes in weather where we operate may increase the costs of powering and cooling computer hardware we use to develop software and provide cloudbased services new regulations may require us to find alternative compliant and costeffective methods of distributing our products and services 

acquisitions joint ventures and strategic alliances may have an adverse effect on our business we expect to continue making acquisitions or entering into joint ventures and strategic alliances as part of our longterm business strategy these transactions involve significant challenges and risks including that the transaction does not advance our business strategy that we do not realize a satisfactory return on our investment or that we experience difficulty integrating new employees business systems and technology or diversion of management’s attention from our other businesses our recent acquisition of skype for example provides opportunities to enhance our existing products the success of our integration of skype will depend in part on our ability to provide compelling experiences that distinguish us from our competitors in both consumer and business markets it may take longer than expected to realize the full benefits from these transactions such as increased revenue enhanced efficiencies or market share or those benefits may ultimately be smaller than anticipated or may not be realized these events could harm our operating results or financial condition

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

the following management’s discussion and analysis “mda” is intended to help the reader understand the results of operations and financial condition of microsoft corporation mda is provided as a supplement to and should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the accompanying notes to financial statements 

overview and outlook 

microsoft is a technology leader focused on helping people and businesses throughout the world realize their full potential we create technology that transforms the way people work play and communicate across a wide range of computing devices 

we generate revenue by developing licensing and supporting a wide range of software products and services including cloudbased services by designing and selling hardware and by delivering relevant online advertising to a global audience our most significant expenses are related to compensating employees designing manufacturing marketing and selling our products and services and income taxes 

industry trends 

our industry is dynamic and highly competitive with frequent changes in both technologies and business models each industry shift is an opportunity to conceive new products new technologies or new ideas that can further transform the industry and our business at microsoft we push the boundaries of what is possible through a broad range of research and development activities that seek to anticipate the changing demands of customers industry trends and competitive forces 

key opportunities and investments 

based on our assessment of key technology trends and our broad focus on longterm research and development of new products and services we see significant opportunities to drive future growth 

smart connected devices 

the price per unit of processing storage and networks continues to decline while at the same time devices increase in capability as a result the capabilities and accessibility of pcs tablets phones televisions and other devices powered by rich software platforms and applications continue to grow at the same time the information and services people use increasingly span multiple devices enabled by the adoption of cloud computing 

for example the delivery and quality of unified entertainment experiences across devices is undergoing dramatic evolution these rich media experiences include books magazines newspapers games movies music television and social interactions with family friends and colleagues at microsoft our approach is to simplify and increase the accessibility of these entertainment experiences to broaden market penetration of our software hardware and services 

additionally web content and social connections have increased tremendously as people spend more time online while discoverability and accessibility has been transforming from direct navigation and document links there is significant opportunity to deliver products and services that help users make faster better decisions and complete tasks more simply when using their devices our approach is to use machine learning to understand user intent and differentiate our products and services by focusing on the integration of speech visual social and other elements to simplify people’s interaction with the internet 

we invest significant resources in enabling and developing smart connected devices that offer a unified seamless experience across a common platform whether a pc windows phone xbox 360 or the newly announced surface 

  

  

part ii 

item 7 

  

devices our goal is to provide users with a consistent and compelling experience through a common user interface and our services such as skydrive xbox live bing skype and our windows azure cloud platform 

communications and productivity 

the ubiquity of computing and software tools has transformed personal and business productivity over the last decade microsoft redefined software productivity beyond the rich office client on the pc productivity scenarios now encompass unified communications such as instant messaging voice and video communications business intelligence collaboration content management and relationship management all of which are increasingly available through serverside applications these server applications can be hosted in the cloud by the customer a partner or by microsoft there are significant opportunities to bring to life productivity and communication scenarios across pcs mobile and other devices that connect to services we invest significant resources in our products and services that make this possible – dynamics exchange lync skype office office 365 sharepoint windows live and windows phone 

cloud computing transforming the data center and information technology 

cloudbased solutions provide customers with software services and content over the internet by way of shared computing resources located in centralized data centers computing is undergoing a longterm shift from clientserver to the cloud a shift similar in importance and impact to the transition from mainframe to clientserver the shift to the cloud is driven by three important economies of scale larger data centers can deploy computational resources at significantly lower cost per unit than smaller ones larger data centers can coordinate and aggregate diverse customer geographic and application demand patterns improving the utilization of computing storage and network resources and multitenancy lowers application maintenance labor costs for large public clouds because of the improved economics the cloud offers unique levels of elasticity and agility that enables new solutions and applications for businesses of all sizes the cloud creates the opportunity to focus on innovation while leaving nondifferentiating activities to reliable and costeffective providers we are devoting significant resources to developing cloud infrastructure platforms and applications including offerings such as microsoft dynamics online microsoft sql azure office 365 windows azure windows intune and windows server 

economic conditions challenges and risks 

as discussed above our industry is dynamic and highly competitive we must anticipate changes in technology and business models our model for growth is based on our ability to initiate and embrace disruptive technology trends to enter new markets both in terms of geographies and product areas and to drive broad adoption of the products and services we develop and market 

at microsoft we prioritize our investments among the highest longterm growth opportunities these investments require significant resources and are multiyear in nature the products and services we bring to market may be developed internally brought to market as part of a partnership or alliance or through acquisition 

our success is highly dependent on our ability to attract and retain qualified employees we hire a mix of university and industry talent worldwide microsoft competes for talented individuals worldwide by offering broad customer reach scale in resources and competitive compensation 

demand for our software services and hardware has a strong correlation to global macroeconomic factors the current macroeconomic factors remain dynamic see a discussion of these factors and other risks under risk factors part ii item 1a of this form 10k 

seasonality 

our revenue historically has fluctuated quarterly and has generally been the highest in the second quarter of our fiscal year due to corporate calendar yearend spending trends in our major markets and holiday season spending 

  

  

part ii 

item 7 

  

by consumers our entertainment and devices division is particularly seasonal as its products are aimed at the consumer market and are in highest demand during the holiday shopping season typically the entertainment and devices division has generated approximately 40 of its yearly segment revenue in our second fiscal quarter 

unearned revenue 

quarterly and annual revenue may be impacted by the deferral of revenue see the discussions below regarding sales of earlier versions of the microsoft office system with a guarantee to be upgraded to the newest version of the microsoft office system at minimal or no cost the “office deferral” sales of windows vista with a guarantee to be upgraded to windows 7 at minimal or no cost the “windows 7 deferral” and sales of windows 7 with an option to upgrade to windows 8 pro at a discounted price the “windows upgrade offer” 

results of operations 

summary 

 

 fiscal year 2012 compared with fiscal year 2011 

revenue increased primarily due to strong sales of server and tools products and services and the 2010 microsoft office system offset in part by the decline in windows operating system revenue primarily due to the deferral of 540 million of revenue relating to the windows upgrade offer revenue in fiscal year 2012 also included skype revenue from the date of acquisition 

operating income decreased reflecting a goodwill impairment charge of 62 billion related to our osd business segment other key changes in operating expenses were 

 

  

  

 headcountrelated expenses were higher across the company reflecting a 4 increase in headcount from june 30 2011 and changes in our employee compensation program 

diluted earnings per share were negatively impacted by the nontax deductible goodwill impairment charge which decreased diluted earnings per share by 073 prior year net income and diluted earnings per share reflected a partial settlement with the us internal revenue service “irs” and higher other income the partial settlement with the irs added 461 million to net income and 005 to diluted earnings per share in the prior year 

fiscal year 2011 compared with fiscal year 2010 

revenue increased primarily due to strong sales of the xbox 360 entertainment platform the 2010 microsoft office system and server and tools products offset in part by lower windows revenue revenue also increased due to

windows  windows live division 

 

 windows  windows live division “windows division” develops and markets pc operating systems related software and online services and pc hardware products this collection of software hardware and services is designed to simplify everyday tasks through seamless operations across the user’s hardware and software and efficient browsing capabilities windows division offerings consist of the windows operating system software and services through windows live and microsoft pc hardware products 

windows division revenue is largely correlated to the pc market worldwide as approximately 75 of total windows division revenue comes from windows operating system software purchased by original equipment manufacturers “oems” which they preinstall on equipment they sell the remaining approximately 25 of windows division revenue is generated by commercial and retail sales of windows and pc hardware products and online advertising from windows live

windows division operating income decreased due mainly to lower revenue and a 163 million or 10 increase in research and development expenses primarily associated with the windows 8 operating system 

fiscal year 2011 compared with fiscal year 2010 

windows division revenue reflected relative performance in pc market segments we estimate that sales of pcs to businesses grew approximately 11 this year and sales of pcs to consumers declined approximately 1 the decline in consumer pc sales included an approximately 32 decline in the sales of netbooks taken together the total pc market increased an estimated 2 to 4 revenue was negatively impacted by the effect of higher growth in emerging markets where average selling prices are lower relative to developed markets and by lower recognition of previously deferred windows xp revenue considering the impact of the windows 7 launch in the prior year including 273 million of revenue recognized related to the windows 7 deferral we estimate that windows division revenue was in line with the pc market 

windows division operating income decreased as a result of decreased revenue and higher sales and marketing expenses sales and marketing expenses increased 182 million or 6 reflecting increased advertising of windows and windows live 

server and tools 

 

 server and tools develops and markets technology and related services that enable information technology professionals and their systems to be more productive and efficient server and tools product and service offerings include windows server microsoft sql server windows azure visual studio system center products windows embedded device platforms and enterprise services enterprise services comprise premier product support services and microsoft consulting services we also offer developer tools training and certification approximately 55 of server and tools revenue comes primarily from multiyear volume licensing agreements approximately 25 is purchased through transactional volume licensing programs retail packaged product and licenses sold to oems and the remainder comes from enterprise services 

fiscal year 2012 compared with fiscal year 2011 

server and tools revenue increased in both product sales and enterprise services product revenue increased 14 billion or 11 driven primarily by growth in sql server windows server and system center reflecting continued adoption of the windows platform enterprise services revenue grew 595 million or 18 due to growth in both premier product support and consulting services 

server and tools operating income increased primarily due to revenue growth offset in part by higher costs of providing products and services and increased sales and marketing expenses cost of revenue increased 682 million or 22 primarily reflecting higher enterprise services headcountrelated costs sales and marketing expenses grew 155 million or 4 reflecting increased corporate marketing activities

online services division 

 

  

 online services division “osd” develops and markets information and content designed to help people simplify tasks and make more informed decisions online and that help advertisers connect with audiences osd offerings include bing msn adcenter and advertiser tools bing and msn generate revenue through the sale of search and display advertising accounting for nearly all of osd’s annual revenue 

fiscal year 2012 compared with fiscal year 2011 

online advertising revenue grew 306 million or 13 to 26 billion reflecting continued growth in search advertising revenue offset in part by decreased display advertising revenue search revenue grew due to increased revenue per search increased volumes reflecting general market growth and share gains in the us according to thirdparty sources bing organic us market share for the month of june 2012 was approximately 16 and grew 120 basis points year over year bingpowered us market share including yahoo properties was approximately 26 for the month of june 2012 down 100 basis points year over year 

osd’s fiscal year 2012 operating loss reflects a goodwill impairment charge of 62 billion which we recorded as a result of our annual goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter the noncash nontaxdeductible charge related mainly to goodwill acquired through our 2007 acquisition of aquantive inc while the search business has been improving our expectations for future growth and profitability for osd are lower than our previous estimates we do not expect this impairment charge to affect osd’s ongoing business or financial performance 

excluding the 62 billion goodwill impairment charge osd’s operating loss was reduced by higher revenue and lower sales and marketing expenses and cost of revenue sales and marketing expenses decreased 321 million or 29 due mainly to lower marketing spend cost of revenue decreased 213 million driven by lower yahoo reimbursement costs amortization and online operating costs 

fiscal year 2011 compared with fiscal year 2010 

osd revenue increased primarily as a result of growth in online advertising revenue online advertising revenue grew 351 million or 18 to 23 billion reflecting continued growth in search and display advertising revenue offset in part by decreased thirdparty advertising revenue search revenue grew due to increased volumes reflecting general market growth share gains in the us and our yahoo alliance offset in part by decreased revenue per search primarily related to challenges associated with optimizing the adcenter platform for the new mix and volume

 we use derivative instruments to manage risks related to foreign currencies equity prices interest rates and credit to enhance investment returns and to facilitate portfolio diversification gains and losses from changes in fair values of derivatives that are not designated as hedges are recognized in other income expense these are generally offset by unrealized gains and losses in the underlying securities in the investment portfolio and are recorded as a component of other comprehensive income 

fiscal year 2012 compared with fiscal year 2011 

dividends and interest income decreased due to lower yields on our fixedincome investments offset in part by higher average portfolio investment balances interest expense increased due to our increased issuance of debt in the prior year net recognized gains on investments increased primarily due to higher gains on sales of equity and fixedincome securities and a gain recognized on the partial sale of our facebook holding upon the initial public offering on may 18 2012 offset in part by higher otherthantemporary impairments otherthantemporary impairments were 298 million in fiscal year 2012 compared with 80 million in fiscal year 2011 net losses on derivatives increased due to losses on commodity and equity derivatives in the current fiscal year as compared with gains in the prior fiscal year offset in part by fewer losses on foreign exchange contracts in the current fiscal year as compared to the prior fiscal year changes in foreign currency remeasurements were primarily due to currency movements net of our hedging activities

item 7 

  

recognized gains on investments increased primarily due to higher gains on sales of equity securities offset in part by fewer gains on sales of fixedincome securities derivative losses decreased primarily due to higher gains on commodity derivatives offset in part by higher losses on currency contracts used to hedge foreign currency revenue 

income taxes 

fiscal year 2012 compared with fiscal year 2011 

our effective tax rates for fiscal years 2012 and 2011 were approximately 24 and 18 respectively our effective tax rates were lower than the us federal statutory rate primarily due to earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting from producing and distributing our products and services through our foreign regional operations centers in ireland singapore and puerto rico which have lower income tax rates 

our fiscal year 2012 effective rate increased by 6 from fiscal year 2011 mainly due to a nonrecurring 62 billion nontax deductible goodwill impairment charge that was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2012 the goodwill impairment charge increased our effective tax rate by 10 in addition in fiscal years 2012 and 2011 we recognized a reduction of 21 and 16 respectively to the effective tax rate due to foreign earnings taxed at lower rates in fiscal year 2011 we settled a portion of an irs audit of tax years 2004 to 2006 which reduced our income tax expense for fiscal year 2011 by 461 million and reduced the effective tax rate by 2 

changes in the mix of income before income taxes between the us and foreign countries also impacted our effective tax rates and resulted primarily from changes in the geographic distribution of and changes in consumer demand for our products and services as discussed above windows division operating income declined 751 million in fiscal year 2012 while mbd and server and tools operating income increased 11 billion and 11 billion respectively during this same period we supply windows our primary windows division product to customers through our us regional operating center while we supply the microsoft office system our primary mbd product and our server and tools products to customers through our foreign regional operations centers in fiscal years 2012 and 2011 our us income before income taxes was 16 billion and 89 billion respectively and comprised 7 and 32 respectively of our income before income taxes in fiscal years 2012 and 2011 the foreign income before income taxes was 207 billion and 192 billion respectively and comprised 93 and 68 respectively of our income before income taxes the primary driver for the decrease in the us income before income tax in fiscal year 2012 was the goodwill impairment charge 

tax contingencies and other tax liabilities were 76 billion and 74 billion as of june 30 2012 and 2011 respectively and are included in other longterm liabilities while we settled a portion of the irs audit for tax years 2004 to 2006 during the third quarter of fiscal year 2011 we remain under audit for these years in february 2012 the irs withdrew its 2011 revenue agents report and reopened the audit phase of the examination as of june 30 2012 the primary unresolved issue relates to transfer pricing which could have a significant impact on our financial statements if not resolved favorably we believe our allowances for tax contingencies are appropriate we do not believe it is reasonably possible that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits will significantly increase or decrease within the next 12 months as we do not believe the remaining open issues will be resolved within the next 12 months we also continue to be subject to examination by the irs for tax years 2007 to 2011 

fiscal year 2011 compared with fiscal year 2010 

our effective tax rates for fiscal years 2011 and 2010 were approximately 18 and 25 respectively our effective tax rate was lower than the us federal statutory rate and our prior year effective rate primarily due to a higher mix of earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting from producing and distributing our products and services through our foreign regional operations centers in ireland singapore and puerto rico which have lower income tax rates in fiscal years 2011 and 2010 our us income before income taxes was 89 billion and 96 billion respectively and comprised 32 and 38 respectively of our income before income taxes in fiscal years 2011 and 2010 the foreign income before income taxes was 192 billion and 154 billion respectively and comprised 68 and 62 respectively of our income before income taxes in fiscal years 2011 and 2010 the reduction of the us federal statutory rate as a result of foreign earnings taxed at lower rates was 16 and 12 respectively 

  

  

part ii 

item 7 

  

in addition our effective tax rate was lower than in the prior year due to a partial settlement with the irs in the third quarter of fiscal year 2011 relating to the audit of tax years 2004 to 2006 this partial settlement reduced our income tax expense for fiscal year 2011 by 461 million 

financial condition 

cash cash equivalents and investments 

cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments totaled 630 billion as of june 30 2012 compared with 528 billion as of june 30 2011 equity and other investments were 98 billion as of june 30 2012 compared with 109 billion as of june 30 2011 our shortterm investments are primarily to facilitate liquidity and for capital preservation they consist predominantly of highly liquid investmentgrade fixedincome securities diversified among industries and individual issuers the investments are predominantly us dollardenominated securities but also include foreign currencydenominated securities in order to diversify risk our fixedincome investments are exposed to interest rate risk and credit risk the credit risk and average maturity of our fixedincome portfolio are managed to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain fixedincome indices the settlement risk related to these investments is insignificant given that the shortterm investments held are primarily highly liquid investmentgrade fixedincome securities while we own certain mortgagebacked and assetbacked fixedincome securities our portfolio as of june 30 2012 does not contain direct exposure to subprime mortgages or structured vehicles that derive their value from subprime collateral the majority of our mortgagebacked securities are collateralized by prime residential mortgages and carry a 100 principal and interest guarantee primarily from federal national mortgage association federal home loan mortgage corporation and government national mortgage association 

we routinely monitor our financial exposure to both sovereign and nonsovereign borrowers and counterparties our gross exposures to our customers and investments in portugal italy ireland greece and spain are individually and collectively not material 

of the cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments at june 30 2012 approximately 54 billion was held by our foreign subsidiaries and would be subject to material repatriation tax effects the amount of cash and investments held by foreign subsidiaries subject to other restrictions on the free flow of funds primarily currency and other local regulatory was approximately 660 million as of june 30 2012 approximately 77 of the shortterm investments held by our foreign subsidiaries were invested in us government and agency securities approximately 10 were invested in corporate notes and bonds of us companies and 3 were invested in us mortgagebacked securities all of which are denominated in us dollars 

securities lending 

we lend certain fixedincome and equity securities to increase investment returns the loaned securities continue to be carried as investments on our balance sheet cash andor security interests are received as collateral for the loaned securities with the amount determined based upon the underlying security lent and the creditworthiness of the borrower cash received is recorded as an asset with a corresponding liability our securities lending payable balance was 814 million as of june 30 2012 our average and maximum securities lending payable balances for the fiscal year were 12 billion and 14 billion respectively intrayear variances in the amount of securities loaned are mainly due to fluctuations in the demand for the securities 

valuation 

in general and where applicable we use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities to determine the fair value of our financial instruments this pricing methodology applies to our level 1 investments such as exchangetraded mutual funds domestic and international equities and us treasuries if quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities are not available to determine fair value then we use quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities or inputs other than the quoted prices that are observable either directly or indirectly this pricing methodology applies to our level 2 investments such as corporate notes and bonds foreign government 

  

  

part ii 

item 7 

  

bonds mortgagebacked securities and agency securities level 3 investments are valued using internally developed models with unobservable inputs assets and liabilities measured using unobservable inputs are an immaterial portion of our portfolio 

a majority of our investments are priced by pricing vendors and are generally level 1 or level 2 investments as these vendors either provide a quoted market price in an active market or use observable inputs for their pricing without applying significant adjustments broker pricing is used mainly when a quoted price is not available the investment is not priced by our pricing vendors or when a broker price is more reflective of fair values in the market in which the investment trades our brokerpriced investments are generally labeled as level 2 investments because the broker prices these investments based on similar assets without applying significant adjustments in addition all of our brokerpriced investments have a sufficient level of trading volume to demonstrate that the fair values used are appropriate for these investments our fair value processes include controls that are designed to ensure appropriate fair values are recorded these controls include model validation review of key model inputs analysis of periodoverperiod fluctuations and independent recalculation of prices where appropriate 

cash flows 

fiscal year 2012 compared with fiscal year 2011 

cash flows from operations increased 46 billion during the current fiscal year to 316 billion due mainly to increased revenue and cash collections from customers cash used for financing increased 10 billion to 94 billion due mainly to a 60 billion net decrease in proceeds from issuances of debt and a 12 billion increase in dividends paid offset in part by a 65 billion decrease in cash used for common stock repurchases cash used in investing increased 102 billion to 248 billion due mainly to a 100 billion increase in acquisitions of businesses and purchases of intangible assets and a 14 billion decrease in cash from securities lending activities partially offset by a 12 billion decrease in cash used for net purchases maturities and sales of investments 

fiscal year 2011 compared with fiscal year 2010 

cash flows from operations increased 29 billion during the current fiscal year to 270 billion due mainly to increased revenue and cash collections from customers cash used in financing decreased 49 billion to 84 billion due mainly to a 58 billion increase in proceeds from issuance of debt net of repayments offset in part by a 602 million increase in cash paid for dividends cash used in investing increased 33 billion to 146 billion due to a 58 billion increase in purchases of investments offset in part by a 25 billion increase in cash from securities lending 

debt 

we issued debt in prior periods to take advantage of favorable pricing and liquidity in the debt markets reflecting our credit rating and the low interest rate environment the proceeds of these issuances were used to partially fund discretionary business acquisitions and share repurchases 

as of june 30 2012 the total carrying value and estimated fair value of our longterm debt including the current portion were 119 billion and 132 billion respectively this is compared with a carrying value and estimated fair value of 119 billion and 121 billion respectively as of june 30 2011 these estimated fair values are based on level 2 inputs 

  

  

part ii 

item 7 

  

the components of our longterm debt including the current portion and the associated interest rates and semiannual interest record and payment dates were as follows as of june 30 2012 

 

 as of june 30 2012 the aggregate unamortized discount for our longterm debt including the current portion was 56 million 

notes 

the notes are senior unsecured obligations and rank equally with our other unsecured and unsubordinated debt outstanding 

convertible debt 

in june 2010 we issued 125 billion of zero coupon convertible unsecured debt due on june 15 2013 in a private placement offering proceeds from the offering were 124 billion net of fees and expenses which were capitalized initially each 1000 principal amount of notes was convertible into 2994 shares of microsoft common stock at a conversion price of 3340 per share the conversion ratio is adjusted periodically for dividends in excess of the initial dividend threshold as defined in the debt agreement as of june 30 2012 the net carrying amount of our convertible debt was 12 billion and the unamortized discount was 19 million 

prior to march 15 2013 the notes will be convertible only in certain circumstances into cash and if applicable cash shares of microsoft’s common stock or a combination thereof at our election on or after march 15 2013 the notes will be convertible at any time upon conversion we will pay cash up to the aggregate principal amount of the notes and pay or deliver cash shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock at our election 

because the convertible debt may be wholly or partially settled in cash we are required to separately account for the liability and equity components of the notes in a manner that reflects our nonconvertible debt borrowing rate when interest costs are recognized in subsequent periods the net proceeds of 124 billion were allocated between debt for 118 billion and stockholders’ equity for 58 million with the portion in stockholders’ equity representing the fair value of the option to convert the debt 

in connection with the issuance of the notes we entered into capped call transactions with certain option counterparties who are initial purchasers of the notes or their affiliates the capped call transactions are expected to 

  

  

part ii 

item 7 

  

reduce potential dilution of earnings per share upon conversion of the notes under the capped call transactions we purchased from the option counterparties capped call options that in the aggregate relate to the total number of shares of our common stock underlying the notes with a strike price equal to the conversion price of the notes and with an initial cap price equal to 3716 which is adjusted periodically to mirror any adjustments to the conversion price the purchased capped calls were valued at 40 million and recorded to stockholders’ equity 

unearned revenue 

unearned revenue at june 30 2012 comprised mainly unearned revenue from volume licensing programs unearned revenue from volume licensing programs represents customer billings for multiyear licensing arrangements paid for either at inception of the agreement or annually at the beginning of each billing coverage period and accounted for as subscriptions with revenue recognized ratably over the billing coverage period unearned revenue at june 30 2012 also included payments for postdelivery support and consulting services to be performed in the future xbox live subscriptions and prepaid points the windows upgrade offer microsoft dynamics business solutions products skype prepaid credits and subscriptions oem minimum commitments and other offerings for which we have been paid in advance and earn the revenue when we provide the service or software or otherwise meet the revenue recognition criteria 

the following table outlines the expected future recognition of unearned revenue as of june 30 2012

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we provide indemnifications of varying scope and size to certain customers against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products and certain other matters in evaluating estimated losses on these indemnifications we consider factors such as the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and our ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss to date we have not encountered significant costs as a result of these obligations and have not accrued in our financial statements any liabilities related to these indemnifications 

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes the payments due by fiscal year for our outstanding contractual obligations as of june 30 2012 

 

  

     other planned uses of capital 

on july 18 2012 we acquired yammer inc “yammer” a leading provider of enterprise social networks for 12 billion in cash yammer will continue to develop its standalone service and will add an enterprise social networking service to microsoft’s portfolio of complementary cloudbased services 

we will continue to invest in sales marketing product support infrastructure and existing and advanced areas of technology additions to property and equipment will continue including new facilities data centers and computer systems for research and development sales and marketing support and administrative staff we have operating leases for most us and international sales and support offices and certain equipment we have not engaged in any related party transactions or arrangements with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect liquidity or the availability of capital resources 

liquidity 

we earn a significant amount of our operating income outside the us which is deemed to be permanently reinvested in foreign jurisdictions as a result as discussed above under cash cash equivalents and investments 

  

  

part ii 

item 7 

  

the majority of our cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments are held by foreign subsidiaries we currently do not intend nor foresee a need to repatriate these funds we expect existing domestic cash cash equivalents shortterm investments and cash flows from operations to continue to be sufficient to fund our domestic operating activities and cash commitments for investing and financing activities such as regular quarterly dividends debt repayment schedules and material capital expenditures for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future in addition we expect existing foreign cash cash equivalents shortterm investments and cash flows from operations to continue to be sufficient to fund our foreign operating activities and cash commitments for investing activities such as material capital expenditures for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future 

should we require more capital in the us than is generated by our operations domestically for example to fund significant discretionary activities such as business acquisitions and share repurchases we could elect to repatriate future earnings from foreign jurisdictions or raise capital in the us through debt or equity issuances these alternatives could result in higher effective tax rates increased interest expense or dilution of our earnings we have borrowed funds domestically and continue to believe we have the ability to do so at reasonable interest rates 

recent accounting guidance

we review investments quarterly for indicators of otherthantemporary impairment this determination requires significant judgment in making this judgment we employ a systematic methodology quarterly that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments if the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value we evaluate among other factors general market conditions credit quality of debt instrument issuers the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost and for equity securities our intent and ability to hold or plans to sell the investment for fixedincome securities we also evaluate whether we have plans to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery we also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the investee including industry and sector performance changes in technology and operational and financing cash flow factors once a decline in fair value is determined to be otherthantemporary an impairment charge is recorded to other income expense and a new cost basis in the investment is established if market industry andor investee conditions deteriorate we may incur future impairments 

goodwill 

we allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the business combination we evaluate our reporting units on an annual basis and if necessary reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level operating segment or one level below an operating segment on an annual basis may 1 for us and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value these events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate legal factors operating performance indicators competition or sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit 

  

  

part ii 

item 7 

  

application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment including the identification of reporting units assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units assignment of goodwill to reporting units and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit the fair value of each reporting unit is estimated using a discounted cash flow methodology this analysis requires significant judgments including estimation of future cash flows which is dependent on internal forecasts estimation of the longterm rate of growth for our business estimation of the useful life over which cash flows will occur and determination of our weighted average cost of capital 

the estimates used to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit change from year to year based on operating results market conditions and other factors changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and goodwill impairment for each reporting unit 

research and development costs 

costs incurred internally in researching and developing a computer software product are charged to expense until technological feasibility has been established for the product once technological feasibility is established all software costs are capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers judgment is required in determining when technological feasibility of a product is established we have determined that technological feasibility for our software products is reached after all highrisk development issues have been resolved through coding and testing generally this occurs shortly before the products are released to manufacturing the amortization of these costs is included in cost of revenue over the estimated life of the products 

legal and other contingencies 

the outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought against us are subject to significant uncertainty an estimated loss from a loss contingency such as a legal proceeding or claim is accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated disclosure of a contingency is required if there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss has been incurred in determining whether a loss should be accrued we evaluate among other factors the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss changes in these factors could materially impact our financial statements 

income taxes 

the objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity’s financial statements or tax returns we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement accounting literature also provides guidance on derecognition of income tax assets and liabilities classification of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities accounting for interest and penalties associated with tax positions and income tax disclosures judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our financial statements 

stockbased compensation 

stockbased compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense net of estimated forfeitures over the requisite service period determining the fair value of stockbased awards at the grant date requires judgment including estimating expected dividends in addition judgment is also required in estimating the amount of stockbased awards that are expected to be forfeited if actual results differ significantly from these estimates stockbased compensation expense and our results of operations could be impacted

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

risks 

we are exposed to economic risk from foreign currency exchange rates interest rates credit risk equity prices and commodity prices a portion of these risks is hedged but they may impact our financial statements 

foreign currency 

certain forecasted transactions assets and liabilities are exposed to foreign currency risk we monitor our foreign currency exposures daily and use hedges where practicable to offset the risks and maximize the economic effectiveness of our foreign currency positions principal currencies hedged include the euro japanese yen british pound and canadian dollar 

interest rate 

our fixedincome portfolio is diversified across credit sectors and maturities consisting primarily of investmentgrade securities the credit risk and average maturity of the fixedincome portfolio is managed to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain global and domestic fixedincome indices in addition we use “to be announced” forward purchase commitments of mortgagebacked assets to gain exposure to agency and mortgagebacked securities 

equity 

our equity portfolio consists of global developed and emerging market securities that are subject to market price risk we manage the securities relative to certain global and domestic indices and expect their economic risk and return to correlate with these indices 

commodity 

we use broadbased commodity exposures to enhance portfolio returns and facilitate portfolio diversification our investment portfolio has exposure to a variety of commodities including precious metals energy and grain we manage these exposures relative to global commodity indices and expect their economic risk and return to correlate with these indices 

valueatrisk 

we use a valueatrisk “var” model to estimate and quantify our market risks var is the expected loss for a given confidence level in the fair value of our portfolio due to adverse market movements over a defined time horizon the var model is not intended to represent actual losses in fair value including determinations of otherthantemporary losses in fair value in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states “us gaap” but is used as a risk estimation and management tool the distribution of the potential changes in total market value of all holdings is computed based on the historical volatilities and correlations among foreign currency exchange rates interest rates equity prices and commodity prices assuming normal market conditions 

the var is calculated as the total loss that will not be exceeded at the 975 percentile confidence level or alternatively stated the losses could exceed the var in 25 out of 1000 cases several risk factors are not captured in the model including liquidity risk operational risk and legal risk

item 7a 

  

the following table sets forth the oneday var for substantially all of our positions as of june 30 2012 and june 30 2011 and for the year ended june 30 2012 

 

 total oneday var for the combined risk categories was 292 million at june 30 2012 and 290 million at june 30 2011 the total var is 26 less at june 30 2012 and 25 less at june 30 2011 than the sum of the separate risk categories in the above table due to the diversification benefit of the combination of risks

competition 

entertainment and devices businesses are highly competitive characterized by rapid product life cycles frequent introductions of new products and game titles and the development of new technologies the markets for our products are characterized by significant price competition and we anticipate continued pricing pressure from our competitors our competitors vary in size from very small companies with limited resources to very large diversified corporations with substantial financial and marketing resources we compete primarily on the basis of product innovation quality and variety timing of product releases and effectiveness of distribution and marketing 

our xbox gaming and entertainment business competes with console platforms from nintendo and sony both of which have a large established base of customers the lifecycle for gaming and entertainment consoles averages five to 10 years we released xbox 360 our second generation console in november 2005 nintendo and sony released new versions of their game consoles in late 2006 we believe the success of gaming and entertainment consoles is determined by the availability of games for the console providing exclusive game content that gamers seek the computational power and reliability of the console and the ability to create new experiences via online services downloadable content and peripherals in addition to nintendo and sony our businesses compete with both apple and google in offering content products and services to the consumer we believe the xbox 360 entertainment platform is positioned well against competitive products and services based on significant innovation in hardware architecture new developer tools online gaming and entertainment services and continued strong exclusive content from our own game franchises as well as other digital content offerings

product development and intellectual property 

most of our software products and services are developed internally internal development allows us to maintain competitive advantages that come from closer technical control over our products and services it also gives us the freedom to decide which modifications and enhancements are most important and when they should be implemented we strive to obtain information as early as possible about changing usage patterns and hardware advances that may affect software design before releasing new software platforms we provide application vendors with a range of resources and guidelines for development training and testing generally we also create product documentation internally 

we protect our investments in innovation in a variety of ways we work actively in the us and internationally to ensure the enforcement of copyright trademark trade secret and other protections that apply to our software products services business plans and branding we are a leader among technology companies in pursuing patents and currently have a portfolio of over 26000 us and international patents issued and over 36000 pending while we employ many of our innovations exclusively in microsoft products and services we also engage in outbound and inbound licensing of specific patented technologies that are incorporated into licensees’ or microsoft’s products from time to time we enter into broader crosslicense agreements with other technology companies covering entire groups of patents from time to time we purchase or license technology that we incorporate in our products or services 

while it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of our products and business methods we believe based upon past experience and industry practice such licenses generally could be obtained on commercially reasonable terms we believe our continuing innovation and product development are not materially dependent on any single license or other agreement with a third party relating to the development of our products

investing in innovation 

innovation is the foundation for microsoft’s success our model for growth is based on our ability to initiate and embrace disruptive technology trends to enter new markets both in terms of geographies and product areas and to drive broad adoption of the products and services we develop and market our innovation investments focus on the emerging technology trends and breakthroughs that we believe offer significant opportunities to deliver value to our customers and growth for the company we maintain our longterm commitment to research and development across a wide spectrum of technologies tools and platforms spanning communication and collaboration information access and organization entertainment business and ecommerce advertising and devices 

while our main research and development facilities are located in redmond washington we also operate research and development facilities in other parts of the us and around the world including canada china denmark england india ireland and israel this global approach will help us remain competitive in local markets and enable us to continue to attract top talent from across the world we generally fund research at the corporate level to ensure that we are looking beyond immediate product considerations to opportunities further in the future we also fund research and development activities at the business segment level many of the innovations created by our business segments are coordinated with other segments and leveraged across the company 

in addition to our main research and development operations we also operate microsoft research microsoft research is one of the world’s largest computer science research organizations and works in close collaboration with top universities around the world to advance the stateoftheart in computer science providing us a unique perspective on future technology trends 

based on our assessment of key technology trends and our broad focus on longterm research and development of new products and services areas where we see significant opportunities to drive future growth include smart connected devices cloud computing entertainment search communications and productivity 

distribution sales and marketing 

we market and distribute our products and services primarily through the following channels oem distributors and resellers and online 

oem 

we distribute software through oems that preinstall our software on new pcs servers smartphones and other intelligent devices that they sell to end customers the largest component of the oem business is the windows operating system preinstalled on pcs oems also sell hardware preinstalled with other microsoft products including server operating systems and application products and desktop applications such as our microsoft office suite in addition to these products we also market through oems software services such as our windows live essentials suite 

there are two broad categories of oems the largest oems many of which operate globally are referred to as “direct oems” as our relationship with them is managed through a direct agreement between microsoft and the manufacturer we have distribution agreements covering one or more of our products with virtually all of the multinational oems including acer asustek dell fujitsu htc hewlettpackard lg lenovo nec nokia samsung sony toshiba and with many regional and local oems including medion msi and positivo the second broad category of oems consists of lowervolume pc manufacturers also called “system builders” which source their microsoft software for preinstallation and local redistribution primarily through the microsoft distributor channel rather than through a direct agreement or relationship with microsoft some of the distributors in the microsoft distributor channel are global such as ingram micro and tech data but most operate at a local or regional level

distributors and resellers 

many organizations that license our products and services through enterprise agreements transact directly with us with sales support from solution integrators independent software vendors web agencies and developers that advise organizations on licensing our products and services “enterprise software advisors” organizations also license our products and services indirectly primarily through large account resellers “lars” distributors valueadded resellers “vars” oems system builder channels and retailers although each type of reselling partner reaches organizations of all sizes lars are primarily engaged with large organizations distributors resell primarily to vars and vars typically reach smallsized and mediumsized organizations enterprise software advisors typically are also authorized as lars and operate as resellers for our other licensing programs such as the select and open licensing programs discussed under “licensing options” below some of our distributors include ingram micro and tech data and some of our largest resellers include cdw dell insight enterprises and software house international our microsoft dynamics software offerings are licensed to enterprises through a global network of channel partners providing vertical solutions and specialized services we distribute our retail packaged products primarily through independent nonexclusive distributors authorized replicators resellers and retail outlets individual consumers obtain these products primarily through retail outlets such as walmart and dixons we have a network of field sales representatives and field support personnel that solicits orders from distributors and resellers and provides product training and sales support 

online 

although clientbased software will continue to be an important part of our business increasingly we are delivering additional value to customers through cloudbased services we provide online content and services to consumers through bing msn portals and channels microsoft office web apps microsoft security essentials windows live essentials suite windows phone marketplace xbox live and zune marketplace we provide content and services to business users through the microsoft online services platform which includes cloudbased services such as business productivity online standard suite exchange online microsoft dynamics crm online microsoft lync microsoft office 365 microsoft office communications online microsoft office live meeting sql azure sharepoint online windows azure and windows intune other services delivered online include our online advertising platform with offerings for advertisers as well as microsoft developer networks subscription content and updates periodic product updates and online technical and practice readiness resources to support our partners in developing and selling our products and solutions 

licensing options 

we license software to organizations under arrangements that allow the enduser customer to acquire multiple licenses of products and services our arrangements for organizations to acquire multiple licenses of products and services are designed to provide them with a means of doing so without having to acquire separate packaged product through retail channels in delivering organizational licensing arrangements to the market we use different programs designed to provide flexibility for organizations of various sizes while these programs may differ in various parts of the world generally they include those discussed below 

open licensing 

designed primarily for smalltomedium organizations 5 to over 250 licenses open licensing programs allow customers to acquire perpetual or subscription licenses and at the customer’s election rights to future versions of software products over a specified time period two or three years depending on the open program used the offering that conveys rights to future versions of certain software products over the contract period is called software assurance software assurance also provides support tools and training to help customers deploy and use software efficiently under the open program customers can acquire licenses only or licenses with software assurance they can also renew software assurance upon the expiration of existing volume licensing agreements

item 1 

  

  

select licensing 

designed primarily for mediumtolarge organizations greater than 250 licenses the select program allows customers to acquire perpetual licenses and at the customer’s election software assurance over a specified time period generally three years or less similar to the open program the select program allows customers to acquire licenses only acquire licenses with software assurance or renew software assurance upon the expiration of existing volume licensing agreements online services are also available for purchase through the select program and subscriptions are generally structured with terms between one and three years 

services provider licensing 

the microsoft services provider license agreement “spla” is a program targeted to service providers and independent software vendors “isvs” allowing these partners to provide software services and hosted applications to their end customers agreements are generally structured with a threeyear term and partners are billed monthly based upon consumption 

enterprise agreement licensing 

enterprise agreements are targeted at medium and large organizations greater than 250 licenses that want to acquire licenses to software products along with software assurance for all or substantial parts of their enterprise enterprises can elect to either acquire perpetual licenses or under the enterprise subscription program can acquire nonperpetual subscription agreements for a specified time period generally three years online services are also available for purchase through the enterprise agreement and subscriptions are generally structured with three year terms 

customers 

our customers include individual consumers small and mediumsized organizations enterprises governmental institutions educational institutions internet service providers application developers and oems consumers and small and mediumsized organizations obtain our products primarily through distributors resellers and oems no sales to an individual customer accounted for more than 10 of fiscal year 2011 2010 or 2009 revenue our practice is to ship our products promptly upon receipt of purchase orders from customers consequently backlog is not significant

 item 1a risk factors 

our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties including those described below that could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations cash flows and the trading price of our common stock 

the cloudbased computing model presents execution and competitive risks we are transitioning our strategy to a computing environment characterized by cloudbased services used with smart client devices our competitors are rapidly developing and deploying cloudbased services for consumers and business customers pricing and delivery models are evolving devices and form factors influence how users access services in the cloud we are devoting significant resources to develop and deploy our own competing cloudbased software plus services strategies while we believe our expertise investments in infrastructure and the breadth of our cloudbased services provides us with a strong foundation to compete it is uncertain whether our strategies will attract the users or generate the revenue required to be successful in addition to software development costs we are incurring costs to build and maintain infrastructure to support cloud computing services these costs may reduce the operating margins we have previously achieved whether we are successful in this new business model depends on our execution in a number of areas including 

 

  

  

  

   

  

part i 

item 1a 

  

  

challenges to our business models may reduce our revenue or operating margins whether our software runs in the cloud or on a device we continue to face challenges from alternative means of developing and licensing software under our licensebased software model software developers bear the costs of converting original ideas into software products through investments in research and development offsetting these costs with the revenue received from the distribution of their products certain “open source” software business models challenge our licensebased software model open source commonly refers to software whose source code is subject to a license allowing it to be modified combined with other software and redistributed subject to restrictions set forth in the license some companies compete with us using an open source business model by modifying and then distributing open source software to end users at nominal cost and earning revenue on complementary services and products these firms do not bear the full costs of research and development for the software in some cases their products may infringe our patents in addition advertisingbased business models seek revenue by delivering third party advertisements to end customers who receive the software and services at no direct costs gains in market acceptance of open source or advertising based software may adversely affect our sales revenue and operating margins 

an important element of our business model has been to create platformbased ecosystems on which many participants can build diverse solutions a competing verticallyintegrated model in which a single firm controls both the software and hardware elements of a product has been successful with certain consumer products such as personal computers mobile phones and digital music players we also offer verticallyintegrated hardware and software products however efforts to compete with the vertically integrated model may increase our cost of sales and reduce our operating margins 

we derive substantial revenue from licenses of windows operating systems on personal computers the proliferation of alternative devices and form factors creates challenges from competing software platforms it is uncertain to what extent alternative devices will increase the number of computing devices that users own or will substitute for users’ personal computer purchases alternative devices also run operating systems and applications developed by our competitors these factors could impact our revenue and margins 

we face intense competition we continue to experience intense competition across all markets for our products and services our competitors range in size from fortune 100 companies to small specialized singleproduct businesses and open source communitybased projects although we believe the breadth of our businesses and product portfolio is a competitive advantage our competitors that are focused on narrower product lines may be more effective in devoting technical marketing and financial resources to compete with us in addition barriers to entry in our businesses generally are low and products once developed can be distributed broadly and quickly at relatively low cost open source software vendors are devoting considerable efforts to developing software that mimics the features and functionality of our products in some cases in violation of our intellectual property rights or on the basis of technical specifications for microsoft technologies that we make available at little or no cost in connection with our interoperability initiatives in response to competition we continue to develop versions of our products with basic functionality that are sold at lower prices than the standard versions these competitive pressures may result in decreased sales volumes price reductions andor increased operating costs such as for marketing and sales incentives resulting in lower revenue gross margins and operating income 

we may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property rights protecting our global intellectual property rights and combating unlicensed copying and use of software and other intellectual property is difficult while piracy adversely affects us revenue the impact on revenue from outside the us is more significant particularly in countries where laws are less protective of intellectual property rights as a result our revenue in these markets likely will grow slower than the underlying pc market similarly the absence of harmonized patent laws makes it more difficult to ensure consistent respect for patent rights throughout the world we actively educate consumers about the benefits of licensing genuine products and obtaining indemnification benefits for intellectual property risks and we educate lawmakers about the advantages of a business climate where intellectual property rights are protected however continued educational and enforcement efforts may fail to enhance revenue reductions in the legal protection for software intellectual property rights could adversely affect revenue 

third parties may claim we infringe their intellectual property rights from time to time we receive notices from others claiming we infringe their intellectual property rights because of constant technological change in the 

  

  

part i 

item 1a 

  

  

segments in which we compete the extensive patent coverage of existing technologies and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents it is possible the number of these claims may grow to resolve these claims we may enter into royalty and licensing agreements on less favorable terms stop selling or redesign affected products or pay damages to satisfy indemnification commitments with our customers such agreements may cause operating margins to decline we have made and expect to continue making significant expenditures to settle claims related to the use of technology and intellectual property rights as part of our strategy to manage this risk 

we may not be able to protect our source code from copying if there is an unauthorized disclosure of source code source code the detailed program commands for our operating systems and other software programs is critical to our business although we license portions of our application and operating system source code to a number of licensees we take significant measures to protect the secrecy of large portions of our source code if an unauthorized disclosure of a significant portion of our source code occurs we could potentially lose future trade secret protection for that source code this could make it easier for third parties to compete with our products by copying functionality which could adversely affect our revenue and operating margins unauthorized disclosure of source code also could increase the security risks described in the next paragraph 

security vulnerabilities could lead to reduced revenue liability claims or competitive harm maintaining the security of computers and computer networks is paramount for us and our customers hackers develop and deploy viruses worms and other malicious software programs that attack our products and services and gain access to our networks and data centers although this is an industrywide problem that affects computers across all platforms it affects our products and services in particular because hackers tend to focus their efforts on the most popular operating systems programs and services and we expect them to continue to do so groups of hackers may also act in a coordinated manner to launch distributed denial of service attacks or other coordinated attacks that may cause service outages or other interruptions we devote significant resources to address security vulnerabilities through 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 the cost of these steps could reduce our operating margins despite these efforts actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products and services could cause significant reputational harm and lead some customers to seek to return products to reduce or delay future purchases or adoption of services or to use competing products customers may also increase their expenditures on protecting their existing computer systems from attack which could delay adoption of new technologies any of these actions by customers could adversely affect our revenue actual or perceived vulnerabilities may lead to claims against us although our license agreements typically contain provisions that eliminate or limit our exposure to such liability there is no assurance these provisions will withstand all legal challenges 

in addition our internal information technology environment continues to evolve we are often early adopters of new devices and technologies we embrace new ways of sharing data and communicating with partners and customers using methods such as social networking these practices can enhance efficiency and business insight but they also present risks that our business policies and internal security controls may not keep pace with the speed of these changes if third parties gain access to our networks or data centers they could obtain and exploit confidential business information and harm our competitive position

item 1a 

  

  

improper disclosure of personal data could result in liability and harm our reputation as we continue to execute our strategy of increasing the number and scale of our cloudbased offerings we store and process increasingly large amounts of personally identifiable information of our customers at the same time the continued occurrence of highprofile data breaches provides evidence of an external environment increasingly hostile to information security this environment demands that we continuously improve our design and coordination of security controls across our business groups and geographies despite these efforts it is possible our security controls over personal data our training of employees and vendors on data security and other practices we follow may not prevent the improper disclosure of personally identifiable information improper disclosure of this information could harm our reputation lead to legal exposure to customers or subject us to liability under laws that protect personal data resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue our software products and services also enable our customers to store and process personal data on premises or increasingly in a cloudbased environment we host we believe consumers using our email messaging storage sharing and social networking services will increasingly want efficient centralized methods of choosing their privacy preferences and controlling their data perceptions that our products or services do not adequately protect the privacy of personal information could inhibit sales of our products or services and could constrain consumer and business adoption of cloudbased solutions 

we may experience outages data loss and disruptions of our online services if we fail to maintain an adequate operations infrastructure our increasing user traffic and complexity of our products and services demand more computing power we have spent and expect to continue to spend substantial amounts to purchase or lease data centers and equipment and to upgrade our technology and network infrastructure to handle increased traffic on our web sites and in our data centers and to introduce new products and services and support existing services such as bing exchange online office 365 sharepoint online xbox live windows azure windows live and microsoft office web apps we also are growing our business of providing a platform and backend hosting for services provided by thirdparty businesses to their end customers maintaining and expanding this infrastructure is expensive and complex inefficiencies or operational failures including temporary or permanent loss of customer data could diminish the quality of our products services and user experience resulting in contractual liability claims by customers and other third parties damage to our reputation and loss of current and potential users subscribers and advertisers each of which may harm our operating results and financial condition 

we are subject to government litigation and regulatory activity that affects how we design and market our products as a leading global software maker we receive close scrutiny from government agencies under us and foreign competition laws some jurisdictions also provide private rights of action for competitors or consumers to assert claims of anticompetitive conduct for example we have been involved in the following actions 

lawsuits brought by the us department of justice 18 states and the district of columbia in two separate actions were resolved through a consent decree that took effect in 2001 and a final judgment entered in 2002 these proceedings imposed various constraints on our windows operating system businesses these constraints included limits on certain contracting practices mandated disclosure of certain software program interfaces and protocols and rights for computer manufacturers to limit the visibility of certain windows features in new pcs although the consent decree and final judgment expired in may 2011 we expect that federal and state antitrust authorities will continue to closely scrutinize our business 

the european commission closely scrutinizes the design of highvolume microsoft products and the terms on which we make certain technologies used in these products such as file formats programming interfaces and protocols available to other companies in 2004 the commission ordered us to create new versions of windows that do not include certain multimedia technologies and to provide our competitors with specifications for how to implement certain proprietary windows communications protocols in their own products in 2009 the commission accepted a set of commitments offered by microsoft to address the commission’s concerns relating to competition in web browsing software the commission’s impact on product design may limit our ability to innovate in windows or other products in the future diminish the developer appeal of the windows platform and increase our product development costs the availability of licenses related to protocols and file formats may enable competitors to develop software products that better mimic the functionality of our own products which could result in decreased sales of our products

government regulatory actions and court decisions such as these may hinder our ability to provide the benefits of our software to consumers and businesses thereby reducing the attractiveness of our products and the revenue that come from them new actions could be initiated at any time either by these or other governments or private claimants including with respect to new versions of windows or other microsoft products the outcome of such actions or steps taken to avoid them could adversely affect us in a variety of ways including 

 

  

  

 our software and services online offerings are subject to government regulation of the internet domestically and internationally in many areas including user privacy telecommunications data protection and online content the application of these laws and regulations to our business is often unclear and sometimes may conflict compliance with these regulations may involve significant costs or require changes in business practices that result in reduced revenue noncompliance could result in penalties being imposed on us or orders that we stop the alleged noncompliant activity 

our business depends on our ability to attract and retain talented employees our business is based on successfully attracting and retaining talented employees the market for highly skilled workers and leaders in our industry is extremely competitive we are limited in our ability to recruit internationally by restrictive domestic immigration laws if we are less successful in our recruiting efforts or if we are unable to retain key employees our ability to develop and deliver successful products and services may be adversely affected effective succession planning is also important to our longterm success failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution 

delays in product development schedules may adversely affect our revenue the development of software products is a complex and timeconsuming process new products and enhancements to existing products can require long development and testing periods our increasing focus on cloudbased software plus services also presents new and complex development issues significant delays in new product or service releases or significant problems in creating new products or services could adversely affect our revenue 

we make significant investments in new products and services that may not be profitable our growth depends on our ability to innovate by offering new and adding value to our existing software and service offerings we will continue to make significant investments in research development and marketing for new products services and technologies including the windows pc operating system the microsoft office system bing windows phone windows server windows live the windows azure services platform and other cloudbased services offerings and the xbox 360 entertainment platform investments in new technology are speculative commercial success depends on many factors including innovativeness developer support and effective distribution and marketing our degree of success with windows phone for example will impact our ability to grow our share of the smartphone operating system market it will also be an important factor in supporting our strategy of delivering value to end users seamlessly over pc phone and tv device classes if customers do not perceive our latest offerings as providing significant new functionality or other value they may reduce their purchases of new software products or upgrades unfavorably impacting revenue we may not achieve significant revenue from new product and service investments for a number of years if at all moreover new products and services may not be profitable and even if they are profitable operating margins for new products and businesses may not be as high as the margins we have experienced historically 

adverse economic conditions may harm our business unfavorable changes in economic conditions including inflation recession or other changes in economic conditions may result in lower information technology spending and adversely affect our revenue if demand for pcs servers and other computing devices declines or consumer or 

  

  

part i 

item 1a 

  

  

business spending for those products declines our revenue will be adversely affected our product distribution system also relies on an extensive partner network the impact of economic conditions on our partners such as the bankruptcy of a major distributor could result in sales channel disruption challenging economic conditions also may impair the ability of our customers to pay for products and services they have purchased as a result reserves for doubtful accounts and writeoffs of accounts receivable may increase we maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings types and maturities these investments are subject to general credit liquidity market and interest rate risks which may be exacerbated by unusual events that have affected global financial markets a significant part of our investment portfolio consists of us government securities if global credit and equity markets experience prolonged periods of decline or if the us federal government budget process results in a default or downgrade of its debt our investment portfolio may be adversely impacted and we could determine that more of our investments have experienced an otherthantemporary decline in fair value requiring impairment charges that could adversely impact our financial results 

we have claims and lawsuits against us that may result in adverse outcomes we are subject to a variety of claims and lawsuits adverse outcomes in some or all of these claims may result in significant monetary damages or injunctive relief that could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business although management currently believes resolving all of these matters individually or in the aggregate will not have a material adverse impact on our financial statements the litigation and other claims are subject to inherent uncertainties and management’s view of these matters may change in the future a material adverse impact on our financial statements also could occur for the period in which the effect of an unfavorable final outcome becomes probable and reasonably estimable 

we may have additional tax liabilities we are subject to income taxes in the us and many foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes in the ordinary course of our business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain we regularly are under audit by tax authorities although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals the results of an audit or litigation could have a material effect on our financial statements in the period or periods for which that determination is made 

we earn a significant amount of our operating income from outside the us and any repatriation of funds currently held in foreign jurisdictions may result in higher effective tax rates for the company in addition there have been proposals to change us tax laws that would significantly impact how us multinational corporations are taxed on foreign earnings although we cannot predict whether or in what form this proposed legislation may pass if enacted it could have a material adverse impact on our tax expense and cash flow 

our verticallyintegrated hardware and software products may experience quality or supply problems our hardware products such as the xbox 360 console are highly complex and can have defects in design manufacture or associated software we could incur significant expenses lost revenue and reputational harm if we fail to detect or effectively address such issues through design testing or warranty repairs we obtain some components of our hardware devices from sole suppliers if a component delivery from a solesource supplier is delayed or becomes unavailable or industry shortages occur we may be unable to obtain timely replacement supplies resulting in reduced sales either component shortages or excess or obsolete inventory may increase our cost of revenue xbox 360 consoles are assembled in asia disruptions in the supply chain may result in console shortages that would affect our revenue and operating margins these same risks would apply to any other verticallyintegrated hardware and software products we may offer 

if our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets become impaired we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states “us gaap” we review our amortizable intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually factors that may be considered a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets may not be recoverable include a decline in stock price and market capitalization reduced future cash flow estimates and slower growth rates in our industry we may be required to record a significant charge in our financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets is determined negatively impacting our results of operations

we operate a global business that exposes us to additional risks we operate in over 100 countries and a significant part of our revenue comes from international sales pressure to make our pricing structure uniform might require that we reduce the sales price of our software in the us and other countries operations outside the us may be affected by changes in trade protection laws policies and measures and other regulatory requirements affecting trade and investment including the foreign corrupt practices act and local laws prohibiting corrupt payments emerging markets are a significant focus of our international growth strategy the developing nature of these markets presents a number of risks deterioration of social political labor or economic conditions in a specific country or region and difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations may also adversely affect our operations or financial results although we hedge a portion of our international currency exposure significant fluctuations in exchange rates between the us dollar and foreign currencies may adversely affect our net revenue 

catastrophic events or geopolitical conditions may disrupt our business a disruption or failure of our systems or operations in the event of a major earthquake weather event cyberattack terrorist attack or other catastrophic event could cause delays in completing sales providing services or performing other missioncritical functions our corporate headquarters a significant portion of our research and development activities and certain other critical business operations are located in the seattle washington area and we have other business operations in the silicon valley area of california both of which are near major earthquake faults a catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our critical business or information technology systems could harm our ability to conduct normal business operations our move toward providing our customers with more services and solutions in the cloud puts a premium on the resilience of our systems and strength of our business continuity management plans and magnifies the potential impact of prolonged outages on our operating results abrupt political change terrorist activity and armed conflict pose a risk of general economic disruption in affected countries which may increase our operating costs these conditions also may add uncertainty to the timing and budget for technology investment decisions by our customers and may result in supply chain disruptions for hardware manufacturers either of which may adversely affect our revenue the longterm effects of climate change on the global economy in general or the information technology industry in particular are unclear environmental regulations or changes in the supply demand or available sources of energy may affect the availability or cost of goods and services including natural resources necessary to run our business changes in weather where we operate may increase the costs of powering and cooling computer hardware we use to develop software and provide cloudbased services new regulations may require us to find alternative compliant and costeffective methods of distributing our products and services 

acquisitions joint ventures and strategic alliances may have an adverse effect on our business we expect to continue making acquisitions or entering into joint ventures and strategic alliances as part of our longterm business strategy these transactions involve significant challenges and risks including that the transaction does not advance our business strategy that we don’t realize a satisfactory return on our investment or that we experience difficulty integrating new employees business systems and technology or diversion of management’s attention from our other businesses it may take longer than expected to realize the full benefits such as increased revenue enhanced efficiencies or market share or those benefits may ultimately be smaller than anticipated or may not be realized these events could harm our operating results or financial condition

industry trends 

our industry is dynamic and highly competitive with frequent changes in both technologies and business models each industry shift is an opportunity to conceive new products new technologies or new ideas which can further transform the industry and our business at microsoft we push the boundaries of what is possible through a broad set of research and technology innovations that seek to anticipate the changing demands of customers industry trends and competitive forces 

key opportunities and investments 

based on our assessment of key technology trends and our broad focus on longterm research and development of new products and services we see significant opportunities to drive future growth 

smart connected devices 

the price per unit of processing storage and networks continues to decline while at the same time devices increase in capability this ongoing trend is increasing the capabilities of pcs mobile and other devices powered by rich software platforms and applications at the same time the information and services people use increasingly span multiple devices user experiences will be transformed by the adoption of cloud computing when brought together with the richness of smart connected devices microsoft is delivering experiences that seamlessly connect pcs and mobile and other devices through the cloud we are devoting significant resources to consumer cloud offerings like bing windows live and xbox live our software and hardware platform investments can be seen in products like kinect windows windows azure windows phone windows server and xbox 

cloud computing transforming the data center and information technology 

cloudbased solutions provide customers with software services and content over the internet by way of shared computing resources located in centralized data centers computing is undergoing a longterm shift from clientserver to the cloud a shift similar in importance and impact to the transition from mainframe to clientserver the shift to the cloud is driven by three important economies of scale larger data centers can deploy computational resources at significantly lower cost than smaller ones larger data centers include diverse customer geographic and application demand patterns which improve the utilization of computing storage and network resources and multitenancy lowers application maintenance labor costs for large public clouds as a result of the improved economics the cloud offers unique levels of elasticity and agility that will enable new solutions and applications for businesses of all sizes the cloud creates the opportunity to focus more on innovation while leaving nondifferentiating activities to reliable and costeffective providers for most businesses the first step in achieving cloud economics is the adoption of virtualization in their data center we are devoting significant resources to developing cloud infrastructure platforms and applications including offerings such as microsoft dynamics online microsoft sql azure office 365 windows azure windows intune and windows server 

entertainment 

the evolution of hardware software services and the cloud are enhancing the delivery and quality of unified entertainment experiences across many devices these rich media experiences include games movies music television and social interactions with family friends and colleagues at microsoft our approach is to simplify and increase the accessibility of these entertainment experiences to broaden market penetration of our software and services we invest significant resources in partnerships content windows phone xbox and xbox live 

search 

over the last two decades web content and social connections have increased dramatically as people spend more time online while discoverability and accessibility has been transforming from direct navigation and document links there is significant opportunity to deliver differentiated products that helps users make better decisions and

complete tasks more simply when using pc mobile and other devices our approach is to use machine learning to try to understand user intent and differentiate our product by focusing on the integration of visual social and other elements which simplifies people’s interaction with the internet we invest significant resources in bing sharepoint windows and windows phone 

communications and productivity 

personal and business productivity has been transformed by the ubiquity of computing and software tools over the last decade microsoft redefined software productivity beyond the rich office client on the pc productivity scenarios now encompass unified communications business intelligence collaboration content management and relationship management which are increasingly powered by serverside applications these server applications can be hosted by the customer a partner or by microsoft in the cloud there are significant opportunities to provide productivity and communication scenarios across pcs mobile devices and other devices that connect to services we invest significant resources in dynamics exchange lync office office 365 sharepoint and windows live 

economic conditions challenges and risks 

as discussed above our industry is dynamic and highly competitive we must anticipate changes in technology and business models our model for growth is based on our ability to initiate and embrace disruptive technology trends to enter new markets both in terms of geographies and product areas and to drive broad adoption of the products and services we develop and market 

at microsoft we prioritize our investments among the highest longterm growth opportunities these investments require significant resources and are multiyear in nature the products and services we bring to market can be built internally brought to market as part of a partnership or alliance or through acquisition 

our success is highly dependent on our ability to attract and retain qualified employees we rely on hiring from a mix of university and industry talent worldwide microsoft competes for talented individuals worldwide by offering broad customer reach scale in resources and competitive compensation 

demand for our software services and hardware has a strong correlation to global macroeconomic factors the current macroeconomic factors remain dynamic see a discussion of these factors and other risks under risk factors part 1 item 1a of this form 10k 

seasonality 

our revenue historically has fluctuated quarterly and has generally been the highest in the second quarter of our fiscal year due to corporate calendar yearend spending trends in our major markets and holiday season spending by consumers our entertainment and devices division is particularly seasonal as its products are aimed at the consumer market and are in highest demand during the holiday shopping season typically the entertainment and devices division has generated approximately 40 of its yearly segment revenue in our second fiscal quarter in addition quarterly revenue may be impacted by the deferral of revenue see the discussions below regarding sales of earlier versions of the microsoft office system with a guarantee to be upgraded to the newest version of the microsoft office system at minimal or no cost the “office deferral” and sales of windows vista with a guarantee to be upgraded to windows 7 at minimal or no cost and of windows 7 to retailers before general availability the “windows 7 deferral”

 we use derivative instruments to manage risks related to foreign currencies equity prices interest rates and credit to enhance investment returns and to facilitate portfolio diversification gains and losses from changes in fair values of derivatives that are not designated as hedges are recognized in other income expense these are generally offset by unrealized gains and losses in the underlying securities in the investment portfolio and are recorded as a component of other comprehensive income

our effective tax rates for fiscal years 2011 and 2010 were approximately 18 and 25 respectively our effective tax rate was lower than the us federal statutory rate and our prior year effective rate primarily due to a higher mix of earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting from producing and distributing our products and services through our foreign regional operations centers in ireland singapore and puerto rico which are subject to 

  

  

part ii 

item 7 

  

  

lower income tax rates in fiscal years 2011 and 2010 our us income before income taxes was 89 billion and 96 billion respectively and comprised 32 and 38 respectively of our income before income taxes in fiscal years 2011 and 2010 the foreign income before income taxes was 192 billion and 154 billion respectively and comprised 68 and 62 respectively of our income before income taxes in fiscal years 2011 and 2010 the reduction of the us federal statutory rate as a result of foreign earnings taxed at lower rates was 16 and 12 respectively 

in addition our effective tax rate was lower than in the prior year due to a partial settlement with the irs in the third quarter of fiscal year 2011 relating to the audit of tax years 2004 to 2006 this partial settlement reduced our income tax expense for fiscal year 2011 by 461 million 

tax contingencies and other tax liabilities were 74 billion and 69 billion as of june 30 2011 and 2010 respectively and are included in other longterm liabilities we have not provided deferred us income taxes or foreign withholding taxes on temporary differences of approximately 448 billion resulting from earnings for certain nonus subsidiaries because they are permanently reinvested outside the us the unrecognized deferred tax liability associated with these temporary differences was approximately 142 billion as of june 30 2011 

while we settled a portion of the irs audit for tax years 2004 to 2006 during the third quarter of fiscal year 2011 we remain under audit for these years during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2011 the irs completed its examination and issued a revenue agent’s report “rar” for the remaining unresolved items we do not agree with the adjustments in the rar and we have filed a protest to initiate the administrative appeals process the proposed adjustments are primarily related to transfer pricing and could have a significant impact on our financial statements if not resolved favorably however we believe our existing reserves are adequate we do not believe it is reasonably possible that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits will significantly increase or decrease within the next 12 months as we do not believe the appeals process will be concluded within the next 12 months we also continue to be subject to examination by the irs for tax years 2007 to 2010

our effective tax rates in fiscal years 2010 and 2009 were approximately 25 and 27 respectively in fiscal years 2010 and 2009 the reduction to the us federal statutory rate as a result of foreign earnings taxed at lower rates was 12 and 9 respectively reflecting the mix of us and international income before income taxes and the impact of changes in unrecognized tax benefits related to international income in fiscal years 2010 and 2009 foreign income before income taxes was 154 billion and 143 billion respectively 

financial condition 

cash cash equivalents and investments 

cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments totaled 528 billion as of june 30 2011 compared with 368 billion as of june 30 2010 equity and other investments were 109 billion as of june 30 2011 compared with 78 billion as of june 30 2010 our shortterm investments are primarily to facilitate liquidity and for capital preservation they consist predominantly of highly liquid investmentgrade fixedincome securities diversified among industries and individual issuers the investments are predominantly us dollardenominated securities but also include foreign currencydenominated securities in order to diversify risk our fixedincome investments are exposed to interest rate risk and credit risk the credit risk and average maturity of our fixedincome portfolio are managed to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain fixedincome indices the settlement risk related to these investments is insignificant given that the shortterm investments held are primarily highly liquid investmentgrade fixedincome securities while we own certain mortgagebacked and assetbacked fixedincome securities our portfolio as of june 30 2011 does not contain direct exposure to subprime mortgages or structured vehicles that derive their value from subprime collateral the majority of our mortgagebacked securities are collateralized by prime residential mortgages and carry a 100 principal and interest guarantee primarily from federal national mortgage association federal home loan mortgage corporation and government national mortgage association

of the cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments at june 30 2011 approximately 45 billion was held by our foreign subsidiaries and were subject to material repatriation tax effects the amount of cash and investments held by foreign subsidiaries subject to other restrictions on the free flow of funds primarily currency and other local regulatory was approximately 379 million as of june 30 2011 approximately 68 of the shortterm investments held by our foreign subsidiaries were invested in us government and agency securities approximately 12 were invested in corporate notes and bonds of us companies and 5 were invested in us mortgagebacked securities all of which are denominated in us dollars 

securities lending 

we lend certain fixedincome and equity securities to increase investment returns the loaned securities continue to be carried as investments on our balance sheet cash andor security interests are received as collateral for the loaned securities with the amount determined based upon the underlying security lent and the creditworthiness of the borrower cash received is recorded as an asset with a corresponding liability our securities lending payable balance was 12 billion as of june 30 2011 our average and maximum securities lending payable balances for the fiscal year were 16 billion and 33 billion respectively intrayear variances in the amount of securities loaned are mainly due to fluctuations in the demand for the securities 

valuation 

in general and where applicable we use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities to determine the fair value of our financial instruments this pricing methodology applies to our level 1 investments such as exchangetraded mutual funds domestic and international equities and us treasuries if quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities are not available to determine fair value then we use quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities or inputs other than the quoted prices that are observable either directly or indirectly this pricing methodology applies to our level 2 investments such as corporate notes and bonds foreign government bonds mortgagebacked securities and agency securities level 3 investments are valued using internally developed models with unobservable inputs assets and liabilities measured using unobservable inputs are an immaterial portion of our portfolio 

a majority of our investments are priced by pricing vendors and are generally level 1 or level 2 investments as these vendors either provide a quoted market price in an active market or use observable inputs for their pricing without applying significant adjustments broker pricing is used mainly when a quoted price is not available the investment is not priced by our pricing vendors or when a broker price is more reflective of fair values in the market in which the investment trades our brokerpriced investments are generally labeled as level 2 investments because the broker prices these investments based on similar assets without applying significant adjustments in addition all of our brokerpriced investments have a sufficient level of trading volume to demonstrate that the fair values used are appropriate for these investments our fair value processes include controls that are designed to ensure appropriate fair values are recorded these controls include model validation review of key model inputs analysis of periodoverperiod fluctuations and independent recalculation of prices where appropriate 

cash flows 

fiscal year 2011 compared with fiscal year 2010 

cash flows from operations increased 29 billion during the current fiscal year to 270 billion due mainly to increased revenue and cash collections from customers cash used in financing decreased 49 billion to 84 billion due mainly to a 58 billion increase in proceeds from issuance of debt net of repayments offset in part by a 602 million increase in cash paid for dividends cash used in investing increased 33 billion to 146 billion due to a 58 billion increase in purchases of investments offset in part by a 25 billion increase in cash from securities lending 

fiscal year 2010 compared with fiscal year 2009 

cash flow from operations increased 50 billion primarily due to payment of 41 billion to the internal revenue service in the prior year as a result of our settlement of the 20002003 audit examination along with increased cash received from customers in the current year cash used for financing increased 58 billion primarily due to a 56

billion decrease in net cash proceeds from issuance and repayments of shortterm and longterm debt financing activities also included a 19 billion increase in cash used for common stock repurchases which was offset in part by a 17 billion increase in cash received from common stock issued cash used for investing decreased 45 billion due to a 33 billion decrease in cash used for combined investment purchases sales and maturities along with a 11 billion decrease in additions to property and equipment 

debt 

shortterm debt 

during fiscal year 2011 we repaid 10 billion of commercial paper leaving zero outstanding 

on november 5 2010 our 10 billion 364day credit facility expired this facility served as a backup for our commercial paper program no amounts were drawn against the credit facility during any of the periods presented 

longterm debt 

we issued debt during the periods presented to take advantage of favorable pricing and liquidity in the debt markets reflecting our superior credit rating and the low interest rate environment the proceeds of these issuances were used to partially fund discretionary business acquisitions and share repurchases 

as of june 30 2011 the total carrying value and estimated fair value of our longterm debt including convertible debt were 119 billion and 121 billion respectively this is compared to a carrying value and estimated fair value of 49 billion and 52 billion respectively as of june 30 2010 the estimated fair value is based on quoted prices for our publiclytraded debt as of june 30 2011 and 2010 as applicable 

the components of longterm debt the associated interest rates and the semiannual interest record and payment dates were as follows as of june 30 2011 

 

 notes 

the notes are senior unsecured obligations and rank equally with our other unsecured and unsubordinated debt outstanding 

  

  

part ii 

item 7 

  

  

convertible debt 

in june 2010 we issued 125 billion of zero coupon convertible unsecured debt due on june 15 2013 in a private placement offering proceeds from the offering were 124 billion net of fees and expenses which were capitalized each 1000 principal amount of notes is convertible into 2994 shares of microsoft common stock at a conversion price of 3340 per share as of june 30 2011 the net carrying amount of our convertible debt was 12 billion and the unamortized discount was 38 million 

prior to march 15 2013 the notes will be convertible only in certain circumstances into cash and if applicable cash shares of microsoft’s common stock or a combination thereof at our election on or after march 15 2013 the notes will be convertible at any time upon conversion we will pay cash up to the aggregate principal amount of the notes and pay or deliver cash shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock at our election 

because the convertible debt may be wholly or partially settled in cash we are required to separately account for the liability and equity components of the notes in a manner that reflects our nonconvertible debt borrowing rate when interest costs are recognized in subsequent periods the net proceeds of 124 billion were allocated between debt for 118 billion and stockholders’ equity for 58 million with the portion in stockholders’ equity representing the fair value of the option to convert the debt 

in connection with the issuance of the notes we entered into capped call transactions with certain option counterparties who are initial purchasers of the notes or their affiliates the capped call transactions are expected to reduce potential dilution of earnings per share upon conversion of the notes under the capped call transactions we purchased from the option counterparties capped call options that in the aggregate relate to the total number of shares of our common stock underlying the notes with a strike price equal to the conversion price of the notes and with a cap price equal to 3716 the purchased capped calls were valued at 40 million and recorded to stockholders’ equity 

unearned revenue 

unearned revenue at june 30 2011 comprised mainly unearned revenue from volume licensing programs unearned revenue from volume licensing programs represents customer billings for multiyear licensing arrangements paid for either at inception of the agreement or annually at the beginning of each billing coverage period and accounted for as subscriptions with revenue recognized ratably over the billing coverage period unearned revenue at june 30 2011 also included payments for postdelivery support and consulting services to be performed in the future xbox live subscriptions and prepaid points microsoft dynamics business solutions products oem minimum commitments unspecified upgradesenhancements of windows phone and microsoft internet explorer on a whenandifavailable basis for windows xp and other offerings for which we have been paid in advance and earn the revenue when we provide the service or software or otherwise meet the revenue recognition criteria

share repurchases 

on september 22 2008 we announced the completion of the two repurchase programs approved by our board of directors during the first quarter of fiscal year 2007 the “2007 programs” to buy back up to 400 billion of microsoft common stock on september 22 2008 we also announced that our board of directors approved a new share repurchase program authorizing up to 400 billion in share repurchases with an expiration date of september 30 2013 the “2008 program” as of june 30 2011 approximately 122 billion remained of the 400 billion approved repurchase amount the repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time without notice 

during the periods reported we repurchased with cash resources 447 million shares for 115 billion during fiscal year 2011 380 million shares for 108 billion during fiscal year 2010 and 318 million shares for 82 billion during fiscal year 2009 all shares repurchased in fiscal years 2011 and 2010 were repurchased under the 2008 program of the shares repurchased in fiscal year 2009 101 million shares were repurchased for 27 billion under the 2007 programs while the remainder was repurchased under the 2008 program 

dividends 

during fiscal years 2011 and 2010 our board of directors declared the following dividends 

 

 offbalance sheet arrangements 

we provide indemnifications of varying scope and size to certain customers against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products and certain other matters in evaluating estimated losses on these indemnifications we consider factors such as the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and our ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss to date we have not encountered significant costs as a result of these obligations and have not accrued in our financial statements any liabilities related to these indemnifications

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes the payments due by fiscal year for our outstanding contractual obligations as of june 30 2011 

 

  

     other planned uses of capital 

we will continue to invest in sales marketing product support infrastructure and existing and advanced areas of technology additions to property and equipment will continue including new facilities data centers and computer systems for research and development sales and marketing support and administrative staff we have operating leases for most us and international sales and support offices and certain equipment we have not engaged in any related party transactions or arrangements with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect liquidity or the availability of capital resources 

definitive agreement with skype 

on may 10 2011 we announced that we had entered into a definitive agreement with skype global sàrl “skype” under which we would acquire skype a leading internet communications company for 85 billion in cash we anticipate the acquisition will extend skype’s brand and reach of its network platform while enhancing our existing portfolio of realtime communications products and services the acquisition is subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions we obtained regulatory approval in the us and expect to obtain all remaining required regulatory approvals during calendar year 2011 

liquidity 

we earn a significant amount of our operating income outside the us which is deemed to be permanently reinvested in foreign jurisdictions as a result as discussed above under cash cash equivalents and investments the majority of our cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments are held by foreign subsidiaries we currently do not intend nor foresee a need to repatriate these funds we expect existing domestic cash cash equivalents 

  

  

part ii 

item 7 

  

  

shortterm investments and cash flows from operations to continue to be sufficient to fund our domestic operating activities and cash commitments for investing and financing activities such as regular quarterly dividends debt repayment schedules and material capital expenditures for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future in addition we expect existing foreign cash cash equivalents shortterm investments and cash flows from operations to continue to be sufficient to fund our foreign operating activities and cash commitments for investing activities such as material capital expenditures for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future 

should we require more capital in the us than is generated by our operations domestically for example to fund significant discretionary activities such as acquisitions of businesses and share repurchases we could elect to repatriate future earnings from foreign jurisdictions or raise capital in the us through debt or equity issuances these alternatives could result in higher effective tax rates increased interest expense or other dilution of our earnings we have borrowed funds domestically and continue to have the ability to borrow funds domestically at reasonable interest rates 

as a result of the special dividend paid in the second quarter of fiscal year 2005 and shares repurchased our retained deficit including accumulated other comprehensive income was 63 billion at june 30 2011 our retained deficit is not expected to affect our future ability to operate pay dividends or repay our debt given our continuing profitability and strong financial position 

recently issued accounting standards 

recently adopted accounting pronouncements 

on july 1 2010 we adopted guidance issued by the financial accounting standards board “fasb” on revenue recognition under the new guidance on arrangements that include software elements tangible products that have software components that are essential to the functionality of the tangible product are no longer within the scope of the software revenue recognition guidance and softwareenabled products are now subject to other relevant revenue recognition guidance additionally the fasb issued guidance on revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables that are outside the scope of the software revenue recognition guidance under the new guidance when vendor specific objective evidence or third party evidence for deliverables in an arrangement cannot be determined a best estimate of the selling price is required to separate deliverables and allocate arrangement consideration using the relative selling price method the new guidance includes new disclosure requirements on how the application of the relative selling price method affects the timing and amount of revenue recognition adoption of the new guidance did not have a material impact on our financial statements 

on july 1 2010 we adopted new guidance issued by the fasb on the consolidation of variable interest entities the new guidance requires revised evaluations of whether entities represent variable interest entities ongoing assessments of control over such entities and additional disclosures for variable interests adoption of the new guidance did not have a material impact on our financial statements 

recent accounting pronouncements not yet adopted 

in june 2011 the fasb issued guidance on presentation of comprehensive income the new guidance eliminates the current option to report other comprehensive income and its components in the statement of changes in equity instead an entity will be required to present either a continuous statement of net income and other comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements the new guidance will be effective for us beginning july 1 2012 and will have presentation changes only 

in may 2011 the fasb issued guidance to amend the accounting and disclosure requirements on fair value measurements the new guidance limits the highestandbestuse measure to nonfinancial assets permits certain financial assets and liabilities with offsetting positions in market or counterparty credit risks to be measured at a net basis and provides guidance on the applicability of premiums and discounts additionally the new guidance 

  

  

part ii 

item 7 

  

  

expands the disclosures on level 3 inputs by requiring quantitative disclosure of the unobservable inputs and assumptions as well as description of the valuation processes and the sensitivity of the fair value to changes in unobservable inputs the new guidance will be effective for us beginning january 1 2012 other than requiring additional disclosures we do not anticipate material impacts on our financial statements upon adoption 

in january 2010 the fasb issued guidance to amend the disclosure requirements related to fair value measurements the guidance requires the disclosure of roll forward activities on purchases sales issuance and settlements of the assets and liabilities measured using significant unobservable inputs level 3 fair value measurements the guidance will become effective for us with the reporting period beginning july 1 2011 other than requiring additional disclosures the adoption of this new guidance will not have a material impact on our financial statements 

application of critical accounting policies 

our financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states “us gaap” preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses these estimates and assumptions are affected by management’s application of accounting policies critical accounting policies for us include revenue recognition impairment of investment securities goodwill research and development costs contingencies income taxes and stockbased compensation 

revenue recognition 

software revenue recognition requires judgment including whether a software arrangement includes multiple elements and if so whether vendorspecific objective evidence “vsoe” of fair value exists for those elements a portion of revenue may be recorded as unearned due to undelivered elements changes to the elements in a software arrangement the ability to identify vsoe for those elements and the fair value of the respective elements could materially impact the amount of earned and unearned revenue judgment is also required to assess whether future releases of certain software represent new products or upgrades and enhancements to existing products 

impairment of investment securities 

investments are reviewed quarterly for indicators of otherthantemporary impairment this determination requires significant judgment in making this judgment we employ a systematic methodology quarterly that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments if the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value we evaluate among other factors general market conditions credit quality of debt instrument issuers the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost and for equity securities our intent and ability to hold or plans to sell the investment for fixedincome securities we also evaluate whether we have plans to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery we also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the investee including industry and sector performance changes in technology and operational and financing cash flow factors once a decline in fair value is determined to be otherthantemporary an impairment charge is recorded to other income expense and a new cost basis in the investment is established if market industry andor investee conditions deteriorate we may incur future impairments 

goodwill 

we allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the business combination we evaluate our reporting units on an annual basis and if necessary reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level operating segment or one level below an operating segment on an annual basis may 1 for us and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value these events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate legal factors operating performance indicators competition or sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit 

  

  

part ii 

item 7 

  

  

application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment including the identification of reporting units assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units assignment of goodwill to reporting units and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit the fair value of each reporting unit is estimated using a discounted cash flow methodology this analysis requires significant judgments including estimation of future cash flows which is dependent on internal forecasts estimation of the longterm rate of growth for our business estimation of the useful life over which cash flows will occur and determination of our weighted average cost of capital among our reporting units the fair value of osd has been the closest to its carrying value the carrying value of osd’s goodwill was 64 billion as of june 30 2011 

the estimates used to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit change from year to year based on operating results and market conditions changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and goodwill impairment for each reporting unit 

research and development costs 

costs incurred internally in researching and developing a computer software product are charged to expense until technological feasibility has been established for the product once technological feasibility is established all software costs are capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers judgment is required in determining when technological feasibility of a product is established we have determined that technological feasibility for our software products is reached after all highrisk development issues have been resolved through coding and testing generally this occurs shortly before the products are released to manufacturing the amortization of these costs is included in cost of revenue over the estimated life of the products 

legal and other contingencies 

the outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought against us are subject to significant uncertainty an estimated loss from a loss contingency such as a legal proceeding or claim is accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated disclosure of a contingency is required if there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss has been incurred in determining whether a loss should be accrued we evaluate among other factors the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss changes in these factors could materially impact our financial statements 

income taxes 

the objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity’s financial statements or tax returns we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement accounting literature also provides guidance on derecognition of income tax assets and liabilities classification of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities accounting for interest and penalties associated with tax positions and income tax disclosures judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our financial statements 

stockbased compensation 

stockbased compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period determining the fair value of stockbased awards at the grant date requires judgment including estimating expected dividends in addition judgment is also required in estimating the amount of stockbased awards that are expected to be forfeited if actual results differ significantly from these estimates stockbased compensation expense and our results of operations could be impacted

risks 

we are exposed to economic risk from foreign currency exchange rates interest rates credit risk equity prices and commodity prices a portion of these risks is hedged but they may impact our financial statements 

foreign currency 

certain forecasted transactions assets and liabilities are exposed to foreign currency risk we monitor our foreign currency exposures daily and use hedges where practicable to offset the risks and maximize the economic effectiveness of our foreign currency positions principal currencies hedged include the euro japanese yen british pound and canadian dollar 

interest rate 

our fixedincome portfolio is diversified across credit sectors and maturities consisting primarily of investmentgrade securities the credit risk and average maturity of the fixedincome portfolio is managed to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain global and domestic fixedincome indices in addition we use “to be announced” forward purchase commitments of mortgagebacked assets to gain exposure to agency and mortgagebacked securities 

equity 

our equity portfolio consists of global developed and emerging market securities that are subject to market price risk we manage the securities relative to certain global and domestic indices and expect their economic risk and return to correlate with these indices 

commodity 

we use broadbased commodity exposures to enhance portfolio returns and facilitate portfolio diversification our investment portfolio has exposure to a variety of commodities including precious metals energy and grain we manage these exposures relative to global commodity indices and expect their economic risk and return to correlate with these indices 

valueatrisk 

we use a valueatrisk “var” model to estimate and quantify our market risks var is the expected loss for a given confidence level in the fair value of our portfolio due to adverse market movements over a defined time horizon the var model is not intended to represent actual losses in fair value including determinations of otherthantemporary losses in fair value in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states “us gaap” but is used as a risk estimation and management tool the distribution of the potential changes in total market value of all holdings is computed based on the historical volatilities and correlations among foreign currency exchange rates interest rates equity prices and commodity prices assuming normal market conditions 

the var is calculated as the total loss that will not be exceeded at the 975 percentile confidence level or alternatively stated the losses could exceed the var in 25 out of 1000 cases several risk factors are not captured in the model including liquidity risk operational risk and legal risk

the following table sets forth the oneday var for substantially all of our positions as of june 30 2011 and 2010 and for the year ended june 30 2011 

 

 total oneday var for the combined risk categories was 290 million at june 30 2011 and 235 million at june 30 2010 the total var is 25 less at june 30 2011 and 26 less at june 30 2010 than the sum of the separate risk categories in the above table due to the diversification benefit of the combination of risks

microsoft business division 

microsoft business division “mbd” offerings consist of the microsoft office system and microsoft dynamics business solutions microsoft office system products are designed to increase personal team and organization productivity through a range of programs services and software solutions growth of revenue from the microsoft office system offerings which generate over 90 of mbd revenue depends on our ability to add value to the core office product set and to continue to expand our product offerings in other information worker areas such as content management enterprise search collaboration unified communications and business intelligence microsoft dynamics products provide business solutions for financial management customer relationship management “crm” supply chain management and analytics applications for small and midsize businesses large organizations and divisions of global enterprises 

approximately 80 of mbd revenue is generated from sales to businesses which includes microsoft office system revenue generated through volume licensing agreements and microsoft dynamics revenue revenue from this category generally depends upon the number of information workers in a licensed enterprise and is therefore relatively independent of the number of pcs sold in a given year approximately 20 of mbd revenue is derived from sales to consumers which includes revenue from retail packaged product sales and oem revenue this revenue is generally affected by the level of pc shipments and product launches 

products and services  microsoft office microsoft sharepoint and microsoft dynamics erp and crm as well as microsoft office web apps which are the online companions to microsoft word excel powerpoint and onenote

competition 

entertainment and devices businesses are highly competitive characterized by rapid product life cycles frequent introductions of new products and titles and the development of new technologies the markets for our products are characterized by significant price competition we anticipate continued pricing pressure from our competitors from time to time we have responded to this pressure by reducing prices on certain products our competitors vary in size from very small companies with limited resources to very large diversified corporations with substantial financial and marketing resources we compete primarily on the basis of product innovation quality and variety timing of product releases and effectiveness of distribution and marketing 

our xbox gaming and entertainment business competes with console platforms from nintendo and sony both of which have a large established base of customers the lifecycle for gaming and entertainment consoles averages five to 10 years we released xbox 360 our second generation console in november 2005 nintendo and sony released new versions of their game consoles in late 2006 we believe the success of gaming and entertainment consoles is determined by the availability of games for the console providing exclusive game content that gamers seek the computational power and reliability of the console and the ability to create new experiences via online services downloadable content and peripherals we think the xbox 360 is positioned well against competitive console products based on significant innovation in hardware architecture new developer tools online gaming services and continued strong exclusive content from our own game franchises in addition to competing against software published for nonxbox platforms our games business also competes with numerous companies that we have licensed to develop and publish software for the xbox consoles

operations 

to serve the needs of customers around the world and to improve the quality and usability of products in international markets we localize many of our products to reflect local languages and conventions localizing a product may require modifying the user interface altering dialog boxes and translating text 

our operational centers support all operations in their regions including customer contract and order processing credit and collections information processing and vendor management and logistics the regional center in ireland supports the european middle eastern and african region the center in singapore supports the japan greater china and asiapacific region and the centers in fargo north dakota fort lauderdale florida puerto rico redmond washington and reno nevada support latin america and north america in addition to the operational centers we also operate data centers throughout the united states and in europe 

we contract most of our manufacturing activities for xbox 360 and related games zune various retail software packaged products and microsoft hardware to third parties our products may include some components that are available from only one or limited sources our xbox 360 console includes certain key components that are supplied by a single source the integrated central processing unitgraphics processing unit is purchased from ibm and the supporting embedded dynamic random access memory chips are purchased from taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company although we have chosen to initially source these key xbox 360 components from a single supplier we are under no obligation to exclusively source components from these vendors in the future beyond the exceptions noted we generally have the ability to use other custom manufacturers if the current vendor becomes unavailable we generally have multiple sources for raw materials supplies and components and are often able to acquire component parts and materials on a volume discount basis 

research and development 

during fiscal years 2010 2009 and 2008 research and development expense was 87 billion 90 billion and 82 billion respectively these amounts represented 14 15 and 14 respectively of revenue in each of those years we plan to continue to make significant investments in a broad range of research and product development efforts 

while most of our software products are developed internally we also purchase technology license intellectual property rights and oversee thirdparty development and localization of certain products we believe we are not materially dependent upon licenses and other agreements with third parties relating to the development of our products internal development allows us to maintain closer technical control over our products it also gives us the freedom to decide which modifications and enhancements are most important and when they should be implemented generally we also create product documentation internally we strive to obtain information as early as possible about changing usage patterns and hardware advances that may affect software design before releasing new software platforms we provide application vendors with a range of resources and guidelines for development training and testing 

investing in business and product development 

innovation is the foundation for microsoft’s success our model for growth is based on our ability to initiate and embrace disruptive technology trends to enter new markets both in terms of geographies and product areas and to drive broad adoption of the products and services we develop and market we maintain our longterm commitment to research and development across a wide spectrum of technologies tools and platforms spanning communication and collaboration information access and organization entertainment business and ecommerce advertising and devices

increasingly we are taking a global approach to innovation while our main research and development facilities are located in the united states in redmond washington we also operate research and development facilities in other parts of the united states and around the world including canada china denmark england india ireland and israel this global approach will help us remain competitive in local markets and enable us to continue to attract top talent from across the world 

we invest in innovation by focusing on the emerging technology trends and breakthroughs that we believe offer significant opportunities to deliver value to our customers and growth for the company microsoft research is one of the world’s largest computer science research organizations and works in close collaboration with top universities around the world to advance the stateoftheart in computer science providing us a unique perspective on future technology trends 

based on our assessment of key technology trends and our broad focus on longterm research and development of new products and services areas where we see significant opportunities to drive future growth include 

cloud computing and software plus services 

the ability to combine the power of desktop and server software with the reach of the internet is creating important opportunities for growth in almost every one of our businesses accordingly we are focused on innovation and broadening our platform to develop a cloud computing ecosystem that positions us for success in areas including virtualization management and security identity we are also focused on delivering endtoend experiences that connect users to information communications entertainment and people in new ways across their lives at home at work and the broadest possible range of mobile scenarios through investments in datacenters new versions of windows and office that are designed to support a wide range of connected scenarios solutions for businesses that can be deployed by a customer by a service provider like microsoft or by a microsoft partner tools for developers and web designers and consumer products and services including xbox 360 xbox live windows live services and zune 

natural user interfaces 

the next few years will also see dramatic changes in the way people interact with technology as touch gestures handwriting and speech recognition become a normal part of how we control devices this will make technology more accessible and simpler to use and will create opportunities to reach new markets and deliver new kinds of computing experiences our longterm investments in natural user interfaces can be seen in products like windows 7 the microsoft auto software platform and kinect for xbox 360 we believe sensory input is just one aspect of natural user interface technology and we are researching the impact of several “interaction paradigms” such as contextual awareness and environmental awareness 

new scenario innovation in key industries 

continuing improvement in the power of computers and devices and the speed and ubiquity of networks is creating opportunities to deliver innovation that will transform a number of key industries and address significant global issues including healthcare environmental sustainability and education in healthcare for example computing will connect personal health information to medical research and help make healthcare more preventive personalized and costeffective today microsoft products such as healthvault and amalga help individuals manage their personal health and enable healthcare professionals to integrate research and health information so they can deliver more effective care we also believe that we are entering a period where personal computers will play an increasingly important role in virtually every field of scientific research and discovery

 challenges to our business models may reduce our revenues or operating margins whether our software runs in the cloud or on a device we continue to face challenges from alternative means of developing and licensing software under our licensebased software model software developers bear the costs of converting original ideas into software products through investments in research and development offsetting these costs with the revenue received from the distribution of their products certain “open source” software business models challenge our licensebased software model open source commonly refers to software whose source code is subject to a license allowing it to be modified combined with other software and redistributed subject to restrictions set forth in the license a number of commercial firms compete with us using an open source business model by modifying and then distributing open source software to end users at nominal cost and earning revenue on complementary services and products these firms do not bear the full costs of research and development for the software in some cases their products may infringe patents granted to microsoft for our inventions to the extent open source software gains increasing market acceptance our sales revenue and operating margins may decline 

an important element of our business model has been to create platformbased ecosystems on which many participants can build diverse solutions a competing verticallyintegrated model in which a single firm controls both the software and hardware elements of a product has been successful with certain consumer products such as personal computers mobile phones and digital music players we also offer verticallyintegrated hardware and software products however efforts to compete with the vertically integrated model may increase our cost of sales and reduce our operating margins 

we face intense competition we continue to experience intense competition across all markets for our products and services our competitors range in size from fortune 100 companies to small specialized singleproduct businesses and open source communitybased projects although we believe the breadth of our businesses and product portfolio is a competitive advantage our competitors that are focused on narrower product lines may be more effective in devoting technical marketing and financial resources to compete with us in addition barriers to entry in our businesses generally are low and products once developed can be distributed broadly and quickly at relatively low cost open source software vendors are devoting considerable efforts to developing software that mimics the features and functionality of our products in some cases in violation of our intellectual property rights or on the basis of technical specifications for microsoft technologies that we make available at little or no cost in

connection with our interoperability initiatives in response to competition we continue to develop versions of our products with basic functionality that are sold at lower prices than the standard versions these competitive pressures may result in decreased sales volumes price reductions andor increased operating costs such as for marketing and sales incentives resulting in lower revenue gross margins and operating income 

we may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property rights protecting our global intellectual property rights and combating unlicensed copying and use of software and other intellectual property is difficult while piracy adversely affects us revenue the impact on revenue from outside the us is more significant particularly in countries where laws are less protective of intellectual property rights as a result our revenue in these markets likely will grow slower than the underlying pc market similarly the absence of harmonized patent laws makes it more difficult to ensure consistent respect for patent rights throughout the world we actively educate consumers about the benefits of licensing genuine products and obtaining indemnification benefits for intellectual property risks and we educate lawmakers about the advantages of a business climate where intellectual property rights are protected however continued educational and enforcement efforts may fail to enhance revenue reductions in the legal protection for software intellectual property rights could adversely affect revenue 

third parties may claim we infringe their intellectual property rights from time to time we receive notices from others claiming we infringe their intellectual property rights the number of these claims may grow to resolve these claims we may enter into royalty and licensing agreements on less favorable terms stop selling or redesign affected products or pay damages to satisfy indemnification commitments with our customers such agreements may cause operating margins to decline we have made and expect to continue making significant expenditures to settle claims related to the use of technology and intellectual property rights as part of our strategy to manage this risk 

we may not be able to protect our source code from copying if there is an unauthorized disclosure of source code source code the detailed program commands for our operating systems and other software programs is critical to our business although we license portions of our application and operating system source code to a number of licensees we take significant measures to protect the secrecy of large portions of our source code if an unauthorized disclosure of a significant portion of our source code occurs we could potentially lose future trade secret protection for that source code this could make it easier for third parties to compete with our products by copying functionality which could adversely affect our revenue and operating margins unauthorized disclosure of source code also could increase the security risks described in the next paragraph 

security vulnerabilities in our products and services could lead to reduced revenues or to liability claims maintaining the security of computers and computer networks is a critical issue for us and our customers hackers develop and deploy viruses worms and other malicious software programs that attack our products and gain access to our networks and data centers although this is an industrywide problem that affects computers across all platforms it affects our products in particular because hackers tend to focus their efforts on the most popular operating systems and programs and we expect them to continue to do so we devote significant resources to address security vulnerabilities through 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 the cost of these steps could reduce our operating margins despite these efforts actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products could lead some customers to seek to return products to reduce or delay future

purchases or to use competing products customers may also increase their expenditures on protecting their existing computer systems from attack which could delay adoption of new technologies any of these actions by customers could adversely affect our revenue in addition if third parties gain access to our networks or data centers they could obtain and exploit confidential business information and harm our competitive position finally actual or perceived vulnerabilities may lead to claims against us although our license agreements typically contain provisions that eliminate or limit our exposure to such liability there is no assurance these provisions will withstand all legal challenges 

improper disclosure of personal data could result in liability and harm our reputation we store and process large amounts of personally identifiable information as we sell software provide support and offer cloudbased services to customers it is possible that our security controls over personal data our training of employees and vendors on data security and other practices we follow may not prevent the improper disclosure of personally identifiable information improper disclosure of this information could harm our reputation lead to legal exposure to customers or subject us to liability under laws that protect personal data resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue our software products and services also enable our customers to store and process personal data perceptions that our products or services do not adequately protect the privacy of personal information could inhibit sales of our products or services 

we may experience outages data loss and disruptions of our online services if we fail to maintain an adequate operations infrastructure our increasing user traffic and complexity of our products and services demand more computing power we have spent and expect to continue to spend substantial amounts to purchase or lease data centers and equipment and to upgrade our technology and network infrastructure to handle increased traffic on our web sites and in our data centers and to introduce new products and services and support existing services such as bing exchange online sharepoint online xbox live windows live and microsoft office web apps we also are growing our business of providing a platform and backend hosting for services provided by thirdparty businesses to their end customers maintaining and expanding this infrastructure is expensive and complex inefficiencies or operational failures including temporary or permanent loss of customer data could diminish the quality of our products services and user experience resulting in contractual liability claims by customers and other third parties damage to our reputation and loss of current and potential users subscribers and advertisers each of which may harm our operating results and financial condition 

we are subject to government litigation and regulatory activity that affects how we design and market our products as a leading global software maker we receive close scrutiny from government agencies under us and foreign competition laws some jurisdictions also provide private rights of action for competitors or consumers to assert claims of anticompetitive conduct for example we have been involved in the following actions 

lawsuits brought by the us department of justice 18 states and the district of columbia in two separate actions were resolved through a consent decree that took effect in 2001 and a final judgment entered in 2002 these proceedings imposed various constraints on our windows operating system businesses these constraints include limits on certain contracting practices mandated disclosure of certain software program interfaces and protocols and rights for computer manufacturers to limit the visibility of certain windows features in new pcs we believe we are in full compliance with these rules however if we fail to comply with them additional restrictions could be imposed on us that would adversely affect our business 

the european commission closely scrutinizes the design of highvolume microsoft products and the terms on which we make certain technologies used in these products such as file formats programming interfaces and protocols available to other companies in 2004 the commission ordered us to create new versions of windows that do not include certain multimedia technologies and to provide our competitors with specifications for how to implement certain proprietary windows communications protocols in their own products in 2009 the commission accepted a set of commitments offered by microsoft to address the commission’s concerns relating to competition in web browsing software the commission’s impact on product design may limit our ability to innovate in windows or other products in the future diminish the developer appeal of the windows platform and increase our product development costs the availability of licenses related to protocols and file formats may enable competitors to develop software products that better mimic the functionality of our own products which could result in decreased sales of our products

government regulatory actions and court decisions such as these may hinder our ability to provide the benefits of our software to consumers and businesses thereby reducing the attractiveness of our products and the revenues that come from them new actions could be initiated at any time either by these or other governments or private claimants including with respect to new versions of windows or other microsoft products the outcome of such actions or steps taken to avoid them could adversely affect us in a variety of ways including 

 

  

  

 our software and services online offerings are subject to government regulation of the internet domestically and internationally in many areas including user privacy telecommunications data protection and online content the application of these laws and regulations to our business is often unclear and sometimes may conflict compliance with these regulations may involve significant costs or require changes in business practices that result in reduced revenue noncompliance could result in penalties being imposed on us or orders that we stop the alleged noncompliant activity 

our business depends on our ability to attract and retain talented employees our business is based on successfully attracting and retaining talented employees the market for highly skilled workers and leaders in our industry is extremely competitive we are limited in our ability to recruit internationally by restrictive domestic immigration laws if we are less successful in our recruiting efforts or if we are unable to retain key employees our ability to develop and deliver successful products and services may be adversely affected effective succession planning is also important to our longterm success failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution 

delays in product development schedules may adversely affect our revenues the development of software products is a complex and timeconsuming process new products and enhancements to existing products can require long development and testing periods our increasing focus on cloudbased software plus services also presents new and complex development issues significant delays in new product or service releases or significant problems in creating new products or services could adversely affect our revenue 

we make significant investments in new products and services that may not be profitable our growth depends on our ability to innovate by offering new and adding value to our existing software and service offerings we will continue to make significant investments in research development and marketing for new products services and technologies including the windows pc operating system the microsoft office system xbox 360 bing windows server zune windows live the windows azure services platform and other cloudbased services offerings investments in new technology are speculative commercial success depends on many factors including innovativeness developer support and effective distribution and marketing our degree of success with windows phone for example will impact our ability to grow share of the smartphone operating system market it will also be an important factor in supporting our strategy of delivering value to end users seamlessly over pc phone and tv device classes if customers do not perceive our latest offerings as providing significant new functionality or other value they may reduce their purchases of new software products or upgrades unfavorably impacting revenue we may not achieve significant revenue from new product and service investments for a number of years if at all moreover new products and services may not be profitable and even if they are profitable operating margins for new products and businesses may not be as high as the margins we have experienced historically 

adverse economic conditions may harm our business unfavorable changes in economic conditions including inflation recession or other changes in economic conditions may result in lower information technology spending and adversely affect our revenue if demand for pcs servers and other computing devices declines or consumer or business spending for those products declines our revenue will be adversely affected our product distribution

system also relies on an extensive partner network the impact of economic conditions on our partners such as the bankruptcy of a major distributor could result in sales channel disruption challenging economic conditions also may impair the ability of our customers to pay for products and services they have purchased as a result reserves for doubtful accounts and writeoffs of accounts receivable may increase we maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings types and maturities these investments are subject to general credit liquidity market and interest rate risks which may be exacerbated by unusual events that have affected global financial markets if global credit and equity markets experience prolonged periods of decline our investment portfolio may be adversely impacted and we could determine that more of our investments have experienced an otherthantemporary decline in fair value requiring impairment charges that could adversely impact our financial results 

we have claims and lawsuits against us that may result in adverse outcomes we are subject to a variety of claims and lawsuits adverse outcomes in some or all of these claims may result in significant monetary damages or injunctive relief that could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business although management currently believes resolving all of these matters individually or in the aggregate will not have a material adverse impact on our financial statements the litigation and other claims are subject to inherent uncertainties and management’s view of these matters may change in the future a material adverse impact on our financial statements also could occur for the period in which the effect of an unfavorable final outcome becomes probable and reasonably estimable 

we may have additional tax liabilities we are subject to income taxes in the united states and many foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes in the ordinary course of our business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain we regularly are under audit by tax authorities although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals the results of an audit or litigation could have a material effect on our financial statements in the period or periods for which that determination is made 

we earn a significant amount of our operating income from outside the us and any repatriation of funds currently held in foreign jurisdictions may result in higher effective tax rates for the company in addition there have been proposals to change us tax laws that would significantly impact how us multinational corporations are taxed on foreign earnings although we cannot predict whether or in what form this proposed legislation will pass if enacted it could have a material adverse impact on our tax expense and cash flow 

our verticallyintegrated hardware and software products may experience quality or supply problems our hardware products such as the xbox 360 console are highly complex and can have defects in design manufacture or associated software we could incur significant expenses lost revenue and reputational harm if we fail to detect or effectively address such issues through design testing or warranty repairs we obtain some components of our hardware devices from sole suppliers if a component delivery from a solesource supplier is delayed or becomes unavailable or industry shortages occur we may be unable to obtain timely replacement supplies resulting in reduced sales either component shortages or excess or obsolete inventory may increase our cost of revenue xbox 360 consoles are assembled in asia disruptions in the supply chain may result in console shortages that would affect our revenues and operating margins these same risks would apply to any other verticallyintegrated hardware and software products we may offer 

if our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets become impaired we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states “us gaap” we review our amortizable intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually factors that may be considered a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets may not be recoverable include a decline in stock price and market capitalization reduced future cash flow estimates and slower growth rates in our industry we may be required to record a significant charge in our financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets is determined negatively impacting our results of operations 

we operate a global business that exposes us to additional risks we operate in over 100 countries and a significant part of our revenue comes from international sales pressure to make our pricing structure uniform might require that we reduce the sales price of our software in the united states and other countries operations outside

the united states may be affected by changes in trade protection laws policies and measures and other regulatory requirements affecting trade and investment including the foreign corrupt practices act and local laws prohibiting corrupt payments emerging markets are a significant focus of our international growth strategy the developing nature of these markets presents a number of risks deterioration of social political labor or economic conditions in a specific country or region and difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations may also adversely affect our operations or financial results although we hedge a portion of our international currency exposure significant fluctuations in exchange rates between the us dollar and foreign currencies may adversely affect our net revenues 

catastrophic events or geopolitical conditions may disrupt our business a disruption or failure of our systems or operations in the event of a major earthquake weather event cyberattack terrorist attack or other catastrophic event could cause delays in completing sales providing services or performing other missioncritical functions our corporate headquarters a significant portion of our research and development activities and certain other critical business operations are located in the seattle washington area and we have other business operations in the silicon valley area of california both of which are near major earthquake faults a catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our critical business or information technology systems could harm our ability to conduct normal business operations and our operating results abrupt political change terrorist activity and armed conflict pose a risk of general economic disruption in affected countries which may increase our operating costs these conditions also may add uncertainty to the timing and budget for technology investment decisions by our customers the longterm effects of climate change on the global economy in general or the information technology industry in particular are unclear environmental regulations or changes in the supply demand or available sources of energy may affect the availability or cost of goods and services including natural resources necessary to run our business changes in weather where we operate may increase the costs of powering and cooling computer hardware we use to develop software and provide cloudbased services new regulations may require us to find alternative compliant and costeffective methods of distributing our products and services 

acquisitions and joint ventures may have an adverse effect on our business we expect to continue making acquisitions or entering into joint ventures as part of our longterm business strategy these transactions involve significant challenges and risks including that the transaction does not advance our business strategy that we don’t realize a satisfactory return on our investment or that we experience difficulty in the integration of new employees business systems and technology or diversion of management’s attention from our other businesses these events could harm our operating results or financial condition

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

overview and outlook 

the following management’s discussion and analysis “mda” is intended to help the reader understand the results of operations and financial condition of microsoft corporation mda is provided as a supplement to and should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the accompanying notes to the financial statements “notes” we generate revenue by developing manufacturing licensing and supporting a wide range of software products and services for many different types of computing devices our software products and services include operating systems for personal computers servers and intelligent devices server applications for distributed computing environments information worker productivity applications business solutions applications highperformance computing applications software development tools and video games we provide consulting and product and solution support services and we train and certify computer system integrators and developers we also design and sell hardware including the xbox 360 gaming and entertainment console and accessories the zune digital music and entertainment device and accessories and microsoft pc hardware products online offerings and information are delivered to consumers through bing windows live microsoft office web apps our msn portals and channels and to businesses through microsoft online services offerings such as microsoft dynamics crm online exchange online windows azure sql azure and sharepoint online we enable the delivery of online advertising across our broad range of digital media properties and on bing through our proprietary adcenter platform 

our revenue historically has fluctuated quarterly and has generally been the highest in the second quarter of our fiscal year due to corporate calendar yearend spending trends in our major markets and holiday season spending by consumers our entertainment and devices division is particularly seasonal as its products are aimed at the consumer market and are in highest demand during the holiday shopping season typically the entertainment and devices division has generated approximately 40 of its annual segment revenues in our second fiscal quarter in addition quarterly revenues may be impacted by the deferral of revenue see the discussions below regarding the deferral of revenue related to eligible sales of the 2007 microsoft office system with a guarantee to be upgraded to the 2010 microsoft office system at minimal or no cost the “office 2010 deferral” and sales of windows vista with a guarantee to be upgraded to windows 7 at minimal or no cost and of windows 7 to original equipment manufacturers and retailers before general availability the “windows 7 deferral” 

global macroeconomic factors have a strong correlation to demand for our software services hardware and online offerings the unfavorable global economic environment adversely affected our business in fiscal year 2009 as consumers and businesses cut back on spending which reduced pc shipments and it investments during fiscal year 2010 the environment began to improve however the current macroeconomic factors remain dynamic and uncertain and are likely to remain so into 2011 irrespective of global economic conditions we are positive about our relative market position our current product portfolio and future product pipeline because we offer a wide range of products and services that enable companies to improve productivity and reduce costs including cloudbased services we believe that microsoft is wellpositioned to create new opportunities to increase revenue as the global economy improves we remain focused on executing in the areas we can control by continuing to provide high value products at the lowest total cost of ownership while managing our expenses 

technological innovation is the foundation of our longterm growth and we intend to maintain our commitment to investment in research and development engineering excellence and delivering highquality products and services to customers and partners we continue to develop innovative software applications and solutions that we believe will enhance information worker productivity improve communication and collaboration in work groups aid business intelligence and streamline processes for small and midsized businesses to sustain growth in the face of competition from other vendors of proprietary and open source software our goal is to deliver products that provide the best platform for network computing – software that is easiest to deploy and manage and that is most secure – with the lowest total cost of ownership

in addition we continue to invest in research and development in existing and new lines of business including cloud computing search online solutions business solutions mobile computing communication entertainment and other areas that we believe may contribute to our longterm growth we also invest in research and development of advanced technologies for future software products we believe that delivering innovative and highvalue solutions through our integrated platform is the key to meeting customer needs and to our future growth 

this longterm focus on investment in research and development has enabled us to lay a foundation for future growth by delivering innovative products creating opportunities for partners and improving customer satisfaction our focus in fiscal year 2011 is to build on this foundation and to continue to execute well in key areas through ongoing innovation on our integrated software platform by responding effectively to customer and partner needs and by focusing internally on product excellence business efficacy and accountability across the company 

summary of results for fiscal years 2010 2009 and 2008 

 

 fiscal year 2010 compared with fiscal year 2009 

revenue increased mainly due to strong sales of windows 7 which was released during fiscal year 2010 and pc market improvement operating income increased reflecting the change in revenue offset in part by higher operating expenses 

 

  

  

  

 diluted earnings per share increased reflecting increased net income and the repurchase of 380 million shares during fiscal year 2010 

fiscal year 2009 compared with fiscal year 2008 

revenue declined across most segments primarily driven by weakness in the global pc market and the unfavorable economic environment primary factors contributing to the decline include the following 

 

  

   

  

part ii 

item 7 

  

  

the above declines were partially offset by increased server and server application revenue reflecting recognition of deferred revenue from previously signed agreements and continued adoption of the windows server platform and applications through sql server enterprise cal suites and system center products foreign currency exchange rates had a favorable impact of 486 million on revenue 

operating income decreased primarily reflecting decreased revenue operating expenses were flat with decreased general and administrative and sales and marketing expenses offset by increased headcountrelated expenses cost of revenue and employee severance charges 

 

  

  

  

 in january 2009 we announced and implemented a resource management program to reduce discretionary operating expenses employee headcount and capital expenditures as part of this program we announced the elimination of up to 5000 positions in research and development marketing sales finance legal human resources and information technology by june 30 2010 during fiscal year 2009 we recorded employee severance charges of 330 million for the expected reduction in employee headcount 

diluted earnings per share declined primarily reflecting decreased net income partially offset by share repurchases during the prior 12 months we repurchased 318 million shares during fiscal year 2009

windows division revenue growth is largely correlated to the growth of pc purchases from original equipment manufacturers “oems” that preinstall versions of windows operating systems because the oem channel accounts for approximately 80 of total windows division revenue the remaining approximately 20 of windows division revenue “other revenue” is generated by commercial and retail sales of windows and online advertising from windows live 

fiscal year 2010 compared with fiscal year 2009 

windows division revenue increased primarily as a result of strong sales of windows 7 and pc market improvement we estimate total pc shipments from all sources grew approximately 16 to 18 oem revenue increased 26 billion or 22 while oem license units increased 21 the oem revenue increase was driven by pc market growth higher windows attach rates across consumer and business segments the restoration of normal oem inventory levels and the mix of versions of windows licensed offset in part by pc market changes including stronger growth of emerging markets versus developed markets and of consumer pcs versus business pcs fiscal year 2009 oem revenue reflects a 273 million windows 7 deferral as discussed under overview and outlook above this amount was subsequently recognized in fiscal year 2010 other revenue increased 912 million or 29 driven primarily by windows 7 retail sales 

windows division operating income increased as a result of increased revenue offset in part by higher operating expenses cost of revenue increased 296 million or 22 primarily driven by royalties and other product costs sales and marketing expenses increased 256 million or 11 reflecting increased advertising and marketing of windows 7 

fiscal year 2009 compared with fiscal year 2008 

windows division revenue decreased primarily as a result of pc market weakness especially pcs sold to businesses oem revenue decreased 23 billion or 16 while oem license units declined 2 based on our estimates total worldwide pc shipments from all sources experienced a decline of approximately 1 to growth of approximately 2 driven by changes in demand in emerging and developed markets 

windows division operating income decreased primarily reflecting decreased revenue and increased sales and marketing expenses sales and marketing expenses increased 100 million or 5 primarily reflecting increased advertising and marketing

fiscal year 2010 compared with fiscal year 2009 

server and tools revenue increased mainly reflecting growth in product revenue product revenue increased 652 million or 6 driven primarily by growth in windows server sql server and enterprise cal suites revenue reflecting increased revenue from annuity volume licensing agreements and continued adoption of windows platform applications offset in part by a decline in developer tools revenue enterprise services revenue was relatively flat with growth in premier product support services nearly offset by decreased consulting services 

server and tools operating income increased due mainly to revenue growth and reduced research and development expenses offset in part by increased cost of revenue research and development expenses decreased 38 million or 2 primarily driven by reduced thirdparty development and programming costs and headcountrelated expenses offset in part by increased hosting localization and lab costs cost of revenue increased 25 million 

fiscal year 2009 compared with fiscal year 2008

other income expense and income taxes 

other income expense 

the components of other income expense were as follows 

 

  

 we use derivative instruments to manage risks related to foreign currencies equity prices interest rates and credit to enhance investment returns and to facilitate portfolio diversification gains and losses from changes in fair values of derivatives that are not designated as hedges are recognized in other income expense these are generally offset by unrealized gains and losses in the underlying securities in the investment portfolio and are recorded as a component of other comprehensive income 

fiscal year 2010 compared with fiscal year 2009 

dividends and interest income increased primarily due to higher average portfolio investment balances offset in part by lower yields on our fixedincome investments interest expense increased due to our issuance of long term debt in may 2009 net recognized gains on investments increased primarily due to lower otherthantemporary impairments offset in part by lower gains on sales of investments in the current period otherthantemporary impairments were 69 million during fiscal year 2010 as compared with 862 million during fiscal year 2009 and decreased primarily due to improvements in market conditions net losses on derivatives decreased due to gains on equity and interest rate derivatives as compared to losses in the prior period and lower losses on commodity and foreign currency contracts in the current period net gains from foreign currency remeasurements were insignificant in fiscal year 2010 compared to net losses of 509 million in the prior year which had resulted from the strengthening of the us dollar in the prior year for fiscal year 2010 other includes a gain on the divestiture of razorfish 

  

  

part ii 

item 7 

  

  

fiscal year 2009 compared with fiscal year 2008 

dividends and interest income decreased primarily reflecting lower interest rates on our fixedincome investments interest expense decreased due to lower average collateral balances on loaned securities and related rates net recognized losses on investments increased primarily due to higher otherthantemporary impairments that were partially offset by gains on sales of certain equity investments held in our strategic investments portfolio otherthan temporary impairments were 862 million during fiscal year 2009 as compared with 312 million during fiscal year 2008 and increased primarily due to declines in equity values as a result of deterioration in equity markets net losses on derivatives increased primarily due to losses on equity commodity and interest rate derivatives in fiscal year 2009 as compared with gains in the prior period net losses on foreign currency remeasurements increased due to the strengthening of the us dollar particularly in the first half of the fiscal year 2009 

income taxes 

fiscal year 2010 compared with fiscal year 2009 

our effective tax rates in fiscal years 2010 and 2009 were 25 and 27 respectively the fiscal year 2010 rate reflects a higher mix of foreign earnings taxed at lower rates 

fiscal year 2009 compared with fiscal year 2008 

our effective tax rates in fiscal years 2009 and 2008 were 27 and 26 respectively while the fiscal year 2009 rate reflects a higher mix of foreign earnings taxed at lower rates the rate increased from the prior year because the fiscal year 2008 rate reflects the resolution of tax positions relating to our agreement with the internal revenue service “irs” settling the 20002003 examination partially offset by the european commission fine which was not tax deductible as a result of the settlement and the impact on subsequent years we paid the irs approximately 41 billion during fiscal year 2009 

financial condition 

cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments totaled 368 billion as of june 30 2010 compared with 314 billion as of june 30 2009 equity and other investments were 78 billion as of june 30 2010 compared with 49 billion as of june 30 2009 our shortterm investments are primarily to facilitate liquidity and for capital preservation they consist predominantly of investment grade fixedincome securities diversified among industries and individual issuers the investments are predominantly us dollardenominated securities but also include foreign currencydenominated securities in order to diversify risk 

in general and where applicable we use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities to determine fair value this pricing methodology applies to our level 1 investments such as exchangetraded mutual funds domestic and international equities and us treasuries if quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities are not available to determine fair value then we use quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities or inputs other than the quoted prices that are observable either directly or indirectly this pricing methodology applies to our level 2 investments such as corporate notes and bonds foreign government bonds mortgagebacked securities and agency securities level 3 investments are valued using internally developed models with unobservable inputs assets and liabilities measured using unobservable inputs are an immaterial portion of our portfolio 

a majority of our investments are priced by pricing vendors and are generally level 1 or level 2 investments as these vendors either provide a quoted market price in an active market or use observable inputs for their pricing without applying significant adjustments broker pricing is used mainly when a quoted price is not available the investment is not priced by our pricing vendors or when a broker price is more reflective of fair values in the market in which the investment trades our brokerpriced investments are generally labeled as level 2 investments because the broker prices these investments based on similar assets without applying significant adjustments in addition all 

  

  

part ii 

item 7 

  

  

of our brokerpriced investments have a sufficient level of trading volume to demonstrate that the fair values used are appropriate for these investments our fair value processes include controls that are designed to ensure appropriate fair values are recorded these controls include model validation review of key model inputs analysis of periodoverperiod fluctuations and independent recalculation of prices where appropriate 

while we own certain mortgagebacked and assetbacked fixedincome securities our portfolio as of june 30 2010 does not contain direct exposure to subprime mortgages or structured vehicles that derive their value from subprime collateral the majority of the mortgagebacked securities are collateralized by prime residential mortgages and carry a 100 principal and interest guarantee primarily from federal national mortgage association federal home loan mortgage corporation and government national mortgage association 

we lend certain fixedincome and equity securities to increase investment returns the loaned securities continue to be carried as investments on our balance sheet cash andor security interests are received as collateral for the loaned securities with the amount determined based upon the underlying security lent and the creditworthiness of the borrower cash received is recorded as an asset with a corresponding liability 

debt 

in september 2008 our board of directors authorized debt financings of up to 60 billion as of june 30 2010 we had 60 billion of issued and outstanding debt comprised of 10 billion of commercial paper and 50 billion of longterm debt including 125 billion of convertible debt 

shortterm debt 

as of june 30 2010 our 10 billion of commercial paper issued and outstanding had a weighted average interest rate including issuance costs of 020 and maturities of 22 to 216 days in november 2009 we replaced our 20 billion and 10 billion credit facilities with a 225 billion 364day credit facility which expires on november 5 2010 this facility serves as a backup for our commercial paper program in june 2010 we reduced the size of our credit facility from 225 billion to 10 billion due to the reduction in commercial paper outstanding as of june 30 2010 we were in compliance with the financial covenant in the credit facility agreement which requires a coverage ratio be maintained of at least three times earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization to interest expense no amounts were drawn against the credit facility during any of the periods presented 

longterm debt 

notes 

as of june 30 2010 we had issued and outstanding 375 billion of debt securities as follows 20 billion aggregate principal amount of 295 notes due 2014 10 billion aggregate principal amount of 420 notes due 2019 and 750 million aggregate principal amount of 520 notes due 2039 collectively “the notes” interest on the notes is payable semiannually on june 1 and december 1 of each year to holders of record on the preceding may 15 and november 15 the notes are senior unsecured obligations and rank equally with our other unsecured and unsubordinated debt outstanding 

convertible debt 

in june 2010 we issued 125 billion of zero coupon convertible unsecured debt due on june 15 2013 in a private placement offering proceeds from the offering were 124 billion net of fees and expenses which were capitalized the majority of the proceeds were used to repay outstanding commercial paper leaving 10 billion of commercial paper outstanding as of june 30 2010 each 1000 principal amount of notes is convertible into 2994 shares of microsoft common stock at a conversion price of 3340 per share 

  

  

part ii 

item 7 

  

  

prior to march 15 2013 the notes will be convertible only in certain circumstances into cash and if applicable cash shares of microsoft’s common stock or a combination thereof at our election on or after march 15 2013 the notes will be convertible at any time upon conversion we will pay cash up to the aggregate principal amount of the notes and pay or deliver cash shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock at our election 

because the convertible debt may be wholly or partially settled in cash we are required to separately account for the liability and equity components of the notes in a manner that reflects our nonconvertible debt borrowing rate when interest costs are recognized in subsequent periods the net proceeds of 124 billion were allocated between debt for 118 billion and stockholders’ equity for 58 million with the portion in stockholders’ equity representing the fair value of the option to convert the debt 

in connection with the issuance of the notes we entered into capped call transactions with certain option counterparties who are initial purchasers of the notes or their affiliates the capped call transactions are expected to reduce potential dilution of earnings per share upon conversion of the notes under the capped call transactions we purchased from the option counterparties capped call options that in the aggregate relate to the total number of shares of our common stock underlying the notes with a strike price equal to the conversion price of the notes and with a cap price initially equal to 3716 the purchased capped calls were valued at 40 million and were charged to stockholders’ equity 

unearned revenue 

unearned revenue at june 30 2010 comprised mainly unearned revenue from volume licensing programs unearned revenue from volume licensing programs represents customer billings for multiyear licensing arrangements paid for either at inception of the agreement or annually at the beginning of each billing coverage period and accounted for as subscriptions with revenue recognized ratably over the billing coverage period unearned revenue at june 30 2010 also included payments for postdelivery support and consulting services to be performed in the future xbox live subscriptions unspecified upgradesenhancements of microsoft internet explorer on a whenandifavailable basis for windows xp microsoft dynamics business solutions products technology guarantee programs including the 2010 microsoft office technology guarantee program and other offerings for which we have been paid in advance and earn the revenue when we provide the service or software or otherwise meet the revenue recognition criteria 

the following table outlines the expected future recognition of unearned revenue as of june 30 2010 

 

 cash flows 

fiscal year 2010 compared with fiscal year 2009 

cash flow from operations increased 50 billion primarily due to payment of 41 billion to the internal revenue service in the prior year as a result of our settlement of the 20002003 audit examination along with increased cash received from customers in the current year cash used for financing increased 58 billion primarily due to a 56 billion decrease in net cash proceeds from issuance and repayments of shortterm and longterm debt financing activities also included a 19 billion increase in cash used for common stock repurchases which was offset in part 

  

  

part ii 

item 7 

  

  

by a 17 billion increase in cash received from common stock issued cash used for investing decreased 45 billion due to a 33 billion decrease in cash used for combined investment purchases sales and maturities along with a 11 billion decrease in additions to property and equipment 

fiscal year 2009 compared with fiscal year 2008 

cash flow from operations decreased 26 billion due to payment of approximately 41 billion to the irs in connection with our settlement of the 20002003 audit examination this impact was partially offset by the fiscal year 2008 payment of the 14 billion  € 899 million european commission fine cash used for financing decreased 55 billion primarily due to 57 billion of net cash proceeds from issuance of shortterm and longterm debt in fiscal year 2009 financing activities also included a 32 billion decrease in common stock repurchased which was offset by a 29 billion decline in common stock issued cash used for investing increased 112 billion due to a 159 billion rise in purchases of investments along with a 17 billion decrease in cash from investment sales and maturities these impacts were partially offset by a 72 billion decrease in cash paid for acquisition of companies including the purchase of aquantive in fiscal year 2008 

share repurchases 

on september 22 2008 we announced the completion of the two repurchase programs approved by our board of directors during the first quarter of fiscal year 2007 the “2007 programs” to buy back up to 400 billion of microsoft common stock on september 22 2008 we also announced that our board of directors approved a new share repurchase program authorizing up to 400 billion in share repurchases with an expiration date of september 30 2013 the “2008 program” as of june 30 2010 approximately 237 billion remained of the 400 billion approved repurchase amount the repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time without notice

 offbalance sheet arrangements 

we provide indemnifications of varying scope and size to certain customers against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products and certain other matters in evaluating 

  

  

part ii 

item 7 

  

  

estimated losses on these indemnifications we consider factors such as the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and our ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss to date we have not encountered significant costs as a result of these obligations and have not accrued any liabilities related to these indemnifications in our financial statements 

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes the payments due by fiscal year for our outstanding contractual obligations as of june 30 2010 we expect to fund these commitments with existing cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments and cash flows from operations 

 

  

     other planned uses of capital 

we will continue to invest in sales marketing product support infrastructure and existing and advanced areas of technology additions to property and equipment will continue including new facilities data centers and computer systems for research and development sales and marketing support and administrative staff we have operating leases for most us and international sales and support offices and certain equipment we have not engaged in any related party transactions or arrangements with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect liquidity or the availability of capital resources 

we believe existing cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments together with funds generated from operations should be sufficient to meet operating requirements regular quarterly dividends debt repayment schedules and share repurchases our philosophy regarding the maintenance of a balance sheet with a large component of cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments and equity and other investments reflects our views on potential future capital requirements relating to research and development creation and expansion of sales distribution channels investments and acquisitions share dilution management legal risks and challenges to our business model we regularly assess our investment management approach in view of our current and potential future needs

item 7 

  

  

as a result of the special dividend paid in the second quarter of fiscal year 2005 and shares repurchased our retained deficit including accumulated other comprehensive income was 167 billion at june 30 2010 our retained deficit is not expected to affect our future ability to operate pay dividends or repay our debt given our continuing profitability and strong cash and financial position 

recent legislation 

in march 2010 the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010 were signed into law in the united states this legislation expands health care coverage to many uninsured individuals and expands coverage to those already insured the changes required by this legislation will largely be funded through tax increases to both insurers and the insured we do not expect any near term impact on our financial results as a result of the legislation one provision that will impact certain companies significantly is the elimination of the tax deductibility of the medicare part d subsidy this provision does not affect us because we do not provide retiree health benefits 

recently issued accounting standards 

recently adopted accounting pronouncements 

in january 2010 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued guidance to amend the disclosure requirements related to recurring and nonrecurring fair value measurements the guidance requires new disclosures on the transfers of assets and liabilities between level 1 quoted prices in active market for identical assets or liabilities and level 2 significant other observable inputs of the fair value measurement hierarchy including the reasons and the timing of the transfers additionally the guidance requires a roll forward of activities on purchases sales issuance and settlements of the assets and liabilities measured using significant unobservable inputs level 3 fair value measurements the guidance became effective for us with the reporting period beginning january 1 2010 except for the disclosure on the roll forward activities for level 3 fair value measurements which will become effective for us with the reporting period beginning july 1 2011 other than requiring additional disclosures adoption of this new guidance did not have a material impact on our financial statements 

on july 1 2009 we adopted guidance issued by the fasb on business combinations the guidance retains the fundamental requirements that the acquisition method of accounting previously referred to as the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations but requires a number of changes including changes in the way assets and liabilities are recognized and measured as a result of business combinations it also requires the capitalization of inprocess research and development at fair value and requires the expensing of acquisitionrelated costs as incurred we have applied this guidance to business combinations completed since july 1 2009 

on july 1 2009 we adopted guidance issued by the fasb that changes the accounting and reporting for noncontrolling interests noncontrolling interests are to be reported as a component of equity separate from the parent’s equity and purchases or sales of equity interests that do not result in a change in control are to be accounted for as equity transactions in addition net income attributable to a noncontrolling interest is to be included in net income and upon a loss of control the interest sold as well as any interest retained is to be recorded at fair value with any gain or loss recognized in net income adoption of the new guidance did not have a material impact on our financial statements 

on july 1 2009 we adopted guidance on fair value measurement for nonfinancial assets and liabilities except for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis at least annually adoption of the new guidance did not have a material impact on our financial statements 

recent accounting pronouncements not yet adopted 

in october 2009 the fasb issued guidance on revenue recognition that will become effective for us beginning july 1 2010 under the new guidance on arrangements that include software elements tangible products that have software components that are essential to the functionality of the tangible product will no longer be within the scope 

  

  

part ii 

item 7 

  

  

of the software revenue recognition guidance and softwareenabled products will now be subject to other relevant revenue recognition guidance additionally the fasb issued guidance on revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables that are outside the scope of the software revenue recognition guidance under the new guidance when vendor specific objective evidence or third party evidence for deliverables in an arrangement cannot be determined a best estimate of the selling price is required to separate deliverables and allocate arrangement consideration using the relative selling price method the new guidance includes new disclosure requirements on how the application of the relative selling price method affects the timing and amount of revenue recognition we believe adoption of this new guidance will not have a material impact on our financial statements 

in june 2009 the fasb issued guidance on the consolidation of variable interest entities which is effective for us beginning july 1 2010 the new guidance requires revised evaluations of whether entities represent variable interest entities ongoing assessments of control over such entities and additional disclosures for variable interests we believe adoption of this new guidance will not have a material impact on our financial statements 

application of critical accounting policies 

our financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states “us gaap” preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses these estimates and assumptions are affected by management’s application of accounting policies critical accounting policies for us include revenue recognition impairment of investment securities goodwill research and development costs contingencies income taxes stockbased compensation and product warranties 

revenue recognition 

software revenue recognition requires judgment including whether a software arrangement includes multiple elements and if so whether vendorspecific objective evidence “vsoe” of fair value exists for those elements a portion of revenue may be recorded as unearned due to undelivered elements the amount of revenue allocated to undelivered elements is based on the vsoe of fair value for those elements using the residual method or relative fair value method and the deferred revenue is recognized as the elements are delivered changes to the elements in a software arrangement the ability to identify vsoe for those elements the fair value of the respective elements and changes to a product’s estimated life cycle could materially impact the amount of earned and unearned revenue judgment is also required to assess whether future releases of certain software represent new products or upgrades and enhancements to existing products 

a portion of the revenue related to windows xp is recorded as unearned due to the right to receive unspecified upgradesenhancements of microsoft internet explorer on a whenandifavailable basis revenue related to windows vista and windows 7 is not subject to a similar deferral because there are no significant undelivered elements 2007 microsoft office system revenue is subject to deferral as a result of the 2010 microsoft office system technology guarantee program which started march 5 2010 this program allows customers who purchased certain versions of the 2007 microsoft office system to receive an upgrade to the corresponding version of the 2010 microsoft office system at minimal or no cost when the product becomes generally available accordingly estimated revenue related to the undelivered 2010 microsoft office system is deferred until the product is delivered 

impairment of investment securities 

investments are reviewed quarterly for indicators of otherthantemporary impairment this determination requires significant judgment in making this judgment we employ a systematic methodology quarterly that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments if the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value we evaluate among other factors general market conditions credit quality of debt instrument issuers the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost and for equity securities our intent and ability to hold or plans to sell the investment for fixed income securities we also evaluate whether we have plans to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery

we also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the investee including industry and sector performance changes in technology and operational and financing cash flow factors once a decline in fair value is determined to be otherthantemporary an impairment charge is recorded to other income expense and a new cost basis in the investment is established if market industry andor investee conditions deteriorate we may incur future impairments 

goodwill 

goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level operating segment or one level below an operating segment on an annual basis may 1 for us and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value these events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate legal factors operating performance indicators competition or sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment including the identification of reporting units assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units assignment of goodwill to reporting units and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit the fair value of each reporting unit is estimated using a discounted cash flow methodology this analysis requires significant judgments including estimation of future cash flows which is dependent on internal forecasts estimation of the longterm rate of growth for our business estimation of the useful life over which cash flows will occur and determination of our weighted average cost of capital changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and goodwill impairment for each reporting unit we allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the business combination we evaluate our reporting units on an annual basis and if necessary reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach 

in addition to the impairment test performed on may 1 2010 we performed an interim impairment analysis of our online services division goodwill balance during the first quarter of fiscal year 2010 in connection with the disposal of razorfish no impairment of goodwill was identified 

research and development costs 

costs incurred internally in researching and developing a computer software product are charged to expense until technological feasibility has been established for the product once technological feasibility is established all software costs are capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers judgment is required in determining when technological feasibility of a product is established we have determined that technological feasibility for our software products is reached after all highrisk development issues have been resolved through coding and testing generally this occurs shortly before the products are released to manufacturing the amortization of these costs is included in cost of revenue over the estimated life of the products 

legal and other contingencies 

the outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought against us are subject to significant uncertainty an estimated loss from a loss contingency such as a legal proceeding or claim is accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated disclosure of a contingency is required if there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss has been incurred in determining whether a loss should be accrued we evaluate among other factors the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss changes in these factors could materially impact our financial statements 

income taxes 

the objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity’s financial statements or tax returns we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax

position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement accounting literature also provides guidance on derecognition of income tax assets and liabilities classification of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities accounting for interest and penalties associated with tax positions and income tax disclosures judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our financial statements 

stockbased compensation 

stockbased compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period determining the fair value of stockbased awards at the grant date requires judgment including estimating expected dividends in addition judgment is also required in estimating the amount of stockbased awards that are expected to be forfeited if actual results differ significantly from these estimates stockbased compensation expense and our results of operations could be impacted 

product warranties 

we provide for the estimated costs of hardware and software warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized for hardware warranty we estimate the costs based on historical and projected product failure rates historical and projected repair costs and knowledge of specific product failures if any the specific hardware warranty terms and conditions vary depending upon the product sold and country in which we do business but generally include parts and labor over a period generally ranging from 90 days to three years for software warranty we estimate the costs to provide bug fixes such as security patches over the life of the software we regularly reevaluate our estimates to assess the adequacy of the recorded warranty liabilities and adjust the amounts as necessary

we use a valueatrisk “var” model to estimate and quantify our market risks var is the expected loss for a given confidence level in the fair value of our portfolio due to adverse market movements over a defined time horizon the var model is not intended to represent actual losses in fair value including determinations of otherthantemporary losses in fair value in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states “us gaap” but is used as a risk estimation and management tool the distribution of the potential changes in total market value of all holdings is computed based on the historical volatilities and correlations among foreign currency exchange rates interest rates equity prices and commodity prices assuming normal market conditions 

the var is calculated as the total loss that will not be exceeded at the 975 percentile confidence level or alternatively stated the losses could exceed the var in 25 out of 1000 cases several risk factors are not captured in the model including liquidity risk operational risk and legal risk

item 1 

  

  

due to our integrated business structure operating costs included in one segment may benefit other segments therefore these segments are not designed to measure operating income or loss that is directly related to the products and services included in each segment intersegment cost commissions are estimated by management and used to compensate or charge each segment for such shared costs and to motivate shared effort segments should not be viewed as discrete or easily separable businesses 

client 

client has overall responsibility for technical architecture engineering and delivery of our windows product family and is responsible for our relationships with personal computer manufacturers including multinational and regional original equipment manufacturers “oems” client revenue growth is directly impacted by growth of pc purchases from oems that preinstall versions of windows operating systems because the oem channel accounts for over 80 of total client revenue the differences between unit growth rates and revenue growth rates from year to year are affected primarily by changes in the mix of oem windows premium edition operating systems licensed as a percentage of total oem windows operating systems licensed “oem premium mix” additional differences in growth rates result from the impact from lower cost netbook pcs which are sold with a lower cost version of windows changes in geographic mix and changes in the channel mix of products sold by large multinational oems versus those sold by local and regional system builders 

the majority of revenue in fiscal year 2009 came from sales of windows vista which was released in fiscal year 2007 windows xp operating systems reached endoflife for most editions and sales channels windows xp home edition will continue to be available on netbooks and other windows xp editions will continue to be available in china windows 7 the latest version of windows was released to manufacturing in july 2009 and is expected to be generally available on october 22 2009 

client offerings consist of premium and standard edition windows operating systems premium editions are those that include additional functionality and are sold at a price above our standard editions 

products  windows vista including home basic home premium ultimate business enterprise and starter edition windows xp including professional home media center and tablet pc edition and other standard windows operating systems 

competition 

client faces strong competition from wellestablished companies with differing approaches to the pc market competing commercial software products including variants of unix are supplied by competitors such as apple canonical and red hat apple takes an integrated approach to the pc experience and has made inroads in share particularly in the us and in the consumer segment the linux operating system which is also derived from unix and is available without payment under a general public license has gained some acceptance especially in emerging markets as competitive pressures lead oems to reduce costs and new lowerprice pc formfactors gain adoption partners such as hewlettpackard and intel have been actively working with alternative linuxbased operating systems 

the windows operating system also faces competition from alternative platforms and new devices that may reduce consumer demand for traditional pcs competitors such as apple google mozilla and opera software company offer software that competes with the internet explorer web browsing capabilities of windows products user and usage volumes on mobile devices are increasing around the world relative to the pc oems have been working to make the google android mobile operating system more compatible with small formfactor pcs or netbooks 

our operating system products compete effectively by delivering innovative software giving customers choice and flexibility a familiar easytouse interface compatibility with a broad range of hardware and software applications and the largest support network for any operating system 

server and tools 

server and tools develops and markets software server products software developer tools services and solutions windows serverbased products are integrated server infrastructure and middleware software designed to support software applications built on the windows server operating system windows serverbased products include the server platform including targeted segment solutions database storage management and operations serviceoriented

competition 

our server operating system products face intense competition from a wide variety of server operating systems and server applications offered by companies with a variety of market approaches vertically integrated computer manufacturers such as hewlettpackard ibm and sun microsystems offer their own versions of the unix operating system preinstalled on server hardware nearly all computer manufacturers offer server hardware for the linux operating system and many contribute to linux operating system development the competitive position of linux has also benefited from the large number of compatible applications now produced by many leading commercial and noncommercial software developers a number of companies supply versions of linux including novell and red hat 

we have entered into business and technical collaboration agreements with novell and other linux providers to build market and support a series of solutions to enhance the interoperability of our products with their virtualization management and network security solutions and to provide each other’s customers with patent coverage for their respective products 

we compete to provide enterprisewide computing solutions with several companies that offer solutions and middleware technology platforms ibm oracle and sun microsystems lead a group of companies focused on the java 2 platform enterprise edition j2ee commercial software developers that provide competing server applications for pcbased distributed clientserver environments include ca inc ibm and oracle our web application platform software competes with open source software such as apache linux mysql and php and we compete against java middleware such as geronimo jboss and spring framework 

numerous commercial software vendors offer competing software applications for connectivity both internet and intranet security hosting and ebusiness servers system center competes with server management and server virtualization platform providers such as bmc ca inc hewlettpackard ibm and vmware in the management of information technology infrastructures forefront security products compete with mcafee symantec and trend micro in protecting both client and server applications our products for software developers compete against offerings from adobe borland ibm oracle sun microsystems other companies and opensource projects open source projects include eclipse sponsored by ca ibm oracle and sap php and ruby on rails among others we believe that our server products provide customers with advantages in innovation performance total costs of ownership and productivity by delivering superior applications development tools and compatibility with a broad base of hardware and software applications security and manageability

competition 

osb competes with aol google yahoo and a wide array of web sites and portals that provide content and online offerings of all types to end users we compete with these organizations to provide advertising opportunities for merchants the internet advertising industry has grown significantly over the past several years and we anticipate that this trend will continue longterm competitors are aggressively developing internet offerings that seek to provide more effective ways of connecting advertisers with audiences through enhanced functionality in information services such as internet search improvements in communication services and improved advertising infrastructure and support services we believe our search engine bing helps users make faster more informed decisions by providing more relevant search results expanded search services and a broader selection of content we have also enhanced the user interface to bring a richer search experience which we believe will differentiate us from our competitors to support the growth of our advertising business we also are investing in improving the scale of our advertising platform seamless integration of content and offerings to the mobile platform rich and relevant content for wider consumer reach enhanced communication services technology and operations along with sustained sales efforts we will continue to introduce new products and services that are aimed at attracting additional users through improvements in the user online experience we believe that we can compete effectively across the breadth of our internet services by providing users with software innovation in the form of information and communication services that help them find and use the information and experiences they want online and by providing merchants with effective advertising results through improved systems and sales support

as we continue to respond to market demand for additional functionality and products we will compete with additional vendors most notably in content management and enterprise search collaboration tools unified communications and business intelligence these competitors include autonomy cisco endeca google ibm oracle and sap we believe our products compete effectively with all of these vendors based on our strategy of providing flexible easy to use solutions that work well with technologies our customers already have 

entertainment and devices division 

the entertainment and devices division “edd” is responsible for developing producing and marketing the xbox video game system including consoles and accessories thirdparty games games published under the microsoft brand and xbox live operations as well as research sales and support of those products in addition to xbox edd offers the zune digital music and entertainment device and accessories pc software games online games mediaroom our internet protocol television software the microsoft surface computing platform and mobile and embedded device platforms edd also leads the development efforts of our line of consumer software and hardware products including application software for macintosh computers and microsoft pc hardware products and is responsible for all retail sales and marketing for microsoft office and the windows operating systems 

products  xbox 360 console and games xbox live zune mediaroom numerous consumer software and hardware products such as mice and keyboards windows mobile software and services platform windows embedded device operating system windows automotive and the microsoft surface computing platform 

competition 

entertainment and devices businesses are highly competitive characterized by rapid product life cycles frequent introductions of new products and titles and the development of new technologies the markets for our products are characterized by significant price competition we anticipate continued pricing pressure from our competitors from time to time we have responded to this pressure by reducing prices on certain products our competitors vary in size from very small companies with limited resources to very large diversified corporations with substantial financial and marketing resources we compete primarily on the basis of product innovation quality and variety timing of product releases and effectiveness of distribution and marketing 

our xbox hardware business competes with console platforms from nintendo and sony both of which have a large established base of customers the lifecycle for video game consoles averages five to 10 years we released xbox 360 our second generation console in november 2005 nintendo and sony released new versions of their game consoles in late 2006 we believe the success of video game consoles is determined by the availability of games for the console providing exclusive game content that gamers seek the computational power and reliability of the console and the ability to create new experiences via online services downloadable content and peripherals we

think the xbox 360 is positioned well against competitive console products based on significant innovation in hardware architecture new developer tools online gaming services and continued strong exclusive content from our own game franchises 

in addition to competing against software published for nonxbox platforms our games business also competes with numerous companies that we have licensed to develop and publish software for the xbox consoles zune competes with apple and other manufacturers of digital music and entertainment devices our pc hardware products face aggressive competition from computer and other hardware manufacturers many of which are also current or potential partners mediaroom faces competition primarily from a variety of competitors that provide elements of an internet protocol television delivery platform but that do not provide endtoend solutions for the network operator windows mobile software and services faces substantial competition from apple google nokia openwave systems palm qualcomm research in motion and symbian the embedded operating system business is highly fragmented with many competitive offerings key competitors include ibm intel and versions of embeddable linux from commercial linux vendors such as metrowerks and montavista software 

operations 

to serve the needs of customers around the world and to improve the quality and usability of products in international markets we localize many of our products to reflect local languages and conventions localizing a product may require modifying the user interface altering dialog boxes and translating text 

our operational centers support all operations in their regions including customer contract and order processing credit and collections information processing and vendor management and logistics the regional center in ireland supports the european middle eastern and african region the center in singapore supports the japan greater china and asiapacific region and the centers in fargo north dakota fort lauderdale florida puerto rico redmond washington and reno nevada support latin america and north america in addition to the operational centers we also operate data centers throughout the united states and in europe 

we contract most of our manufacturing activities for xbox 360 and related games zune various retail software packaged products and microsoft hardware to third parties our products may include some components that are available from only one or limited sources our xbox 360 console includes certain key components that are supplied by a single source the central processing unit is purchased from ibm and the graphics chips and embedded dynamic random access memory chips for the graphics processing unit are purchased from taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company although we have chosen to initially source these key xbox 360 components from a single supplier we are under no obligation to exclusively source components from these vendors in the future beyond the exceptions noted we generally have the ability to use other custom manufacturers if the current vendor becomes unavailable we generally have multiple sources for raw materials supplies and components and are often able to acquire component parts and materials on a volume discount basis 

research and development 

during fiscal years 2009 2008 and 2007 research and development expense was 90 billion 82 billion and 71 billion respectively these amounts represented 15 14 and 14 respectively of revenue in each of those years we plan to continue to make significant investments in a broad range of research and product development efforts 

while most of our software products are developed internally we also purchase technology license intellectual property rights and oversee thirdparty development and localization of certain products we believe we are not materially dependent upon licenses and other agreements with third parties relating to the development of our products internal development allows us to maintain closer technical control over our products it also gives us the freedom to decide which modifications and enhancements are most important and when they should be implemented generally we also create product documentation internally we strive to obtain information as early as possible about changing usage patterns and hardware advances that may affect software design before releasing new software platforms we provide application vendors with a range of resources and guidelines for development training and testing

investing in business and product development 

innovation is the foundation for microsoft’s success our model for growth is based on our ability to initiate and embrace disruptive technology trends to enter new markets both in terms of geographies and product areas and to drive broad adoption of the products and services we develop and market we maintain our longterm commitment to research and development across a wide spectrum of technologies tools and platforms spanning communication and collaboration information access and organization entertainment business and ecommerce advertising and devices 

increasingly we are taking a global approach to innovation while our main research and development facilities are located in the united states in redmond washington we also operate research facilities in other parts of the united states and around the world including canada china denmark england india ireland and israel this global approach will help us remain competitive in local markets and enables us to continue to attract top talent from across the world 

we invest in innovation by focusing on the emerging technology trends and breakthroughs that we believe offer the greatest opportunity to deliver value to our customers and growth for the company microsoft research is one of the world’s largest computer science research organizations and works in close collaboration with top universities around the world to advance the stateoftheart in computer science providing us a unique perspective on future technology trends 

based on our assessment of key technology trends and our broad focus on longterm research and development of new products and services areas where we see significant opportunities to drive future growth include 

cloud computing and software plus services 

the ability to combine the power of desktop and server software with the reach of the internet is creating important opportunities for growth in almost every one of our businesses accordingly we are focused on innovation and broadening our platform to develop a cloud computing ecosystem that positions us for success in areas including virtualization management and security identity we are also focused on delivering endtoend experiences that connect users to information communications entertainment and people in new ways across their lives at home at work and the broadest possible range of mobile scenarios through investments in datacenters new versions of windows and office that are designed to support a wide range of connected scenarios solutions for businesses that can be deployed by a customer by a service provider like microsoft or by a microsoft partner tools for developers and web designers and consumer products including xbox 360 and zune 

natural user interfaces 

the next few years will also see dramatic changes in the way people interact with technology as touch gestures handwriting and speech recognition become a normal part of how we control devices this will make technology more accessible and simpler to use and will create opportunities to reach new markets and deliver new kinds of computing experiences our longterm investments in natural user interfaces can be seen in products like windows 7 the microsoft auto software platform and microsoft surface 

new scenario innovation 

continuing improvement in the power of computers and devices and the speed and ubiquity of networks is creating opportunities to deliver innovation that will transform a number of key industries and address significant global issues including healthcare environmental sustainability and education in healthcare for example computing will connect personal health information to medical research and help make healthcare more preventive personalized and costeffective today microsoft products such as healthvault and amalga help individuals manage their personal health and enable healthcare professionals to integrate research and health information so they can deliver more effective care we also believe that we are entering a period where personal computers will play an increasingly important role in virtually every field of scientific research and discovery

intelligent computing 

as computing power increases our ability to build software that has the intelligence to understand a user’s preferences based on the tools and information they have accessed in the past and anticipate their future needs is rapidly improving this development will enable us to deliver a new generation of software solutions that make people more productive by enabling them to focus more on what they want to accomplish and less on the steps needed to use technology 

distribution sales and marketing 

we distribute our products primarily through the following channels oem distributors and resellers and online 

oem 

we license our software to oems for distribution as preinstalled software on new pcs the most significant part of the oem business for us is licensing of the windows operating system we also license certain server operating systems desktop applications such as our office productivity suite and consumer software products and we market hardware devices and software as services including our windows live essentials suite to oems we have oem agreements covering one or more of our products with virtually all of the major pc oems including acer asustek dell fujitsu hewlettpackard lenovo nec samsung sony and toshiba a substantial amount of oem business is also conducted with system builders which are lowvolume customized pc vendors operating in local markets 

distributors and resellers 

we license software to organizations under arrangements that allow the enduser customer to acquire multiple licenses of products organizations license our products primarily through large account resellers “lars” and valueadded resellers “vars” many organizations that license products through enterprise agreements transact directly with us with sales support from our enterprise software advisor channel partners these enterprise software advisors typically are also authorized as lars and operate as resellers for our other licensing programs although each type of reselling partner reaches organizations of all sizes lars are primarily engaged with large organizations and vars typically reach the small and mediumsized organizations some of our distributors include ingram micro and tech data and some of our largest resellers include cdw dell software house international and insight enterprises our microsoft dynamics software offerings are licensed to enterprises through a global network of channel partners providing vertical solutions and specialized services we distribute our finished goods products primarily through independent nonexclusive distributors authorized replicators resellers and retail outlets individual consumers obtain our products primarily through retail outlets including best buy target and walmart we have a network of field sales representatives and field support personnel that solicits orders from distributors and resellers and provides product training and sales support 

our arrangements for organizations to acquire multiple licenses of products are designed to provide them with a means of doing so without having to acquire separate packaged product through retail channels in delivering organizational licensing arrangements to the market we use different programs designed to provide flexibility for organizations of various sizes while these programs may differ in various parts of the world generally they include 

open licensing 

designed primarily for smalltomedium organizations 5 to over 250 licenses these programs allow customers to acquire perpetual or subscription licenses and at the customer’s election rights to future versions of software products over a specified time period two or three years depending on the open program used the offering that conveys rights to future versions of certain software products over the contract period is called software assurance software assurance also provides support tools and training to help customers deploy and use software efficiently under the open program customers can acquire licenses only or licenses with software assurance they can also renew software assurance upon the expiration of existing volume licensing agreements

select licensing 

designed primarily for mediumtolarge organizations greater than 250 licenses this program allows customers to acquire perpetual licenses and at the customer’s election software assurance over a specified time period generally three years or less to align to the end of the agreement term similar to the open program the select program allows customers to acquire licenses only acquire licenses with software assurance or renew software assurance upon the expiration of existing volume licensing agreements 

enterprise agreement licensing 

enterprise agreements are targeted at medium and large organizations greater than 250 licenses that want to acquire licenses to software products along with software assurance for all or substantial parts of their enterprise enterprises can elect to either acquire perpetual licenses or under the enterprise subscription program can acquire nonperpetual subscription agreements for a specified time period generally three years 

online 

we have an expanding portfolio of products services and solutions that we distribute online we provide online content and services through bing windows live office live our msn portals and channels and the microsoft online services platform which includes offerings for businesses such as cloudhosted exchange sharepoint and office communications osb provides various premium services to consumers and businesses such as email and messaging communication services and tools such as online search advertising and premium content edd offers the xbox live service which allows customers to participate in the gaming experience online with other subscribers we also offer the microsoft small business center portal which provides tools for smallbusiness owners to build market and manage their businesses online other services delivered online include microsoft developer networks subscription content and updates periodic product updates and online technical and practice readiness resources to support our partners in developing and selling our products and solutions

 item 1a risk factors 

our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties including those described below that could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations cash flows and the trading price of our common stock 

challenges to our business model may reduce our revenues and operating margins our business model has been based upon customers paying a fee to license software that we develop and distribute under this licensebased software model software developers bear the costs of converting original ideas into software products through investments in research and development offsetting these costs with the revenue received from the distribution of their products certain “open source” software business models challenge our licensebased software model open source commonly refers to software whose source code is subject to a license allowing it to be modified combined with other software and redistributed subject to restrictions set forth in the license a number of commercial firms compete with us using an open source business model by modifying and then distributing open source software to end users at nominal cost and earning revenue on complementary services and products these firms do not bear the full costs of research and development for the software some of these firms may build upon microsoft ideas that we provide to them free or at low royalties in connection with our interoperability initiatives to the extent open source software gains increasing market acceptance our sales revenue and operating margins may decline 

another development is the business model under which companies provide content and software in the form of applications data and related services over the internet in exchange for revenues primarily from advertising or subscriptions an example of an advertisingfunded business model is internet search where providing a robust

alternative is particularly important and challenging due to the scale effects enjoyed by a single market dominant competitor advances in computing and communications technologies have made this model viable and enabled the rapid growth of some of our competitors we are devoting significant resources toward developing our own competing software plus services strategies including the windows azure platform our hosted computing platform designed to facilitate the rapid flexible and scalable development of cloudbased services it is uncertain whether these strategies will be successful 

an important element of our business model has been to create platformbased ecosystems on which many participants can build diverse solutions a competing verticallyintegrated model in which a single firm controls both the software and hardware elements of a product has been successful with certain consumer products such as personal computers mobile phones and digital music players we also offer verticallyintegrated hardware and software products however efforts to compete with the vertically integrated model may increase our cost of sales and reduce our operating margins 

we face intense competition we continue to experience intense competition across all markets for our products and services our competitors range in size from fortune 100 companies to small specialized singleproduct businesses and open source communitybased projects although we believe the breadth of our businesses and product portfolio is a competitive advantage our competitors that are focused on narrower product lines may be more effective in devoting technical marketing and financial resources to compete with us in addition barriers to entry in our businesses generally are low and products once developed can be distributed broadly and quickly at relatively low cost open source software vendors are devoting considerable efforts to developing software that mimics the features and functionality of our products in some cases on the basis of technical specifications for microsoft technologies that we make available at little or no cost in response to competition we are developing versions of our products with basic functionality that are sold at lower prices than the standard versions these competitive pressures may result in decreased sales volumes price reductions andor increased operating costs such as for marketing and sales incentives resulting in lower revenue gross margins and operating income 

we may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property rights protecting our global intellectual property rights and combating unlicensed copying and use of software and other intellectual property is difficult while piracy adversely affects us revenue the impact on revenue from outside the us is more significant particularly in countries where laws are less protective of intellectual property rights similarly the absence of harmonized patent laws makes it more difficult to ensure consistent respect for patent rights throughout the world we actively educate consumers about the benefits of licensing genuine products and obtaining indemnification benefits for intellectual property risks and we educate lawmakers about the advantages of a business climate where intellectual property rights are protected however continued educational and enforcement efforts may fail to enhance revenue reductions in the legal protection for software intellectual property rights could adversely affect revenue 

third parties may claim we infringe their intellectual property rights from time to time we receive notices from others claiming we infringe their intellectual property rights the number of these claims may grow to resolve these claims we may enter into royalty and licensing agreements on less favorable terms stop selling or redesign affected products or pay damages to satisfy indemnification commitments with our customers such agreements may cause operating margins to decline we have made and expect to continue making significant expenditures to settle claims related to the use of technology and intellectual property rights as part of our strategy to manage this risk 

we may not be able to protect our source code from copying if there is an unauthorized disclosure of source code source code the detailed program commands for our operating systems and other software programs is critical to our business although we license portions of our application and operating system source code to a number of licensees we take significant measures to protect the secrecy of large portions of our source code if an unauthorized disclosure of a significant portion of our source code occurs we could potentially lose future trade secret protection for that source code this could make it easier for third parties to compete with our products by copying functionality which could adversely affect our revenue and operating margins unauthorized disclosure of source code also could increase the security risks described in the next paragraph 

security vulnerabilities in our products could lead to reduced revenues or to liability claims maintaining the security of computers and computer networks is a critical issue for us and our customers hackers develop and deploy viruses worms and other malicious software programs that attack our products although this is an industrywide problem that affects computers across all platforms it affects our products in particular because hackers tend 

  

  

 part i 

item 1a 

  

  

to focus their efforts on the most popular operating systems and programs and we expect them to continue to do so we devote significant resources to address security vulnerabilities through 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 the cost of these steps could reduce our operating margins despite these efforts actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products could lead some customers to seek to return products to reduce or delay future purchases or to use competing products customers may also increase their expenditures on protecting their existing computer systems from attack which could delay adoption of new technologies any of these actions by customers could adversely affect our revenue in addition actual or perceived vulnerabilities may lead to claims against us although our license agreements typically contain provisions that eliminate or limit our exposure to such liability there is no assurance these provisions will withstand all legal challenges 

we are subject to government litigation and regulatory activity that affects how we design and market our products as a leading global software maker we receive close scrutiny from government agencies under us and foreign competition laws some jurisdictions also provide private rights of action for competitors or consumers to assert claims of anticompetitive conduct for example we have been involved in the following actions 

lawsuits brought by the us department of justice 18 states and the district of columbia in two separate actions were resolved through a consent decree that took effect in 2001 and a final judgment entered in 2002 these proceedings imposed various constraints on our windows operating system businesses these constraints include limits on certain contracting practices mandated disclosure of certain software program interfaces and protocols and rights for computer manufacturers to limit the visibility of certain windows features in new pcs we believe we are in full compliance with these rules however if we fail to comply with them additional restrictions could be imposed on us that would adversely affect our business 

the european commission closely scrutinizes the design of highvolume microsoft products and the terms on which we make certain technologies used in these products such as file formats programming interfaces and protocols available to other companies in 2004 the commission ordered us to create new versions of windows that do not include certain multimedia technologies and to provide our competitors with specifications for how to implement certain proprietary windows communications protocols in their own products the commission’s impact on product design may limit our ability to innovate in windows or other products in the future diminish the developer appeal of the windows platform and increase our product development costs the availability of licenses related to protocols and file formats may enable competitors to develop software products that better mimic the functionality of our own products which could result in decreased sales of our products 

government regulatory actions and court decisions such as these may hinder our ability to provide the benefits of our software to consumers and businesses thereby reducing the attractiveness of our products and the revenues that come from them new actions could be initiated at any time either by these or other governments or private claimants including with respect to new versions of windows or other microsoft products the outcome of such actions or steps taken to avoid them could adversely affect us in a variety of ways including

our software and services online offerings are subject to government regulation of the internet domestically and internationally in many areas including user privacy telecommunications data protection and online content the application of these laws and regulations to our business is often unclear and sometimes may conflict compliance with these regulations may involve significant costs or require changes in business practices that result in reduced revenue noncompliance could result in penalties being imposed on us or orders that we stop doing the alleged noncompliant activity 

our business depends on our ability to attract and retain talented employees our business is based on successfully attracting and retaining talented employees the market for highly skilled workers and leaders in our industry is extremely competitive we are limited in our ability to recruit internationally by restrictive domestic immigration laws if we are less successful in our recruiting efforts or if we are unable to retain key employees our ability to develop and deliver successful products and services may be adversely affected effective succession planning is also important to our longterm success failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution 

delays in product development schedules may adversely affect our revenues the development of software products is a complex and timeconsuming process new products and enhancements to existing products can require long development and testing periods our increasing focus on software plus services also presents new and complex development issues significant delays in new product or service releases or significant problems in creating new products or services could adversely affect our revenue 

we make significant investments in new products and services that may not be profitable our growth depends on our ability to innovate by offering new and adding value to our existing software and service offerings we will continue to make significant investments in research development and marketing for new products services and technologies including the windows pc operating system the microsoft office system xbox 360 live search windows server zune windows live the windows azure services platform and other software plus services offerings investments in new technology are speculative commercial success depends on many factors including innovativeness developer support and effective distribution and marketing if customers do not perceive our latest offerings as providing significant new functionality or other value they may reduce their purchases of new software products or upgrades unfavorably impacting revenue we may not achieve significant revenue from new product and service investments for a number of years if at all moreover new products and services may not be profitable and even if they are profitable operating margins for new products and businesses may not be as high as the margins we have experienced historically 

adverse economic conditions may harm our business unfavorable changes in economic conditions including inflation recession or other changes in economic conditions may result in lower information technology spending and adversely affect our revenue if demand for pcs servers and other computing devices declines or consumer or business spending for those products declines our revenue will be adversely affected our product distribution system also relies on an extensive partner network the impact of economic conditions on our partners such as the bankruptcy of a major distributor could result in sales channel disruption challenging economic conditions also may impair the ability of our customers to pay for products and services they have purchased as a result reserves for doubtful accounts and writeoffs of accounts receivable may increase we maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings types and maturities these investments are subject to general credit liquidity market and interest rate risks which may be exacerbated by unusual events that have affected global financial markets if global credit and equity markets experience prolonged periods of decline our investment portfolio may be adversely impacted and we could determine that more of our investments have experienced an otherthantemporary decline in fair value requiring impairment charges that could adversely impact our financial results 

we have claims and lawsuits against us that may result in adverse outcomes we are subject to a variety of claims and lawsuits adverse outcomes in some or all of these claims may result in significant monetary damages or injunctive relief that could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business although management currently believes resolving all of these matters individually or in the aggregate will not have a material adverse impact on our financial position results of operations or cash flows the litigation and other claims are subject to inherent uncertainties and management’s view of these matters may change in the future a material adverse impact on our financial position results of operations or cash flows also could occur for the period in which the effect of an unfavorable final outcome becomes probable and reasonably estimable

we may have additional tax liabilities we are subject to income taxes in the united states and many foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes in the ordinary course of our business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain we regularly are under audit by tax authorities although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals the results of an audit or litigation could have a material effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made in addition there have been proposals to reform us tax laws that would significantly impact how us multinational corporations are taxed on foreign earnings we earn a substantial portion of our income in foreign countries although we cannot predict whether or in what form this proposed legislation will pass if enacted it could have a material adverse impact on our tax expense and cash flow 

our verticallyintegrated hardware and software products may experience quality or supply problems  our hardware products such as the xbox 360 console are highly complex and can have defects in design manufacture or associated software we could incur significant expenses lost revenue and reputational harm if we fail to detect or effectively address such issues through design testing or warranty repairs we obtain some components of our hardware devices from sole suppliers if a component delivery from a solesource supplier is delayed or becomes unavailable or industry shortages occur we may be unable to obtain timely replacement supplies resulting in reduced sales either component shortages or excess or obsolete inventory may require us to record charges to cost of revenue xbox 360 consoles are assembled in asia disruptions in the supply chain may result in console shortages that would affect our revenues and operating margins these same risks would apply to any other verticallyintegrated hardware and software products we may offer 

if our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets become impaired we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings under generally accepted accounting principles we review our amortizable intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually factors that may be considered a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets may not be recoverable include a decline in stock price and market capitalization reduced future cash flow estimates and slower growth rates in our industry we may be required to record a significant charge in our financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets is determined negatively impacting our results of operations

financial condition and results of operations 

results of operations for fiscal years 2009 2008 and 2007 

overview 

the following management’s discussion and analysis “mda” is intended to help the reader understand the results of operations and financial condition of microsoft corporation mda is provided as a supplement to and should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the accompanying notes to the financial statements “notes” 

we generate revenue by developing manufacturing licensing and supporting a wide range of software products and services for many different types of computing devices our software products and services include operating systems for personal computers servers and intelligent devices server applications for distributed computing environments information worker productivity applications business solutions applications highperformance computing applications software development tools and video games we provide consulting and product support services and we train and certify computer system integrators and developers we also design and sell hardware including the xbox 360 video game console the zune digital music and entertainment device and peripherals online offerings and information are delivered through bing windows live office live our msn portals and channels and the microsoft online services platform which includes offerings for businesses such as microsoft dynamics crm online exchange hosted services exchange online and sharepoint online we enable the delivery of online advertising across our broad range of digital media properties and on bing through our proprietary adcenter platform 

our revenue historically has fluctuated quarterly and has generally been the highest in the second quarter of our fiscal year due to corporate calendar yearend spending trends in our major markets and holiday season spending by consumers our entertainment and devices division is particularly seasonal as its products are aimed at the consumer market and are in highest demand during the holiday shopping season typically the entertainment and devices division has generated approximately 40 of its annual segment revenues in our second fiscal quarter in fiscal year 2007 our revenue was highest in the third quarter due to the recognition of 17 billion of revenue previously deferred from the express upgrade to windows vista and microsoft office technology guarantee programs and preshipments of windows vista and the 2007 microsoft office system the technology guarantee programs provided customers who purchased current products with free or discounted rights to windows vista and the 2007 microsoft office system when those products became available to consumers 

the unfavorable global economic environment adversely affected our business in fiscal year 2009 as consumers and businesses cut back on spending which reduced pc shipments and it investments but because we offer a wide range of products that enable companies to improve productivity and reduce costs and because we have a strong pipeline of products including new versions of windows and office planned for release in fiscal year 2010 we believe that microsoft is wellpositioned to weather the economic downturn as the global economy improves this will create new opportunities to increase revenue to further help weather the economic downturn in fiscal year 2009 we made important adjustments to our cost structure and streamlined internal business processes 

technological innovation is the foundation of our longterm growth and we intend to maintain our commitment to investment in research and development engineering excellence and delivering highquality products and services to customers and partners recognizing that one of our primary business objectives is to help accelerate worldwide pc adoption and software upgrades we continue to advance the functionality security and value of windows operating systems we remain focused on selling our products in emerging markets and reducing the amount of unlicensed software used in those markets 

we also continue to develop innovative software applications and solutions that we believe will enhance information worker productivity improve communication and collaboration in work groups aid business intelligence and streamline processes for small and midsized businesses to sustain growth in the face of competition from other vendors of proprietary and open source software our goal is to deliver products that provide the best platform for network computing – software that is easiest to deploy and manage and that is most secure – with the lowest total cost of ownership 

in addition we continue to invest in research and development in existing and new lines of business including cloud computing search online solutions business solutions mobile computing communication entertainment

and other areas that we believe may contribute to our longterm growth we also invest in research and development of advanced technologies for future software products we believe that delivering innovative and highvalue solutions through our integrated platform is the key to meeting customer needs and to our future growth 

this longterm focus on investment in research and development has enabled us to lay a foundation for future growth by delivering innovative products creating opportunities for partners and improving customer satisfaction our focus in fiscal year 2010 is to build on this foundation and to continue to execute well in key areas through ongoing innovation on our integrated software platform by responding effectively to customer and partner needs and by focusing internally on product excellence business efficacy and accountability across the company 

summary of results for fiscal years 2009 2008 and 2007 

 

 fiscal year 2009 compared with fiscal year 2008 

revenue declined across most segments primarily driven by weakness in the global pc market and the unfavorable economic environment foreign currency exchange rates accounted for a 486 million or one percentage point increase in revenue primary factors contributing to the decline include the following 

 

  

 the above declines were partially offset by increased server and server application revenue reflecting recognition of deferred revenue from previously signed agreements and continued adoption of the windows server platform and applications through sql server enterprise cal suites and system center products 

operating income decreased primarily reflecting decreased revenue operating expenses were flat with decreased general and administrative and sales and marketing expenses offset by increased headcountrelated expenses cost of revenue and employee severance charges

fiscal year 2008 compared with fiscal year 2007 

revenue growth was driven primarily by increased licensing of the 2007 microsoft office system increased xbox 360 platform sales increased revenue associated with windows server and sql server and increased licensing of windows vista foreign currency exchange rates accounted for a 16 billion or three percentage point increase in revenue during fiscal year 2008 

operating income increased primarily reflecting increased revenue partially offset by increased headcountrelated expenses increased costs for legal settlements and legal contingencies and increased cost of revenue headcountrelated expenses increased 12 reflecting an increase in headcount during fiscal year 2008 we incurred 18 billion of legal charges during fiscal year 2008 primarily related to the european commission fine of 14 billion  € 899 million as compared with 511 million of legal charges during fiscal year 2007 cost of revenue increased 905 million or 8 reflecting increased data center and equipment costs online content expenses and increased costs associated with the growth in our consulting services partially offset by decreased xbox 360 costs the decreased xbox 360 costs reflect the 11 billion charge in fiscal year 2007 related to the expansion of our xbox 360 warranty partially offset by increased xbox 360 product costs reflecting growth in unit console sales 

the diluted earnings per share growth was impacted by the 11 billion xbox 360 charge in fiscal year 2007 and share repurchases during fiscal year 2008 

fiscal year 2010 outlook

other income expense 

the components of other income expense were as follows 

 

 effective july 1 2008 we began presenting gains and losses resulting from foreign currency remeasurements as a component of other income expense prior to july 1 2008 we included gains and losses resulting from foreign currency remeasurements as a component of sales and marketing expense we changed our presentation because this better reflects how we manage these foreign currency exposures as such gains and losses arising from the remeasurement of foreign currency transactions are incidental to our operations for the twelve months ended june 30 2009 509 million of losses were reported as other income expense for the twelve months ended june 30 2008 and 2007 221 million and 86 million of gains respectively were previously recorded as a component of sales and marketing expense and have been recast as other income expense 

investments are considered to be impaired when a decline in fair value is judged to be otherthantemporary we employ a systematic methodology that considers available evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments including market declines subsequent to the period end if the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value among other factors we evaluate general market conditions credit quality of debt instrument issuers the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost and for equity securities our intent and ability to hold or plans to sell the investment for fixed income securities we also evaluate whether we have plans to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery we also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the investee including industry and

sector performance changes in technology and operational and financing cash flow factors once a decline in fair value is determined to be otherthantemporary an impairment charge is recorded to other income expense and a new cost basis in the investment is established 

we lend certain fixedincome and equity securities to increase investment returns the loaned securities continue to be carried as investments on our balance sheet collateral andor security interest is determined based upon the underlying security and the creditworthiness of the borrower cash collateral is recorded as an asset with a corresponding liability 

we use derivative instruments to manage risks related to foreign currencies equity prices interest rates and credit to enhance investment returns and to facilitate portfolio diversification gains and losses from changes in fair values of derivatives that are not designated as hedges are recognized in other income expense these are generally offset by unrealized gains and losses in the underlying securities in the investment portfolio and are recorded as a component of other comprehensive income 

fiscal year 2009 compared with fiscal year 2008 

dividends and interest income decreased primarily reflecting lower interest rates on our fixedincome investments net recognized losses on investments increased primarily due to higher otherthantemporary impairments that were partially offset by gains on sales of certain equity investments held in our strategic investments portfolio otherthantemporary impairments were 862 million during the twelve months ended june 30 2009 as compared with 312 million during the twelve months ended june 30 2008 and increased primarily due to declines in equity values as a result of deterioration in equity markets net losses on derivatives increased primarily due to losses on equity commodity and interest rate derivatives in the current period as compared with gains in the prior period net losses on foreign currency remeasurements increased due to the strengthening of the us dollar particularly in the first half of the current fiscal year 

fiscal year 2008 compared with fiscal year 2007 

dividends and interest income decreased reflecting lower interest rates on our fixedincome investments and a reduction in the average balance of interestbearing investments owned net recognized gains on investments which include otherthantemporary impairments of 312 million during fiscal year 2008 and 25 million during fiscal year 2007 decreased primarily due to declines in equity values as a result of the recent stock market decline net gains on derivatives increased primarily due to higher net gains on equity commodity and interest rate derivatives 

income taxes 

fiscal year 2009 compared with fiscal year 2008 

our effective tax rates in fiscal years 2009 and 2008 were 27 and 26 respectively while the fiscal year 2009 rate reflects a higher mix of foreign earnings taxed at lower rates the rate increased from the prior year because the fiscal year 2008 rate reflects the resolution of tax positions relating to our agreement with the internal revenue service “irs” settling the 20002003 examination partially offset by the european commission fine which was not tax deductible as a result of the settlement and the impact on subsequent years we paid the irs approximately 41 billion during fiscal year 2009 

fiscal year 2008 compared with fiscal year 2007 

our effective tax rates in fiscal year 2008 and 2007 were 26 and 30 respectively the fiscal year 2008 rate was lower due to the items noted above 

financial condition 

cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments totaled 314 billion as of june 30 2009 compared with 237 billion as of june 30 2008 equity and other investments were 49 billion as of june 30 2009 compared with 66 billion as of june 30 2008 our investments consist primarily of fixedincome securities diversified among industries and individual issuers our investments are generally liquid and investment grade the portfolio is invested predominantly in us dollardenominated securities but also includes foreigndenominated securities in order to diversify risk we invest primarily in shortterm securities to facilitate liquidity and for capital preservation as a result of the special dividend paid in the second quarter of fiscal year 2005 and shares repurchased our retained deficit including accumulated other comprehensive income was 228 billion at june 30 2009 our retained deficit is not expected to affect our future ability to operate pay dividends or repay our debt given our continuing profitability and strong cash and financial position

in general and where applicable we use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities to determine fair value this pricing methodology applies to our level 1 investments such as exchangetraded mutual funds domestic and international equities us treasuries and agency securities if quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities are not available to determine fair value then we use quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities or inputs other than the quoted prices that are observable either directly or indirectly this pricing methodology applies to our level 2 investments such as corporate notes and bonds foreign government bonds mortgagebacked securities and certain agency securities level 3 investments are valued using internally developed models with unobservable inputs assets and liabilities measured using unobservable inputs are an immaterial portion of our portfolio 

a majority of our investments are priced by pricing vendors and are generally level 1 or level 2 investments as these vendors either provide a quoted market price in an active market or use observable inputs for their pricing without applying significant adjustments broker pricing is used mainly when a quoted price is not available the investment is not priced by our pricing vendors or when a broker price is more reflective of fair values in the market in which the investment trades our brokerpriced investments are generally labeled as level 2 investments because the broker prices these investments based on similar assets without applying significant adjustments in addition all of our brokerpriced investments have a sufficient level of trading volume to demonstrate that the fair values used are appropriate for these investments our fair value processes include controls that are designed to ensure appropriate fair values are recorded such controls include model validation review of key model inputs analysis of periodoverperiod fluctuations and independent recalculation of prices where appropriate 

while we own certain mortgage and assetbacked fixedincome securities our portfolio as of june 30 2009 does not contain direct exposure to subprime mortgages or structured vehicles that derive their value from subprime collateral the majority of the mortgagebacked securities are collateralized by prime residential mortgages and carry a 100 principal and interest guarantee primarily from federal national mortgage association federal home loan mortgage corporation and government national mortgage association

recently issued accounting standards 

recently adopted accounting pronouncements 

on april 1 2009 we adopted the financial accounting standards board “fasb” staff positions “fsp” fas 1574 fsp fas 1152 and fas 1242 and fsp fas 1071 and apb 281 these fsps are intended to provide additional application guidance and enhance disclosures about fair value measurements and impairments of securities fsp fas 1574 clarifies the objective and method of fair value measurement even when there has been a significant decrease in market activity for the asset being measured fsp fas 1152 and fas 1242 establishes a new model for measuring otherthantemporary impairments for debt securities including establishing criteria for when to recognize a writedown through earnings versus other comprehensive income fsp fas 1071 and apb 281 expands the fair value disclosures required for all financial instruments within the scope of sfas no 107 disclosures about fair value of financial instruments to interim periods adoption of these fsps did not have a significant impact on our accounting for financial instruments but did expand our associated disclosures 

on january 1 2009 we adopted sfas no 161 disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities an amendment of fasb statement no 133 sfas no 161 requires additional disclosures about the company’s objectives in using derivative instruments and hedging activities the method of accounting for such instruments under sfas no 133 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  and its related interpretations and tabular disclosures of the effects of such instruments and related hedged items on our financial position financial performance and cash flows see note 5 – derivatives of the notes to financial statements part ii item 8 

on july 1 2008 we adopted sfas no 157 fair value measurements  for all financial assets and liabilities and nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis at least annually sfas no 157 defines fair value establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements this statement does not require any new fair value measurements but provides guidance on how to measure fair value by providing a fair value hierarchy used to classify the source of the information see note 4 – investments of the notes to financial statements part ii item 8 

sfas no 159 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilitiesincluding an amendment of fasb statement no 115 became effective for us on july 1 2008 sfas no 159 gives us the irrevocable option to elect fair value for the initial and subsequent measurement for certain financial assets and liabilities on a contractbycontract basis with the difference between the carrying value before election of the fair value option and the fair value recorded upon election as an adjustment to beginning retained deficit as of june 30 2009 we had not elected the fair value option for any eligible financial asset or liability 

recent accounting pronouncements not yet adopted 

in june 2009 the fasb issued sfas no 167 amendments to fasb interpretation no 46r  which is effective for us beginning july 1 2010 this statement amends fin 46r consolidation of variable interest entities an interpretation of arb no 51  to require revised evaluations of whether entities represent variable interest entities ongoing assessments of control over such entities and additional disclosures for variable interests we believe the adoption of this pronouncement will not have a material impact on our financial statements 

in february 2008 the fasb issued fsp fas 1572 effective date of fasb statement no 157 which delays the effective date of sfas no 157 for us to july 1 2009 for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities except for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis at least annually we believe the adoption of the delayed items of sfas no 157 will not have a material impact on our financial statements 

in december 2007 the fasb issued sfas no 141r business combinations  which replaces sfas no 141 the statement retains the fundamental requirements in sfas no 141 that the acquisition method of accounting previously referred to as the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations but requires a number of changes including changes in the way assets and liabilities are recognized as a result of business combinations it also requires the capitalization of inprocess research and development at fair value and requires the expensing of acquisitionrelated costs as incurred in april 2009 the fasb issued fsp fas 141r1 which amends sfas no 141r by establishing a model to account for certain preacquisition contingencies under the fsp an

acquirer is required to recognize at fair value an asset acquired or a liability assumed in a business combination that arises from a contingency if the acquisitiondate fair value of that asset or liability can be determined during the measurement period if the acquisitiondate fair value cannot be determined then the acquirer should follow the recognition criteria in sfas no 5 accounting for contingencies and fasb interpretation no 14 reasonable estimation of the amount of a loss – an interpretation of fasb statement no 5 sfas no 141r and fsp fas 141r1 are effective for us beginning july 1 2009 and will apply prospectively to business combinations completed on or after that date the impact of the adoption of sfas no 141r and fsp fas 141r1 will depend on the nature of acquisitions completed after the date of adoption 

in december 2007 the fasb issued sfas no 160 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements – an amendment of arb no 51  which changes the accounting and reporting for minority interests minority interests will be recharacterized as noncontrolling interests and will be reported as a component of equity separate from the parent’s equity and purchases or sales of equity interests that do not result in a change in control will be accounted for as equity transactions in addition net income attributable to the noncontrolling interest will be included in net income and upon a loss of control the interest sold as well as any interest retained will be recorded at fair value with any gain or loss recognized in net income sfas no 160 is effective for us beginning july 1 2009 and will apply prospectively except for the presentation and disclosure requirements which will apply retrospectively we believe the adoption of sfas no 160 will not have a material impact on our financial statements 

application of critical accounting policies 

our financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with us gaap preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses these estimates and assumptions are affected by management’s application of accounting policies critical accounting policies for us include revenue recognition impairment of investment securities impairment of goodwill accounting for research and development costs accounting for contingencies accounting for income taxes accounting for stockbased compensation and accounting for product warranties 

revenue recognition 

we account for the licensing of software in accordance with american institute of certified public accountants statement of position “sop” 972 software revenue recognition  the application of sop 972 requires judgment including whether a software arrangement includes multiple elements and if so whether vendorspecific objective evidence “vsoe” of fair value exists for those elements 

a portion of the revenue related to windows xp is recorded as unearned due to undelivered elements including in some cases free postdelivery telephone support and the right to receive unspecified upgradesenhancements of microsoft internet explorer on a whenandifavailable basis the amount of revenue allocated to undelivered elements is based on the vsoe of fair value for those elements using the residual method or relative fair value method unearned revenue due to undelivered elements is recognized ratably on a straightline basis over the related products’ life cycles revenue related to windows vista is not subject to a similar deferral because there are no significant undelivered elements however windows vista revenue is subject to deferral as a result of the windows 7 upgrade option program which started june 26 2009 the program allows customers who purchase pcs from participating computer makers or retailers with certain versions of windows vista to receive an upgrade to the corresponding version of windows 7 at minimal or no cost in addition purchasers of retail packaged windows vista may also qualify for a free or discounted upgrade to the equivalent windows 7 product with participating retailers in participating markets when the product becomes generally available accordingly estimated revenue related to the undelivered windows 7 product is deferred until the product is delivered 

changes to the elements in a software arrangement the ability to identify vsoe for those elements the fair value of the respective elements and changes to a product’s estimated life cycle could materially impact the amount of earned and unearned revenue judgment is also required to assess whether future releases of certain software represent new products or upgrades and enhancements to existing products 

impairment of investment securities 

sfas no 115 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  staff accounting bulletin no 111 and fsp fas 1152 and fas 1242 recognition and presentation of otherthantemporary impairments  provide guidance 

  

  

 part ii 

item 7 

  

  

on determining when an investment is otherthantemporarily impaired investments are reviewed quarterly for indicators of otherthantemporary impairment this determination requires significant judgment in making this judgment we employ a systematic methodology quarterly that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments if the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value we evaluate among other factors general market conditions credit quality of debt instrument issuers the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost and for equity securities our intent and ability to hold or plans to sell the investment for fixed income securities we also evaluate whether we have plans to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery we also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the investee including industry and sector performance changes in technology and operational and financing cash flow factors once a decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary an impairment charge is recorded to other income expense and a new cost basis in the investment is established if market industry andor investee conditions deteriorate we may incur future impairments 

goodwill 

sfas no 142 goodwill and other intangible assets  requires that goodwill be tested for impairment at the reporting unit level operating segment or one level below an operating segment on an annual basis and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value these events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate legal factors operating performance indicators competition or sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment including the identification of reporting units assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units assignment of goodwill to reporting units and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit the fair value of each reporting unit is estimated using a discounted cash flow methodology this analysis requires significant judgments including estimation of future cash flows which is dependent on internal forecasts estimation of the longterm rate of growth for our business estimation of the useful life over which cash flows will occur and determination of our weighted average cost of capital changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and goodwill impairment for each reporting unit we allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the combination we evaluate our reporting units on an annual basis and if necessary reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach 

during the second quarter of fiscal year 2009 we changed the date of our annual impairment test from july 1 to may 1 the change was made to more closely align the impairment testing date with our longrange planning and forecasting process we believe the change in accounting principle related to changing our annual impairment testing date did not delay accelerate or avoid an impairment charge we have determined that this change in accounting principle is preferable under the circumstances and does not result in adjustments to our financial statements when applied retrospectively during fiscal year 2009 the annual impairment test was performed as of july 1 2008 and was performed again as of may 1 2009 

research and development costs 

we account for research and development costs in accordance with applicable accounting pronouncements including sfas no 2 accounting for research and development costs  and sfas no 86 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold leased or otherwise marketed  sfas no 86 specifies that costs incurred internally in researching and developing a computer software product should be charged to expense until technological feasibility has been established for the product once technological feasibility is established all software costs should be capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers judgment is required in determining when technological feasibility of a product is established we have determined that technological feasibility for our software products is reached after all highrisk development issues have been resolved through coding and testing generally this occurs shortly before the products are released to manufacturing the amortization of these costs is included in cost of revenue over the estimated life of the products

item 7 

  

  

legal and other contingencies 

the outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought against us are subject to significant uncertainty sfas no 5 accounting for contingencies  requires that an estimated loss from a loss contingency such as a legal proceeding or claim should be accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated disclosure of a contingency is required if there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss has been incurred in determining whether a loss should be accrued we evaluate among other factors the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss changes in these factors could materially impact our results of operations financial position or our cash flows 

income taxes

operating segments 

we have five operating segments client server and tools online services business microsoft business division and entertainment and devices division our segments provide management with a comprehensive financial view of our key businesses the segments enable the alignment of strategies and objectives across the development sales marketing and services organizations and they provide a framework for timely and rational allocation of development sales marketing and services resources within businesses the segments also help focus strategic planning efforts on key objectives and initiatives across our businesses 

  

  



part i 

item 1 

  

  

due to our integrated business structure operating costs included in one segment may benefit other segments therefore these segments are not designed to measure operating income or loss that is directly related to the products and services included in each segment intersegment cost commissions are estimated by management and used to compensate or charge each segment for such shared costs and to motivate shared effort segments should not be viewed as discrete or easily separable businesses 

client 

client has overall responsibility for technical architecture engineering and product delivery of our windows product family and is responsible for our relationships with personal computer manufacturers including multinational and regional original equipment manufacturers “oems” the segment includes sales and marketing expenses for the windows operating system and product development efforts for the windows platform client revenue growth is correlated with the growth of purchases of personal computers from oems that preinstall versions of windows operating systems as the oem channel accounts for over 80 of total client revenue 

we released windows vista the most recent version of the windows operating system in fiscal year 2007 this release concluded a major development phase that we believe resulted in a significantly more manageable and powerful pc operating system compared with prior releases windows vista includes advances in security digital media user interfaces and other areas that enhance the user and developer experience 

client offerings consist of premium and standard edition windows operating systems premium editions are those that include additional functionality and are sold at a price above our standard editions 

products windows vista including home home premium ultimate business enterprise and starter edition windows xp professional and home media center edition tablet pc edition and other standard windows operating systems 

competition 

client faces strong competition from wellestablished companies with differing approaches to the pc market competing commercial software products including variants of unix are supplied by competitors such as apple hewlettpackard ibm and sun microsystems the linux operating system which is also derived from unix and is available without payment under a general public license has gained some acceptance as competitive pressures lead pc oems to reduce costs and new lower price pc form factors gain adoption apple takes an integrated approach to the pc experience and has made inroads in share particularly in the us and in the consumer segment 

the windows operating system also faces competition from alternative platforms and new devices that may reduce consumer demand for traditional personal computers competitors such as mozilla offer software that competes with the internet explorer web browsing capabilities of windows products user and usage volumes on mobile devices are increasing around the world relative to the pc 

our operating system products compete effectively by delivering innovative software giving customers choice and flexibility a familiar easytouse interface compatibility with a broad range of hardware and software applications and the largest support network for any operating system 

server and tools 

server and tools develops and markets software server products services and solutions windows serverbased products are integrated server infrastructure and middleware software designed to support software applications and tools built on the windows server operating system windows serverbased products include the server platform including targeted segment solutions database storage management and operations serviceoriented architecture platform and security and identity software the segment also builds standalone and software development lifecycle tools for software architects developers testers and project managers server products can be run onsite in a hosting environment or in a webbased environment 

we offer a broad range of consulting services and provide product support services and industry solutions we also provide training and certification to developers and information technology professionals about our server and tools and client platform products

approximately 45 of server and tools revenue comes from multiyear licensing agreements approximately 25 is purchased through fully packaged product and transactional volume licensing programs and approximately 10 comes from licenses sold to oems the remainder of server and tools revenue comes from consulting and product support services 

major releases from server and tools in fiscal year 2008 included windows server 2008 and visual studio 2008 windows server 2008 provides virtualization technologies security enhancements new internet tools and infrastructure and management utilities while visual studio 2008 provides rapid application development team collaboration tools and advances in building connected applications in fiscal year 2009 we plan to release microsoft sql server 2008 which will deliver advances in database scalability performance security and policybased management

competition 

our server operating system products face intense competition from a wide variety of server operating systems and server applications offered by companies with a variety of market approaches vertically integrated computer manufacturers such as hewlettpackard ibm and sun microsystems offer their own versions of the unix operating system preinstalled on server hardware nearly all computer manufacturers offer server hardware for the linux operating system and many contribute to linux operating system development the competitive position of linux has also benefited from the large number of compatible applications now produced by many leading commercial software developers and noncommercial software developers a number of companies supply versions of linux including novell and red hat server virtualization platform providers such as vmware are another form of competition for the windows server operating system 

we have entered into business and technical collaboration agreements with novell and other linux providers to build market and support a series of solutions to enhance the interoperability of our products with their virtualization management and network security solutions and to provide each other’s customers with patent coverage for their respective products 

we compete to provide enterprisewide computing solutions with several companies that offer solutions and middleware technology platforms ibm and sun microsystems lead a group of companies focused on the java 2 platform enterprise edition j2ee commercial software developers that provide competing server applications for pcbased distributed clientserver environments include ca inc ibm and oracle our web application platform software competes with open source software such as linux apache mysql and php and we compete against java middleware such as jboss geronimo and spring framework 

numerous commercial software vendors offer competing commercial software applications for connectivity both internet and intranet security hosting and ebusiness servers system center competes with hewlettpackard bmc ca inc and ibm in the management of information technology infrastructures while our forefront line of business security products compete with mcafee symantec and trend micro in protecting both client and server applications our products for software developers compete against offerings from adobe bea systems borland ibm oracle sun microsystems and other companies these offerings include open source projects like eclipse sponsored by ibm and oracle we believe that our server products provide customers with advantages in innovation performance total costs of ownership and productivity by delivering superior applications development tools and compatibility with a broad base of hardware and software applications security and manageability

competition 

osb competes with aol google yahoo and a wide array of web sites and portals that provide content and online offerings of all types to end users we compete with these organizations to provide advertising opportunities for merchants osb also competes for narrowband internet access users with aol earthlink and other isps for dialup internet access in the united states the internet advertising industry has grown significantly over the past several years and we anticipate that this trend will continue competitors are aggressively developing internet offerings that seek to provide more effective ways of connecting advertisers with audiences through enhanced functionality in communication services improvements in information services such as internet search and improved advertising infrastructure and support services we have developed our own algorithmic search engine to provide end users with more relevant search results expanded search services and a broader selection of content to support the growth of our advertising business we also are investing in our communication services technology operations and sales efforts we will continue to introduce new products and services including windows live services that are aimed at attracting additional users through improvements in the user online experience as consumers migrate from narrowband to broadband internet access we expect our narrowband internet access subscriber base to continue to decline and this portion of our business to decrease in importance we believe that we can compete effectively across the breadth of our internet services by providing users with software innovation in the form of information and communication services that help them find and use the information and experiences they want online and by providing merchants with effective advertising results through improved systems and sales support 

microsoft business division 

microsoft business division “mbd” offerings consist of the microsoft office system and microsoft dynamics business solutions microsoft office system products are designed to increase personal team and organization productivity through a range of programs services and software solutions growth of revenue from the microsoft office system offerings which generate over 90 of mbd revenue depends on our ability to add value to the core office product set and to continue to expand our product offerings in other information worker areas such as content management enterprise search collaboration unified communications and business intelligence microsoft dynamics products provide business solutions for financial management customer relationship management supply chain management and analytics applications for small and midsize businesses large organizations and divisions of global enterprises 

we evaluate mbd results based upon the nature of the end user in two primary parts—business revenue which includes microsoft office system revenue generated through volume licensing agreements and microsoft dynamics revenue and consumer revenue which includes revenue from retail packaged product sales and oem revenue approximately 80 of mbd revenue is generated from sales to businesses revenue from this category generally depends upon the number of information workers in a licensed enterprise and is therefore relatively independent of the number of pcs sold in a given year approximately 20 of mbd revenue is derived from sales to consumers most of this revenue is generated from new licenses acquired through fully packaged products and licenses sold through oems for new pcs and is generally affected by the level of pc shipments and product launches

as we continue to respond to market demand for additional functionality and products we will compete with additional vendors most notably in enterprise content management and search collaboration tools unified communications and business intelligence these competitors include autonomy cisco endeca google ibm oracle and sap 

our microsoft dynamics products compete with wellknown vendors such as intuit and sage in the market focused on providing solutions for small and midsized businesses the market for large organizations and divisions of global enterprises is intensely competitive with a small number of primary vendors including oracle and sap these vendors are positioning many of their business applications to focus more intensely on small and midsized businesses additionally salesforcecom’s ondemand customer relationship management offerings compete directly with microsoft dynamics crm online and microsoft dynamic crm’s onpremise offerings we believe our products compete effectively with these vendors based on our strategy of providing interoperable adaptable solutions that work well with technologies our customers already have

competition 

entertainment and devices businesses are highly competitive characterized by rapid product life cycles frequent introductions of new products and titles and the development of new technologies the markets for our products are characterized by significant price competition we anticipate continued pricing pressure from our competitors from time to time we have responded to this pressure by reducing prices on certain products our competitors vary in size from very small companies with limited resources to very large diversified corporations with substantial financial and marketing resources we compete primarily on the basis of product innovation quality and variety timing of product releases and effectiveness of distribution and marketing

our xbox hardware business competes with console platforms from nintendo and sony both of which have a large established base of customers the lifecycle for video game consoles averages five to seven years we released xbox 360 our second generation console in november 2005 nintendo and sony released new versions of their game consoles in late 2006 we believe the success of video game consoles is determined by the availability of games for the console providing exclusive game content that gamers seek the computational power and reliability of the console and the ability to create new revenue sources such as advertising and downloadable content we think the xbox 360 is positioned well against competitive console products based on significant innovation in hardware architecture new developer tools expanded revenue sources and continued strong exclusive content from our own game franchises such as halo 

in addition to competing against software published for nonxbox platforms our games business also competes with numerous companies that we have licensed to develop and publish software for the xbox consoles zune competes with the apple ipod and other digital music and entertainment devices our pc hardware products face aggressive competition from computer and other hardware manufacturers many of which are also current or potential partners mediaroom faces competition primarily from a variety of competitors that provide elements of an internet protocol television delivery platform but that do not provide endtoend solutions for the network operator windows mobile software and services faces substantial competition from apple nokia openwave systems palm qualcomm research in motion and symbian the embedded operating system business is highly fragmented with many competitive offerings key competitors include ibm wind river and versions of embeddable linux from commercial linux vendors such as metrowerks and montavista software 

operations 

to serve the needs of customers around the world and to improve the quality and usability of products in international markets we “localize” many of our products to reflect local languages and conventions localizing a product may require modifying the user interface altering dialog boxes and translating text

we contract most of our manufacturing activities for xbox 360 and related games zune various retail software packaged products and microsoft hardware to third parties our products may include some components that are available from only one or limited sources our xbox 360 console includes certain key components that are supplied by a single source the central processing unit is purchased from ibm and the graphics chips and embedded dynamic random access memory chips for the graphics processing unit are purchased from taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company and nec corporation respectively although we have chosen to initially source these key xbox 360 components from a single supplier we are under no obligation to exclusively source components from these vendors in the future beyond the exceptions noted we generally have the ability to use other custom manufacturers if the current vendor becomes unavailable we generally have multiple sources for raw materials supplies and components and are often able to acquire component parts and materials on a volume discount basis

during fiscal years 2008 2007 and 2006 research and development expense was 82 billion 71 billion and 66 billion respectively these amounts represented 14 14 and 15 respectively of revenue in each of those years we plan to continue to make significant investments in a broad range of research and product development efforts 

while most of our software products are developed internally we also purchase technology license intellectual property rights and oversee thirdparty development and localization of certain products we believe we are not materially dependent upon licenses and other agreements with third parties relating to the development of our products internal development allows us to maintain closer technical control over our products it also gives us the freedom to decide which modifications and enhancements are most important and when they should be implemented generally we also create product documentation internally we strive to obtain information as early as

 item 1a risk factors 

our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties including those described below that could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations cash flows and the trading price of our common stock 

challenges to our business model may reduce our revenues and operating margins our business model has been based upon customers paying a fee to license software that we develop and distribute under this licensebased software model software developers bear the costs of converting original ideas into software products through investments in research and development offsetting these costs with the revenue received from the distribution of their products certain “open source” software business models challenge our licensebased software model open source commonly refers to software whose source code is subject to a license allowing it to be modified combined with other software and redistributed subject to restrictions set forth in the license a number of commercial firms compete with us using an open source business model by modifying and then distributing open source software to end users at nominal cost and earning revenue on complementary services and products these firms do not bear the full costs of research and development for the software some of these firms may build upon microsoft ideas that we provide to them free or at low royalties in connection with our interoperability initiatives to the extent open source software gains increasing market acceptance our sales revenue and operating margins may decline 

  

  

 part i 

item 1a 

  

  

another development is the business model under which companies provide content and software in the form of applications data and related services over the internet in exchange for revenues primarily from advertising or subscriptions an example of an advertisingfunded business model is internet search where providing a robust alternative is particularly important and challenging due to the scale effects enjoyed by a single market dominant competitor advances in computing and communications technologies have made this model viable and enabled the rapid growth of some of our competitors we are devoting significant resources toward developing our own competing software plus services strategies it is uncertain whether these strategies will be successful 

an important element of our business model has been to create platformbased ecosystems on which many participants can build diverse solutions a competing verticallyintegrated model in which a single firm controls both the software and hardware elements of a product has been successful with certain consumer products such as personal computers mobile phones and digital music players we also offer verticallyintegrated hardware and software products however efforts to compete with the vertically integrated model may increase our cost of sales and reduce operating margins 

we face intense competition we continue to experience intense competition across all markets for our products and services our competitors range in size from fortune 100 companies to small specialized singleproduct businesses and open source communitybased projects although we believe the breadth of our businesses and product portfolio is a competitive advantage our competitors that are focused on narrower product lines may be more effective in devoting technical marketing and financial resources to compete with us in addition barriers to entry in our businesses generally are low and products once developed can be distributed broadly and quickly at relatively low cost open source software vendors are devoting considerable efforts to developing software that mimics the features and functionality of our products in some cases on the basis of technical specifications for microsoft technologies that we make available in response to competition we are developing versions of our products with basic functionality that are sold at lower prices than the standard versions these competitive pressures may result in decreased sales volumes price reductions andor increased operating costs such as for marketing and sales incentives resulting in lower revenue gross margins and operating income 

we may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property rights protecting our global intellectual property rights and combating unlicensed copying and use of software and other intellectual property is difficult while piracy adversely affects us revenue the impact on revenue from outside the us is more significant particularly in countries where laws are less protective of intellectual property rights similarly the absence of harmonized patent laws makes it more difficult to ensure consistent respect for patent rights throughout the world we actively educate consumers about the benefits of licensing genuine products and obtaining indemnification benefits for intellectual property risks and we educate lawmakers about the advantages of a business climate where intellectual property rights are protected however continued educational and enforcement efforts may fail to enhance revenue reductions in the legal protection for software intellectual property rights could adversely affect revenue 

third parties may claim we infringe their intellectual property rights from time to time we receive notices from others claiming we infringe their intellectual property rights the number of these claims may grow to resolve these claims we may enter into royalty and licensing agreements on less favorable terms stop selling or redesign affected products or pay damages to satisfy indemnification commitments with our customers such agreements may cause operating margins to decline we have made and expect to continue making significant expenditures to settle claims related to the use of technology and intellectual property rights as part of our strategy to manage this risk 

we may not be able to protect our source code from copying if there is an unauthorized disclosure of source code source code the detailed program commands for our operating systems and other software programs is critical to our business although we license portions of our application and operating system source code to a number of licensees we take significant measures to protect the secrecy of large portions of our source code if an unauthorized disclosure of a significant portion of our source code occurs we could potentially lose future trade secret protection for that source code this could make it easier for third parties to compete with our products by copying functionality which could adversely affect our revenue and operating margins unauthorized disclosure of source code also could increase the security risks described in the next paragraph 

  

  



part i 

item 1a 

  

  

security vulnerabilities in our products could lead to reduced revenues or to liability claims maintaining the security of computers and computer networks is a critical issue for us and our customers hackers develop and deploy viruses worms and other malicious software programs that attack our products although this is an industry wide problem that affects computers across all platforms it affects our products in particular because hackers tend to focus their efforts on the most popular operating systems and programs and we expect them to continue to do so we devote significant resources to address security vulnerabilities through 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 the cost of these steps could reduce our operating margins despite these efforts actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products could lead some customers to seek to return products to reduce or delay future purchases or to use competing products customers may also increase their expenditures on protecting their existing computer systems from attack which could delay adoption of new technologies any of these actions by customers could adversely affect our revenue in addition actual or perceived vulnerabilities may lead to claims against us although our license agreements typically contain provisions that eliminate or limit our exposure to such liability there is no assurance these provisions will withstand all legal challenges 

we are subject to government litigation and regulatory activity that affects how we design and market our products as a leading global software maker we receive close scrutiny from government agencies under us and foreign competition laws some jurisdictions also provide private rights of action for competitors or consumers to assert claims of anticompetitive conduct for example we have been involved in the following actions 

lawsuits brought by the us department of justice 18 states and the district of columbia in two separate actions were resolved through a consent decree that took effect in 2001 and a final judgment entered in 2002 these proceedings imposed various constraints on our windows operating system businesses these constraints include limits on certain contracting practices mandated disclosure of certain software program interfaces and protocols and rights for computer manufacturers to limit the visibility of certain windows features in new pcs we believe we are in full compliance with these rules however if we fail to comply with them additional restrictions could be imposed on us that would adversely affect our business 

the european commission closely scrutinizes the design of highvolume microsoft products and the terms on which we make certain technologies used in these products such as file formats programming interfaces and protocols available to other companies in 2004 the commission ordered us to create new versions of windows that do not include certain multimedia technologies and to provide our competitors with specifications for how to implement certain proprietary windows communications protocols in their own products the commission’s impact on product design may limit our ability to innovate in windows or other products in the future diminish the developer appeal of the windows platform and increase our product development costs the availability of licenses related to protocols and file formats may enable competitors to develop software products that better mimic the functionality of our own products which could result in decreased sales of our products 

government regulatory actions and court decisions may hinder our ability to provide the benefits of our software to consumers and businesses thereby reducing the attractiveness of our products and the revenues that come from them new actions could be initiated at any time either by these or other governments or private claimants including with respect to new versions of windows or other microsoft products the outcome of such actions or steps taken to avoid them could adversely affect us in a variety of ways including 

 

   

  

 part i 

item 1a 

  

  

  

 our software and services online offerings are subject to government regulation of the internet domestically and internationally in many areas including user privacy telecommunications data protection and online content the application of these laws and regulations to our business is often unclear and sometimes may conflict compliance with these regulations may involve significant costs or require changes in business practices that result in reduced revenue noncompliance could result in penalties being imposed on us or orders that we stop doing the alleged noncompliant activity 

our business depends on our ability to attract and retain talented employees our business is based on successfully attracting and retaining talented employees the market for highly skilled workers and leaders in our industry is extremely competitive we are limited in our ability to recruit internationally by restrictive domestic immigration laws if we are less successful in our recruiting efforts or if we are unable to retain key employees our ability to develop and deliver successful products and services may be adversely affected effective succession planning is also important to our longterm success failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution 

delays in product development schedules may adversely affect our revenues the development of software products is a complex and timeconsuming process new products and enhancements to existing products can require long development and testing periods our increasing focus on software plus services also presents new and complex development issues significant delays in new product or service releases or significant problems in creating new products or services could adversely affect our revenue 

we make significant investments in new products and services that may not be profitable we have made and will continue to make significant investments in research development and marketing for new products services and technologies including windows vista the 2007 microsoft office system xbox 360 live search windows server zune and windows live investments in new technology are speculative commercial success depends on many factors including innovativeness developer support and effective distribution and marketing we may not achieve significant revenue from new product and service investments for a number of years if at all moreover new products and services may not be profitable and even if they are profitable operating margins for new products and businesses may not be as high as the margins we have experienced historically 

adverse economic conditions may harm our business inflation softness in corporate information technology spending or other changes in economic conditions that affect demand for computer hardware or software could adversely affect our revenue or our investment portfolio if demand for pcs servers and other computing devices declines significantly or consumer or corporate spending for such products declines our revenue will be adversely affected in addition our revenue may be unfavorably impacted if customers reduce their purchases of new software products or upgrades because new offerings such as windows vista and the 2007 microsoft office system are not perceived as providing significant new functionality or other value to prospective purchasers 

we have claims and lawsuits against us that may result in adverse outcomes we are subject to a variety of claims and lawsuits adverse outcomes in some or all of these claims may result in significant monetary damages or injunctive relief that could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business although management currently believes resolving all of these matters individually or in the aggregate will not have a material adverse impact on our financial position results of operations or cash flows the litigation and other claims are subject to inherent uncertainties and management’s view of these matters may change in the future a material adverse impact on our financial position results of operations and cash flows also could occur for the period in which the effect of an unfavorable final outcome becomes probable and reasonably estimable 

we may have additional tax liabilities we are subject to income taxes in the united states and many foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes in the ordinary course of our business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is 

  

  



part i 

item 1a 

  

  

uncertain we regularly are under audit by tax authorities although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals the results of an audit or litigation could have a material effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made 

our verticallyintegrated hardware and software products may experience quality or supply problems  our hardware products such as the xbox 360 console are highly complex and can have defects in design manufacture or associated software we could incur significant expenses lost revenue and reputational harm if we fail to detect or effectively address such issues through design testing or warranty repairs we obtain some components of our hardware devices from sole suppliers if a component delivery from a solesource supplier is delayed or becomes unavailable or industry shortages occur we may be unable to obtain timely replacement supplies resulting in reduced sales either component shortages or excess or obsolete inventory may require us to record charges to cost of revenue xbox 360 consoles are assembled in asia disruptions in the supply chain may result in console shortages that would affect our revenues and operating margins these same risks would apply to any other verticallyintegrated hardware and software products we may offer 

if our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets become impaired we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings under generally accepted accounting principles we review our amortizable intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually factors that may be considered a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets may not be recoverable include a decline in stock price and market capitalization reduced future cash flow estimates and slower growth rates in our industry we may be required to record a significant charge in our financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets is determined negatively impacting our results of operations 

we operate a global business that exposes us to additional risks we operate in over 100 countries and a significant part of our revenue comes from international sales pressure to make our pricing structure uniform might require that we reduce the sales price of our software in the united states and other countries operations outside the united states may be affected by changes in trade protection laws policies and measures and other regulatory requirements affecting trade and investment changes in regulatory requirements for software social political labor or economic conditions in a specific country or region and difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations although we hedge a portion of our international currency exposure significant fluctuations in exchange rates between the us dollar and foreign currencies may adversely affect our net revenues 

catastrophic events or geopolitical conditions may disrupt our business a disruption or failure of our systems or operations in the event of a major earthquake weather event cyberattack terrorist attack or other catastrophic event could cause delays in completing sales providing services or performing other missioncritical functions our corporate headquarters a significant portion of our research and development activities and certain other critical business operations are located in the seattle washington area and we have other business operations in the silicon valley area of california both of which are near major earthquake faults a catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our critical business or information technology systems could harm our ability to conduct normal business operations and our operating results abrupt political change terrorist activity and armed conflict pose a risk of general economic disruption in affected countries which may increase our operating costs these conditions also may add uncertainty to the timing and budget for technology investment decisions by our customers 

acquisitions and joint ventures may have an adverse effect on our business we expect to continue making acquisitions or entering into joint ventures as part of our longterm business strategy these transactions involve significant challenges and risks including that the transaction does not advance our business strategy that we don’t realize a satisfactory return on our investment or that we experience difficulty in the integration of new employees business systems and technology or diversion of management’s attention from our other businesses these events could harm our operating results or financial condition

improper disclosure of personal data could result in liability and harm our reputation we store and process large amounts of personally identifiable information it is possible that our security controls over personal data our training of employees and vendors on data security and other practices we follow may not prevent the improper disclosure of personally identifiable information such disclosure could harm our reputation and subject us to liability under laws that protect personal data resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue our software products also enable our customers to store and process personal data perceptions that our products do not adequately protect the privacy of personal information could inhibit sales of our products 

we may experience outages and disruptions of our online services if we fail to maintain an adequate operations infrastructure our increasing user traffic and complexity of our products and services demand more computing power we have spent and expect to continue to spend substantial amounts to purchase or lease data centers and equipment and to upgrade our technology and network infrastructure to handle increased traffic on our web sites and to introduce new products and services and support existing services such as xbox live windows live and office live this expansion is expensive complex and could result in inefficiencies or operational failures which could diminish the quality of our products services and user experience resulting in damage to our reputation and loss of current and potential users subscribers and advertisers harming our operating results and financial condition 

other risks that may affect our business other factors that may affect our performance may include sales channel disruption such as the bankruptcy of a major distributor and our ability to implement operating cost structures that align with revenue growth

fiscal year 2007 compared with fiscal year 2006

investments are considered to be impaired when a decline in fair value is judged to be otherthantemporary we employ a systematic methodology that considers available evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments if the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value among other factors we evaluate general market conditions the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost and our intent and ability to hold the investment we also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the investee including industry and sector performance changes in technology operational and financing cash flow factors and rating agency actions once a decline in fair value is determined to be otherthantemporary an impairment charge is recorded and a new cost basis in the investment is established 

we lend certain fixedincome and equity securities to increase investment returns the loaned securities continue to be carried as investments on our balance sheet collateral andor security interest is determined based upon the underlying security and the creditworthiness of the borrower cash collateral is recorded as an asset with a corresponding liability 

we use derivative instruments to manage exposures to interest rates equity prices and foreign currency markets and to facilitate portfolio diversification gains and losses arising from derivatives not designated as accounting hedges are in large part economically offset by unrealized losses and gains respectively in the underlying securities which are recorded as a component of other comprehensive income

income taxes 

our effective tax rates for fiscal years 2008 2007 and 2006 were 26 30 and 31 respectively our effective tax rates are less than the statutory tax rate due to foreign earnings taxed at lower rates the decreased rate in fiscal year 2008 resulted from resolution of tax positions related to our settlement with the internal revenue service “irs” for its 20002003 examination this decline was partially offset by the tax effect of the european commission fine of 14 billion  € 899 million which was not tax deductible the fiscal year 2007 rate reflects a recurring effective tax rate of 31 offset by a 195 million reduction resulting from various changes in tax positions taken in prior periods related primarily to favorable developments in an irs position and multiple foreign audit assessments during fiscal year 2006 we recorded a tax benefit of 108 million from the resolution of state audits and recorded a charge of 351 million  € 281 million from the european commission fine which was not tax deductible 

on july 1 2007 we adopted the provisions of the financial accounting standards board “fasb” interpretation no 48 “fin 48” accounting for uncertainty in income taxes – an interpretation of fasb statement no 109  which provides a financial statement recognition threshold and measurement attribute for a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return adopting fin 48 had the following impact on our financial statements increased current assets by 228 million longterm assets by 11 billion longterm liabilities by 21 billion and our retained deficit by 395 million and decreased our income taxes payable by 394 million as of june 30 2008 we had 32 billion of unrecognized tax benefits of which 23 billion if recognized would affect our effective tax rate as of july 1 2007 we had 71 billion of unrecognized tax benefits of which 53 billion if recognized would affect our effective tax rate our policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense interest totaled 121 million in fiscal year 2008 as of june 30 2008 and july 1 2007 we had accrued interest related to uncertain tax positions of 324 million and 863 million respectively net of federal income tax benefits on our balance sheets 

financial condition 

cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments totaled 237 billion and 234 billion as of june 30 2008 and 2007 respectively equity and other investments were 66 billion and 101 billion as of june 30 2008 and 2007 respectively our investments consist primarily of fixedincome securities diversified among industries and individual issuers our investments are generally liquid and investment grade the portfolio is invested predominantly in usdollardenominated securities but also includes foreigndenominated securities in order to diversify financial risk as a result of the special dividend paid in the second quarter of fiscal year 2005 and shares repurchased our retained deficit including accumulated other comprehensive income was 266 billion at june 30 2008 our retained deficit is not expected to impact our future ability to operate or pay dividends given our continuing profitability and strong cash and financial position 

in general and where applicable we use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities to price positions this pricing methodology applies to exchangetraded mutual funds domestic and international equities us treasuries and agency securities if quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities are not available to price positions then we use inputs other than the quoted prices that are observable either directly or indirectly assets and liabilities measured using unobservable inputs are an immaterial portion of our portfolio 

while we own certain mortgage and assetbacked fixedincome securities our portfolio as of june 30 2008 does not contain direct exposure to subprime mortgages or structured vehicles that derive their value from subprime collateral the majority of the mortgagebacked securities are collateralized by prime residential mortgages and carry a 100 principal and interest guarantee primarily from federal national mortgage association federal home loan mortgage corporation and government national mortgage association the remainder of the mortgage position is collateralized by high quality international prime residential mortgage loans

 cash flows 

fiscal year 2008 compared with fiscal year 2007 

cash flow from operations increased 38 billion due to an increase in cash received from customers driven by 18 revenue growth partially offset by the 14 billion  € 899 million payment of the european commission fine cash used for financing decreased 116 billion primarily due to a 150 billion decrease in common stock repurchases partially offset by a 33 billion decrease in cash proceeds from the issuance of common stock cash used for investing was 46 billion for fiscal year 2008 as compared with cash provided of 61 billion for fiscal year 2007 this decrease was primarily due to a 69 billion increase in cash paid for acquisition of companies reflecting the purchase of aquantive in the first quarter of fiscal year 2008 a 918 million increase in purchases of property and equipment and a 31 billion decrease in cash from combined investment purchases sales and maturities 

as a result of our settlement related to the 20002003 examination we paid the irs approximately 31 billion during the first quarter of fiscal year 2009 

fiscal year 2007 compared with fiscal year 2006 

cash flow from operations increased 34 billion due to an increase in cash received from customers driven by 15 revenue growth along with a 16 billion decrease in cash outflow for other current assets primarily reflecting changes in inventory cash used for financing increased 40 billion several events occurred during fiscal year 2007 affecting cash used for financing we issued 68 billion of common stock including 33 billion related to 113 million call options exercised by jpmorgan in december 2006 we also completed our tender offer on august 17 2006 which was included in the 276 billion of common stock repurchases cash from investing decreased 19 billion due to a 35 billion decline in securities lending activity where cash collateral is received from the counterparty along with 12 billion spent on acquisitions of companies and additions to property and equipment these impacts were partially offset by a 28 billion increase in net cash from combined investment purchases sales and maturities

recent accounting pronouncements not yet adopted 

in march 2008 the fasb issued sfas no 161 disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities an amendment of fasb statement no 133 which requires additional disclosures about the objectives of the derivative instruments and hedging activities the method of accounting for such instruments under sfas no 133 and its related interpretations and a tabular disclosure of the effects of such instruments and related hedged items on our financial position financial performance and cash flows sfas no 161 is effective for us beginning january 1 2009 we are currently assessing the potential impact that adoption of sfas no 161 may have on our financial statements 

in december 2007 the fasb issued sfas no 141r business combinations  which replaces sfas no 141 the statement retains the purchase method of accounting for acquisitions but requires a number of changes including changes in the way assets and liabilities are recognized in the purchase accounting it also changes the recognition of assets acquired and liabilities assumed arising from contingencies requires the capitalization of inprocess research and development at fair value and requires the expensing of acquisitionrelated costs as incurred sfas no 141r is effective for us beginning july 1 2009 and will apply prospectively to business combinations completed on or after that date 

in december 2007 the fasb issued sfas no 160 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements an amendment of arb no 51 which changes the accounting and reporting for minority interests minority interests will be recharacterized as noncontrolling interests and will be reported as a component of equity separate from the parent’s equity and purchases or sales of equity interests that do not result in a change in control will be accounted for as equity transactions in addition net income attributable to the noncontrolling interest will be included in consolidated net income on the face of the income statement and upon a loss of control the interest sold as well as any interest retained will be recorded at fair value with any gain or loss recognized in earnings sfas no 160 is effective for us beginning july 1 2009 and will apply prospectively except for the presentation and disclosure requirements which will apply retrospectively we are currently assessing the potential impact that adoption of sfas no 160 may have on our financial statements 

in february 2007 the fasb issued sfas no 159 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities  sfas no 159 gives us the irrevocable option to carry many financial assets and liabilities at fair values with changes in fair value recognized in earnings sfas no 159 is effective for us beginning july 1 2008 we do not believe sfas no 159 will have a material impact on our financial statements 

in september 2006 the fasb issued sfas no 157 fair value measurements  which defines fair value establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements this statement does not require any new fair value measurements but provides guidance on how to measure fair value by providing a fair value hierarchy used to classify the source of the information in february 2008 the fasb issued fasb staff position “fsp” 1572 effective date of fasb statement no 157 which delays the effective date of sfas no 157 for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities except for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis at least annually sfas no 157 is effective for us beginning july 1 2008 fsp 1572 delays the effective date for certain items to july 1 2009 we do not believe sfas no 157 will have a material impact on our financial statements 

application of critical accounting policies 

 

our financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with us gaap preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses these estimates and assumptions are affected by management’s application of accounting policies critical accounting policies for us include revenue recognition impairment of investment securities impairment of goodwill accounting for research and development costs accounting for contingencies accounting for income taxes accounting for stockbased compensation and accounting for product warranties 

we account for the licensing of software in accordance with american institute of certified public accountants statement of position “sop” 972 software revenue recognition  the application of sop 972 requires judgment including whether a software arrangement includes multiple elements and if so whether vendorspecific objective evidence “vsoe” of fair value exists for those elements for some of our products customers receive certain

elements of our products over a period of time these elements include free postdelivery telephone support and the right to receive unspecified upgradesenhancements of microsoft internet explorer on a whenandifavailable basis the fair value of these elements is recognized over the estimated life cycle for the windows xp and previous pc operating systems for windows vista there are no significant undelivered elements and accordingly no license revenue is deferred for windows vista sales changes to the elements in a software arrangement the ability to identify vsoe for those elements the fair value of the respective elements and changes to a product’s estimated life cycle could materially impact the amount of earned and unearned revenue judgment is also required to assess whether future releases of certain software represent new products or upgrades and enhancements to existing products 

sfas no 115 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  and staff accounting bulletin topic 5m accounting for noncurrent marketable equity securities  provide guidance on determining when an investment is otherthantemporarily impaired investments are reviewed quarterly for indicators of otherthantemporary impairment this determination requires significant judgment in making this judgment we employ a systematic methodology quarterly that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments if the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value we evaluate among other factors general market conditions the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost and our intent and ability to hold the investment we also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the investee including industry and sector performance changes in technology operational and financing cash flow factors and rating agency actions once a decline in fair value is determined to be otherthantemporary an impairment charge is recorded and a new cost basis in the investment is established if market industry andor investee conditions deteriorate we may incur future impairments 

sfas no 142 goodwill and other intangible assets  requires that goodwill be tested for impairment at the reporting unit level operating segment or one level below an operating segment on an annual basis july 1 for us and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value these events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate legal factors operating performance indicators competition or sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment including the identification of reporting units assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units assignment of goodwill to reporting units and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit the fair value of each reporting unit is estimated using a discounted cash flow methodology this analysis requires significant judgments including estimation of future cash flows which is dependent on internal forecasts estimation of the longterm rate of growth for our business the useful life over which cash flows will occur and determination of our weighted average cost of capital changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and goodwill impairment for each reporting unit we allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the combination we evaluate our reporting units on an annual basis and if necessary reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach 

we account for research and development costs in accordance with applicable accounting pronouncements including sfas no 2 accounting for research and development costs  and sfas no 86 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold leased or otherwise marketed  sfas no 86 specifies that costs incurred internally in researching and developing a computer software product should be charged to expense until technological feasibility has been established for the product once technological feasibility is established all software costs should be capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers judgment is required in determining when technological feasibility of a product is established we have determined that technological feasibility for our software products is reached after all highrisk development issues have been resolved through coding and testing generally this occurs shortly before the products are released to manufacturing 

the outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought against us are subject to significant uncertainty sfas no 5 accounting for contingencies  requires that an estimated loss from a loss contingency such as a legal proceeding or claim should be accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated disclosure of a contingency is required if there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss has been incurred in determining whether a loss should be accrued we evaluate among other factors the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss changes in these factors could materially impact our results of operations financial position or our cash flows

sfas no 109 accounting for income taxes  establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for the effect of income taxes the objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity’s financial statements or tax returns accruals for uncertain tax positions are provided for in accordance with the requirements of fin 48 under fin 48 we may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement fin 48 also provides guidance on derecognition of income tax assets and liabilities classification of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities accounting for interest and penalties associated with tax positions and income tax disclosures judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

we account for stockbased compensation in accordance with sfas no 123r sharebased payment  under the fair value recognition provisions of this statement sharebased compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period determining the fair value of sharebased awards at the grant date requires judgment including estimating expected dividends in addition judgment is also required in estimating the amount of sharebased awards that are expected to be forfeited if actual results differ significantly from these estimates stockbased compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially impacted 

we account for product warranties in accordance with sfas no 5 accounting for contingencies  we provide for the estimated costs of hardware and software warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized for hardware warranty we estimate the costs based on historical and projected product failure rates historical and projected repair costs and knowledge of specific product failures if any the specific hardware warranty terms and conditions vary depending upon the product sold and country in which we do business but generally include parts and labor over a period generally ranging from 90 days to three years for software warranty we estimate the costs to provide bug fixes such as security patches over the life of the software we regularly reevaluate our estimates to assess the adequacy of the recorded warranty liabilities and adjust the amounts as necessary

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to foreign currency interest rate fixedincome equity and commodity price risks a portion of these risks is hedged but fluctuations could impact our results of operations financial position and cash flows we hedge a portion of anticipated revenue and accounts receivable exposure to foreign currency fluctuations primarily with option contracts we monitor our foreign currency exposures daily to maximize the overall effectiveness of our foreign currency hedge positions principal currencies hedged include the euro japanese yen british pound and canadian dollar fixedincome securities and interest rate derivatives are subject primarily to interest rate risk the portfolio is diversified and structured to minimize credit risk securities held in our equity and other investments portfolio and equity derivatives are subject to price risk and generally are not hedged however we use putcall collars to hedge our price risk on certain equity securities that are held primarily for strategic purposes commodity derivatives held for the purpose of portfolio diversification are subject to commodity price risk 

we use a valueatrisk “var” model to estimate and quantify our market risks var is the expected loss for a given confidence level in fair value of our portfolio due to adverse market movements over a defined time horizon the var model is not intended to represent actual losses in fair value but is used as a risk estimation and management tool the model used for currencies equities and commodities is geometric brownian motion which allows incorporation of optionality with regard to these risk exposures for interest rate risk exposures such as key rate durations and spread durations are used in calculations that reflect the principle that fixedincome security prices revert to maturity value over time 

var is calculated by computing the exposures of each holding’s market value to a range of over 1000 equity fixedincome foreign exchange and commodity risk factors the exposures are then used to compute the parameters of a distribution of potential changes in the total market value of all holdings taking into account the weighted historical volatilities of the different rates and prices and the weighted historical correlations among the different rates and prices the var is then calculated as the total loss that will not be exceeded at the 975 percentile confidence level or alternatively stated the losses could exceed the var in 25 out of 1000 cases several risk factors are not captured in the model including liquidity risk operational risk credit risk and legal risk 

certain securities in our equity portfolio are held for strategic purposes we hedge the value of a portion of these securities through the use of derivative contracts such as putcall collars in these arrangements we hedge a security’s equity price risk below the purchased put strike and forgo most or all of the benefits of the security’s appreciation above the sold call strike we also hold equity securities for general investment return purposes 

the var amounts disclosed below are used as a risk management tool and reflect an estimate of potential reductions in fair value of our portfolio losses in fair value over the specified holding period can exceed the reported var by significant amounts and can also accumulate over a longer time horizon than the specified holding period used in the var analysis var amounts are not necessarily reflective of potential accounting losses including determinations of otherthantemporary losses in fair value in accordance with us gaap 

var numbers are shown separately for interest rate currency rate equity price and commodity price risks these var numbers include the underlying portfolio positions and related hedges we use historical data to estimate var given the reliance on historical data var is most effective in estimating risk exposures in markets in which there are no fundamental changes or shifts in market conditions an inherent limitation in var is that the distribution of past changes in market risk factors may not produce accurate predictions of future market risk 

the following table sets forth the oneday var for substantially all of our positions as of and for the years ended june 30 2008 and 2007 

 

 total oneday var for the combined risk categories was 123 million at june 30 2008 and 95 million at june 30 2007 the total var is 34 less at june 30 2008 and 39 less at june 30 2007 than the sum of the separate risk categories in the above table due to the diversification benefit of the overall portfolio

our server operating system products face intense competition from a wide variety of server operating systems and server applications offered by companies with a variety of market approaches vertically integrated computer manufacturers such as hewlettpackard ibm and sun microsystems offer their own variant of unix preinstalled on server hardware nearly all computer manufacturers offer server hardware for the linux operating system linux’s competitive position has also benefited from the large number of compatible applications now produced by many leading commercial software developers and noncommercial software developers a number of companies supply versions of linux including novell and red hat server virtualization platform providers based on linux such as vmware represent another means by which linux competes with the windows server operating system 

we have entered into business and technical collaboration agreements with novell and other linux providers to build market and support a series of solutions to make our products work better with their solutions and to provide each other’s customers with patent coverage for respective products 

we compete in the business of providing enterprisewide computing solutions with several companies that provide solutions and middleware technology platforms ibm and sun microsystems lead a group of companies focused on the java 2 platform enterprise edition j2ee commercial software developers that provide competing server applications for pcbased distributed clientserver environments include computer associates ibm and oracle

deemphasize this portion of our business the internet advertising industry has grown significantly over the past several years and we anticipate that this trend will continue competitors are aggressively developing internet offerings that seek to provide more effective ways of connecting advertisers with audiences through enhanced functionality in communication services improvements in information services such as internet search and improved advertising infrastructure and support services we have developed our own algorithmic search engine to provide end users with more relevant search results a broader selection of content and expanded search services to support the growth of our advertising business we also are investing in our communication services technology operations and sales efforts we will continue to introduce new products and services including the windows live set of services that are aimed at attracting additional users through improvements in the user online experience we believe that we can compete effectively across the breadth of our internet services by providing users with software innovation in the form of information and communication services that help them find discover and experience what they want online and by providing merchants with effective advertising results through improved systems and sales support 

microsoft business division 

microsoft business division “mbd” offerings consist of the microsoft office system and microsoft dynamics business solutions microsoft office system products are designed to increase personal team and organization productivity through a range of programs services and software solutions growth of revenue from the microsoft office system offerings which generate over 90 of mbd revenue depends on our ability to add value to the core office product set and to continue to expand our product offerings in other information worker areas such as enterprise content management collaboration unified communications and business intelligence microsoft dynamics products provide business solutions for financial management customer relationship management supply chain management and analytics applications for small and midsize businesses large organizations and divisions of global enterprises 

we evaluate our results based upon the nature of the end user in two primary parts—business revenue which includes microsoft office system revenue generated through volume licensing agreements and microsoft dynamics revenue and consumer revenue which includes revenue from retail packaged product sales oem revenue and sales of preinstalled versions of office in japan approximately 75 of mbd revenue is generated from sales to businesses revenue from this category generally depends upon the number of information workers in a licensed enterprise and is therefore relatively independent of the number of pcs sold in a given year approximately 25 of mbd revenue is derived from sales to consumers most of this revenue is generated from new licenses acquired through fully packaged products and licenses sold through oems for new pcs and are generally affected by the level of pc shipments and product launches

our microsoft dynamics products compete with wellknown vendors such as intuit and sage in the market focused on providing solutions for small and midsized businesses the market for large organizations and divisions of global enterprises is intensely competitive with a small number of primary vendors including oracle and sap these vendors are positioning many of their business applications to focus more intensely on small and midsized businesses additionally salesforcecom’s ondemand customer relationship management offerings compete directly with microsoft dynamics crm live and microsoft dynamic crm’s onpremise offerings we believe our products compete effectively with these vendors based on our strategy of providing interoperable adaptable solutions that work well with technologies our customers already have 

as we continue to respond to market demand for additional functionality and products we will compete with additional vendors most notably in enterprise content management collaboration tools unified communications and business intelligence these competitors include sap ibm cisco with their acquisition of webex oracle with the acquisition of hyperion and other business intelligence vendors such as business objects and cognos 

entertainment and devices division 

the entertainment and devices division “edd” is responsible for developing producing and marketing the xbox video game system including consoles and accessories thirdparty games games published under the microsoft brand and xbox live operations as well as research sales and support of those products in addition to xbox we offer the zune digital music and entertainment device pc software games online games mediaroom our internet protocol television “iptv” software and other devices edd also leads the development efforts of our line of consumer software and hardware products including application software for macintosh computers and microsoft pc hardware products and is responsible for all retail sales and marketing for microsoft office and the windows operating systems edd also includes the mobile and embedded devices platform and is responsible for managing our companywide sales and customer relations with device manufacturers and other communicationsector customers including network service providers and media and entertainment companies 

products xbox 360 console and games xbox live zune mediaroom numerous consumer software and hardware products such as mice and keyboards windows mobile software platform windows embedded device operating system and windows automotive 

competition 

entertainment and devices businesses are highly competitive characterized by rapid product life cycles frequent introductions of new products and titles and the development of new technologies the markets for our products are characterized by significant price competition we anticipate continued pricing pressure from our competitors from time to time we have responded to this pressure by reducing prices on certain products our competitors vary in size from very small companies with limited resources to very large diversified corporations with substantial financial and marketing resources we compete primarily on the basis of product innovation quality and variety timing of product releases and effectiveness of distribution and marketing 

our xbox hardware business competes with console platforms from nintendo and sony both of which have a large established base of customers the lifecycle for video game consoles averages five to seven years we released xbox 360 our second generation console in november 2005 nintendo and sony released new versions of their game consoles in late 2006 we believe the success of video game consoles is determined by the availability of games for the console providing exclusive game content that gamers seek the computational power and reliability of the console and the ability to create new revenue sources such as advertising and downloadable content we think the xbox 360 is positioned well against competitive console products based on significant innovation in hardware architecture new developer tools expanded revenue sources and continued strong exclusive content from our own game franchises such as halo 

in addition to competing against software published for nonxbox platforms our games business also competes with numerous companies that we have licensed to develop and publish software for the xbox consoles zune competes with the apple ipod as well as other digital music and entertainment devices our pc hardware products face aggressive competition from computer and other hardware manufacturers many of which are also current or potential partners mediaroom faces competition primarily from a variety of competitors that provide elements of an iptv delivery platform but that do not provide endtoend solutions for the network operator windows mobile software faces substantial competition from nokia openwave systems palm qualcomm research in motion and symbian the embedded operating system business is highly fragmented with many competitive offerings key competitors include ibm wind river and versions of embeddable linux from commercial linux vendors such as metrowerks and montavista software

operations 

to serve the needs of customers around the world and to improve the quality and usability of products in international markets we “localize” many of our products to reflect local languages and conventions localizing a product may require modifying the user interface altering dialog boxes and translating text 

our operational centers support all operations in their regions including customer contract and order processing credit and collections information processing and vendor management and logistics the regional center in ireland supports the european middle eastern and african region the center in singapore supports the japan greater china and asiapacific region and the centers in fargo puerto rico redmond and reno support latin america and north america 

we contract most of our manufacturing activities to third parties who produce the xbox 360 zune various retail software packaged products and microsoft hardware our products may include some components that are available from only one or limited sources our xbox 360 console includes certain key components that are supplied by a single source the central processing unit is purchased from ibm and the graphics chips and embedded dynamic random access memory chips for the graphics processing unit are purchased from taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company and nec corporation respectively although we have chosen to initially source these key xbox 360 components from a single supplier we are under no obligation to exclusively source components from these vendors in the future beyond the exceptions noted we generally have the ability to use other custom manufacturers if the current vendor becomes unavailable we generally have multiple sources for raw materials supplies and components and are often able to acquire component parts and materials on a volume discount basis 

product development 

during fiscal years 2007 2006 and 2005 research and development expense was 712 billion 658 billion and 610 billion respectively these amounts represented 14 15 and 15 respectively of revenue in each of those years we plan to continue to make significant investments in a broad range of research and product development efforts 

while most of our software products are developed internally we also purchase technology license intellectual property rights and oversee thirdparty development and localization of certain products we believe we are not materially dependent upon licenses and other agreements with third parties relating to the development of our products internal development allows us to maintain closer technical control over our products it also gives us the freedom to decide which modifications and enhancements are most important and when they should be implemented generally we also create product documentation internally we strive to obtain information at the earliest possible time about changing usage patterns and hardware advances that may affect software design before releasing new software platforms we provide application vendors with a range of resources and guidelines for development training and testing 

business and product development strategy innovation is a key factor affecting microsoft’s growth our model for growth is based on broad adoption of innovation willingness to enter new markets and embracing and acting on disruptive trends we continue our longterm commitment to research and development including advanced work aimed at innovations in a wide spectrum of technologies tools and platforms communication and collaboration information access and organization entertainment business and ecommerce and devices increasingly we are taking a global approach to innovation while our main research and development facilities are located in redmond washington we also operate research facilities in other parts of the united states and around the world including china canada denmark england india ireland and israel this global approach will help us remain competitive in local markets and attract top talent wherever it resides 

based on our broad focus on innovation and longterm approach to new markets we see the following key opportunities for growth 

consumer technology to build on our strength in the consumer marketplace with windows vista the 2007 microsoft office system xbox 360 microsoft windows live windows mobile and zune we are focused on delivering products that we believe are compelling and cutting edge in terms of design as well as features and functionality to succeed in consumer technologies we also are working to define the next era of consumer electronics in the past consumer electronics was a hardwarecentric business today the innovation in consumer electronics devices lies in the software that powers them this is creating new opportunities for us to deliver endtoend experiences

item 1 

  

software plus services underlying our opportunities in consumer technologies and in all of our businesses is a companywide commitment to fully embrace software plus services the ability to combine the power of desktop and server software with the reach of the internet represents an opportunity across every one of our businesses as we continue to build out our services platform we will bring a broad range of new products and service offerings to market that target the needs of large enterprises small and mediumsized businesses and consumers 

expanding our presence on the desktop and server while we enjoyed success in fiscal year 2007 with the launches of windows vista and the 2007 microsoft office system we see potential for growth by delivering more value per customer with the planned releases in fiscal year 2008 of windows server 2008 sql server 2008 and visual studio 2008 and the possibility to provide additional value in security messaging systems management and collaboration we believe we are wellpositioned to build on our strength with businesses of all sizes we will continue to pursue new opportunities in high performance computing unified communications healthcare and business intelligence emerging markets are also an important opportunity for us in fiscal year 2007 we announced the expansion of our unlimited potential program as the foundation for our efforts to reach the five billion people around the globe who do not have access to pcs and digital technology today

 item 1a risk factors 

our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties including those described below that could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations cash flows and trading price of our common stock 

challenges to our business model may reduce our revenues and operating margins our business model has been based upon customers paying a fee to license software that we developed and distributed under this licensebased software model software developers bear the costs of converting original ideas into software products through investments in research and development offsetting these costs with the revenue received from the distribution of their products in recent years certain “open source” software business models have evolved into a growing challenge to our licensebased software model open source commonly refers to software whose source code is subject to a license allowing it to be modified combined with other software and redistributed subject to restrictions set forth in the license a number of commercial firms compete with us using an open source business model by modifying and then distributing open source software to end users at nominal cost and earning revenue on complementary services and products these firms do not have to bear the full costs of research and development for the software a prominent example of open source software is the linux operating system although we believe our products provide customers with significant advantages in security productivity and total cost of ownership the popularization of the open source software model continues to pose a significant challenge to our business model including continuing efforts by proponents of open source software to convince governments worldwide to mandate the use of open source software in their purchase and deployment of software products to the extent open source software gains increasing market acceptance sales of our products may decline we may have to reduce the prices we charge for our products and revenue and operating margins may consequently decline 

another development is the softwareasaservice business model by which companies provide applications data and related services over the internet providers use primarily advertising or subscriptionbased revenue models recent advances in computing and communications technologies have made this model viable and enabled the rapid growth of some of our competitors we are devoting significant resources toward developing our own competing software plus services strategies it is uncertain whether these strategies will prove successful 

we face intense competition we continue to experience intense competition across all markets for our products and services our competitors range in size from fortune 100 companies to small specialized singleproduct businesses and open source communitybased projects although we believe the breadth of our businesses and product portfolio are a competitive advantage our competitors that are focused on narrower product lines may be more effective in devoting technical marketing and financial resources to compete with us in addition barriers to entry in our businesses generally are low and products once developed can be distributed broadly and quickly at relatively low cost open source software vendors are devoting considerable efforts to developing software that mimics the features and functionality of our products in response to competition we are developing versions of our products with basic functionality that are sold at lower prices than the standard versions these competitive

pressures may result in decreased sales volumes price reductions andor increased operating costs such as for marketing and sales incentives resulting in lower revenue gross margins and operating income 

we may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property rights protecting our global intellectual property rights and combating unlicensed copying and use of software and other intellectual property is difficult while piracy adversely affects us revenue the impact on revenue from outside the us is more significant particularly in countries where laws are less protective of intellectual property rights similarly the absence of harmonized patent laws makes it more difficult to ensure consistent respect for patent rights throughout the world we actively educate consumers about the benefits of licensing genuine products and obtaining indemnification benefits for intellectual property risks and we educate lawmakers about the advantages of a business climate where intellectual property rights are protected however continued educational and enforcement efforts may fail to enhance revenue reductions in the legal protection for software intellectual property rights or additional compliance burdens could both adversely affect revenue 

third parties may claim we infringe their intellectual property rights from time to time we receive notices from others claiming we infringe their intellectual property rights the number of these claims may grow to resolve these claims we may enter into royalty and licensing agreements on less favorable terms stop selling or redesign affected products or pay damages to satisfy indemnification commitments with our customers such agreements may cause operating margins to decline we have made and expect to continue making significant expenditures to settle claims related to the use of technology and intellectual property rights as part of our strategy to manage this risk 

we may not be able to protect our source code from copying if there is an unauthorized disclosure of source code source code the detailed program commands for our operating systems and other software programs is critical to our business although we license portions of our application and operating system source code to a number of licensees we take significant measures to protect the secrecy of large portions of our source code if an unauthorized disclosure of a significant portion of our source code occurs we could potentially lose future trade secret protection for that source code this could make it easier for third parties to compete with our products by copying functionality which could adversely affect our revenue and operating margins unauthorized disclosure of source code could also increase the security risks described in the next paragraph 

security vulnerabilities in our products could lead to reduced revenues or to liability claims maintaining the security of computers and computer networks is a critical issue for us and our customers hackers develop and deploy viruses worms and other malicious software programs that attack our products although this is an industrywide problem that affects computers across all platforms it affects our products in particular because hackers tend to focus their efforts on the most popular operating systems and programs and we expect them to continue to do so we devote significant resources to address security vulnerabilities through 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 the cost of these steps could reduce our operating margins despite these efforts actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products could lead some customers to seek to return products to reduce or delay future purchases or to use competing products customers may also increase their expenditures on protecting their existing computer systems from attack which could delay adoption of new technologies any of these actions by customers could adversely affect our revenue in addition actual or perceived vulnerabilities may lead to claims against us although our license agreements typically contain provisions that eliminate or limit our exposure to such liability there is no assurance these provisions will be held effective under applicable laws and judicial decisions

we are subject to government litigation and regulatory activity that affects how we design and market our products as a leading global software maker we receive close scrutiny from government agencies under us and foreign competition laws some jurisdictions also provide private rights of action for competitors or consumers to assert claims of anticompetitive conduct for example we have been involved in the following actions 

lawsuits brought by the us department of justice 18 states and the district of columbia in two separate actions were resolved through a consent decree that took effect in november 2001 and a final judgment entered in november 2002 these proceedings imposed various constraints on our windows operating system businesses these include limits on certain contracting practices mandated disclosure of certain software program interfaces and protocols and rights for computer manufacturers to limit the visibility of certain windows features in new pcs some of these rules will expire in november 2007 others will stay in force until november 2009 or later although we believe we are in full compliance with these rules if we fail to comply with them additional restrictions could be imposed on us that would adversely affect our business 

in march 2004 the european commission ordered us to create new versions of windows that do not include certain multimedia technologies to provide our competitors with specifications for how to implement certain proprietary windows communications protocols in their own products the design of these special versions of windows and the terms on which we make our protocol technology available are closely regulated by the commission the product design aspect of the commission decision may limit our ability to innovate in windows in the future diminish the developer appeal of the windows platform and increase our product development costs the availability of protocol licenses may enable competitors to develop software products that better mimic the functionality of microsoft’s own products which could result in a reduction in sales of our products pending resolution of microsoft’s appeal there will remain uncertainty about the legal principles that govern product design and intellectual properties for future releases of microsoft products in europe 

in february 2006 the korean fair trade commission “kftc” issued a decision requiring us to offer two versions of windows pc operating systems one with windows media player and instant messaging software removed and another with those functionalities included but also including promotional links to competing software products if upheld on appeal these remedies could adversely affect the utility and competitive position of windows pc operating systems in korea 

government regulatory actions and court decisions may hinder our ability to provide the benefits of our software to consumers and businesses thereby reducing the attractiveness of our products and the revenues that come from them new legal actions could be initiated at any time either by these or other governments or private claimants including with respect to new versions of windows or other microsoft products the outcome of such legal actions could adversely affect us in a variety of ways including 

 

  

  

  

 our software and services online offerings are subject to government regulation of the internet domestically and internationally in many areas including user privacy telecommunications data protection and online content the application of these laws and regulations to our business is often unclear and sometimes may conflict compliance with these regulations may involve significant costs or require changes in business practices that result in reduced revenue noncompliance could result in penalties being imposed on us or orders that we stop doing the alleged noncompliant activity 

our business depends largely on our ability to attract and retain talented employees our business is based on successfully attracting and retaining talented employees the market for highly skilled workers and leaders in our

industry is extremely competitive we are limited in our ability to recruit internationally by restrictive domestic immigration laws if we are less successful in our recruiting efforts or if we are unable to retain key employees our ability to develop and deliver successful products and services may be adversely affected effective succession planning is also important to our longterm success failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution 

delays in product development schedules may adversely affect our revenues the development of software products is a complex and timeconsuming process new products and enhancements to existing products can require long development and testing periods significant delays in new product releases or significant problems in creating new products could adversely affect our revenue 

we make significant investments in new products and services that may not be profitable we have made and will continue to make significant investments in research development and marketing for new products services and technologies including windows vista the 2007 microsoft office system xbox 360 live search windows server zune and windows live investments in new technology are inherently speculative commercial success depends on many factors including innovativeness developer support and effective distribution and marketing we may not achieve significant revenue from new product and service investments for a number of years if at all moreover new products and services may not be profitable and even if they are profitable operating margins for new products and businesses may not be as high as the margins we have experienced historically 

adverse economic conditions may harm our business inflation softness in corporate information technology spending or other changes in general economic conditions that affect demand for computer hardware or software could adversely affect our revenue or our investment portfolio if overall market demand for pcs servers and other computing devices declines significantly or consumer or corporate spending for such products declines our revenue will be adversely affected in addition our revenue would be unfavorably impacted if customers reduce their purchases of new software products or upgrades because new offerings such as windows vista and the 2007 microsoft office system are not perceived as providing significant new functionality or other value to prospective purchasers 

we have claims and lawsuits against us that may result in adverse outcomes we are subject to a variety of claims and lawsuits adverse outcomes in some or all of the claims pending against us may result in significant monetary damages or injunctive relief against us that could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business although management currently believes that resolving all of these matters individually or in the aggregate will not have a material adverse impact on our financial position results of operations or cash flows the litigation and other claims are subject to inherent uncertainties and management’s view of these matters may change in the future there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on our financial position results of operations and cash flows for the period in which the effect of an unfavorable final outcome becomes probable and reasonably estimable 

we may have additional tax liabilities we are subject to income taxes in both the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes in the ordinary course of our business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain we are regularly under audit by tax authorities although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals the results of an audit or litigation could have a material effect on our income tax provision net income or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made 

our consumer hardware products may experience quality or supply problems  our hardware products such as the xbox 360 console are highly complex and can have defects in design manufacture or associated software we could incur significant expenses lost revenue and reputational harm if we fail to detect or effectively address such issues through design testing or warranty repairs 

we obtain some components of our hardware devices from sole suppliers if a component delivery from a solesource supplier is delayed or becomes unavailable or industry shortages occur we may be unable to obtain replacement supplies on a timely basis resulting in reduced sales either component shortages or excess inventory may require us to record charges to cost of revenue xbox 360 consoles are assembled in asia disruptions in the supply chain may result in console shortages that would affect our revenues and operating margins

if our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets become impaired we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings under generally accepted accounting principles we review our amortizable intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually factors that may be considered a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets may not be recoverable include a decline in stock price and market capitalization reduced future cash flow estimates and slower growth rates in our industry we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings in our financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets is determined negatively impacting our results of operations 

we operate a global business that exposes us to additional risks we operate in over 100 countries and a significant part of our revenue comes from international sales pressure to make our pricing structure uniform might require that we reduce the sales price of our software in the united states and other countries operations outside the united states may be affected by changes in trade protection laws policies and measures and other regulatory requirements affecting trade and investment changes in regulatory requirements for software social political labor or economic conditions in a specific country or region and difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations although we hedge a portion of our international currency exposure significant fluctuations in exchange rates between the us dollar and foreign currencies may adversely affect our net revenues 

catastrophic events or geopolitical conditions may disrupt our business a disruption or failure of our systems or operations in the event of a major earthquake weather event cyberattack terrorist attack or other catastrophic event could cause delays in completing sales providing services or performing other missioncritical functions our corporate headquarters a significant portion of our research and development activities and certain other critical business operations are located in the seattle washington area and we have other business operations in the silicon valley area of california both of which are near major earthquake faults a catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our critical business or information technology systems could severely affect our ability to conduct normal business operations and as a result our operating results could be adversely affected abrupt political change terrorist activity and armed conflict pose a risk of general economic disruption in affected countries or operating costs these conditions may lend additional uncertainty to the timing and budget for technology investment decisions by our customers 

acquisitions and joint ventures may have an adverse effect on our business we expect to continue making acquisitions or entering into joint ventures as part of our longterm business strategy these transactions involve significant challenges and risks including that the transaction does not advance our business strategy that we don’t realize a satisfactory return on the investment we make or that we experience difficulty in the integration of new employees business systems and technology or diversion of management’s attention from our other businesses these factors could adversely affect our operating results or financial condition 

improper disclosure of personal data could result in liability and harm our reputation we store and process significant amounts of personally identifiable information it is possible that our security controls over personal data our training of employees and vendors on data security and other practices we follow may not prevent the improper disclosure of personally identifiable information such disclosure could harm our reputation and subject us to liability under laws that protect personal data resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue our software products also enable our customers to store and process personal data perceptions that our products do not adequately protect the privacy of personal information could inhibit sales of our products 

other risks that may affect our business other factors that may affect our performance may include sales channel disruption such as the bankruptcy of a major distributor and our ability to implement operating cost structures that align with revenue growth

overview 

the following management’s discussion and analysis “mda” is intended to help the reader understand the results of operations and financial condition of microsoft corporation mda is provided as a supplement to and should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the accompanying notes to the financial statements “notes” 

we develop manufacture license and support a wide range of software products for many computing devices our software products include operating systems for servers pcs and intelligent devices server applications for distributed computing environments information worker productivity applications business solutions applications and software development tools we provide consulting and product support services and we train and certify system integrators and developers we sell the xbox video game console and games the zune digital music and entertainment device pc games and pc peripherals online communication and information services are delivered through our msn portals channels around the world and through our search products 

our revenue historically has fluctuated quarterly and has generally been the highest in the second quarter of our fiscal year due to corporate calendar yearend spending trends in our major markets and holiday season spending by consumers in fiscal year 2007 our revenue was highest in the third quarter due to the recognition of 167 billion of revenue previously deferred from the express upgrade to windows vista and microsoft office technology guarantee programs and preshipments of windows vista and the 2007 microsoft office system the technology guarantee programs provided customers who purchased current products with free or discounted rights to windows vista and the 2007 microsoft office system when those products became available to consumers our entertainment and devices division is particularly seasonal as its products are aimed at the consumer market and are in highest demand during the holiday shopping season typically the entertainment and devices division has generated over 40 of its yearly segment revenues in our second fiscal quarter with the exception of fiscal year 2007 we believe the seasonality of revenue is likely to continue in the future 

we intend to sustain the longterm growth of our businesses through technological innovation engineering excellence and a commitment to delivering highquality products and services to customers and partners recognizing that one of our primary challenges is to help accelerate worldwide pc adoption and software upgrades we continue to advance the functionality security and value of windows operating systems and to develop operating system versions targeted at emerging markets we also are increasing our focus on selling our products in emerging markets and reducing the amount of unlicensed software used in those markets in addition we continue to develop innovative software applications and solutions that we believe will enhance the productivity of information workers improve communication and collaboration in work groups aid business intelligence and streamline processes for small and midsized businesses to sustain the growth of our server and tools business amid competition from other vendors of both proprietary and open source software our goal is to deliver products that provide the best platform for network computing – software that is easiest to deploy and manage and that is most secure – with the lowest total cost of ownership 

we continue to invest in research and development in existing and new lines of business including business solutions mobile computing communication entertainment and other areas that we believe may contribute to our longterm growth we also invest in research and development of advanced technologies for future software products we believe that delivering innovative and highvalue solutions through our integrated platform is the key to meeting customer needs and to our future growth 

we believe that over the last few years we have laid a foundation for longterm growth by delivering innovative products creating opportunities for partners improving customer satisfaction with key audiences and improving our internal business processes our focus in fiscal year 2008 is building on this foundation and executing well in key areas including continuing to innovate on our integrated software platform responding effectively to customer and partner needs and continuing to focus internally on product excellence business efficacy and accountability across the company

summary of results for fiscal years 2007 2006 and 2005 

 

 fiscal year 2007 compared to fiscal year 2006 

revenue growth was driven primarily by licensing of the 2007 microsoft office system and windows vista increased revenue associated with sql server windows server and visual studio and increased xbox 360 console sales foreign currency exchange rates did not have a significant impact on consolidated revenue during the year 

operating income growth was driven primarily by the increased revenue and decreased costs for legal settlements and legal contingencies partially offset by increased cost of revenue associated with xbox 360 and windows vista increased osb data centers costs and increased sales and marketing expenses in july 2007 we expanded our global xbox 360 warranty coverage to three years from the date of purchase for a general hardware failure indicated by three flashing red lights as a result we recorded a 106 billion charge for anticipated costs under the warranty policy inventory writedowns and product returns the increase in sales and marketing expenses was primarily driven by increased headcountrelated costs and marketing costs related to recent product launches headcountrelated costs increased 15 driven by a 10 increase in headcount over the past twelve months and an increase in salaries and benefits for existing headcount 

fiscal year 2006 compared to fiscal year 2005 

revenue growth was driven primarily by growth in sql server following the launch of sql server 2005 in the second quarter of fiscal year 2006 windows server and other server applications increased xbox revenue resulting from the xbox 360 launch in november 2005 growth in licensing of windows pc operating systems through oems and increased licensing of office and other mbd software foreign currency exchange rates did not have a significant impact on consolidated or operating segment revenue during the fiscal year 

operating income increased primarily reflecting the revenue increase and a decrease in costs for legal settlements and legal contingencies these changes were partially offset by an increase in cost of revenue primarily related to xbox 360 and an increase in sales and marketing expenses primarily as a result of increased investments in partner marketing and product launchrelated spending headcountrelated costs increased 7 driven by an increase in salaries and benefits for existing headcount and a 16 growth in headcount 

fiscal year 2008 outlook 

worldwide macroeconomic factors have a strong correlation to business and consumer demand for our software services games and internet service offerings we expect a broad continuation in the economic conditions and demand in fiscal year 2008 we also expect continued double digit revenue growth given our product launches in the second half of fiscal year 2007 we expect revenue growth to be higher in the first half of fiscal year 2008 than in the second half we estimate worldwide pc shipments will grow between 9 and 11 we do not expect a significant

fiscal year 2007 compared to fiscal year 2006 

osb revenue increased driven primarily by advertising revenue which grew 314 million or 21 to 184 billion this increase was primarily due to growth in advertising for search home page email and messaging services the increase in advertising revenue was partially offset by a 156 million or 31 decrease in access revenue at june 30 2007 we estimate that osb had over 310 million active hotmail accounts and over 280 million messenger accounts 

osb operating loss increased driven primarily by increased cost of revenue which grew 352 million or 45 and increased headcountrelated costs as a result of continued search and advertising platform investments the increase in cost of revenue was primarily driven by increased data center costs online content expenses and royalties headcountrelated costs increased 30 driven by a 12 increase in headcount and an increase in salaries and benefits for existing headcount

investment income and other 

the components of investment income and other were as follows 

 

 for fiscal year 2007 dividends and interest income declined reflecting a decline in the average balance of dividend and interestbearing investments partly offset by higher interest rates received on our fixedincome investments for fiscal year 2006 dividends and interest income increased due to higher interest rates received on our fixedincome investments partially offset by a decline in the average balance of dividend and interestbearing investments as a result of the 3264 billion special dividend paid on december 2 2004 and stock repurchases made throughout fiscal year 2006 

for fiscal year 2007 net gains on investments increased primarily due to lower otherthantemporary impairments and gains on sales of fixedincome investments in the current period as compared to losses in fiscal year 2006 partly offset by fewer gains on the sale of equity investments otherthantemporary impairments in fiscal year 2007 were not material and were 408 million in fiscal year 2006 net gains on investments decreased in fiscal year 2006 primarily due to increased net losses on sales of fixedincome investments higher otherthantemporary impairments and fewer net gains on equity investments in fiscal year 2006 as compared to fiscal year 2005 for fiscal year 2006 otherthantemporary impairments were 408 million as compared to 152 million in fiscal year 2005 the increase in otherthantemporary impairments in fiscal year 2006 was driven by planned sales of certain investments in an unrealized loss position in order to raise funds for the 20 billion tender offer announced on july 20 2006 

investments are considered to be impaired when a decline in fair value is judged to be other than temporary we employ a systematic methodology that considers available evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments if the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value among other factors we evaluate general market conditions the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost and our intent and ability to hold the investment we also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the investee including industry and sector performance changes in technology operational and financing cash flow factors and rating agency actions once a decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary an impairment charge is recorded and a new cost basis in the investment is established 

we lend certain fixedincome and equity securities to increase investment returns the loaned securities continue to be carried as investments on our balance sheet collateral andor security interest is determined based upon the underlying security and the creditworthiness of the borrower cash collateral is recorded as an asset with a corresponding liability we anticipate that the magnitude of securities lent under this program will remain relatively consistent during the fiscal year 

we use derivative instruments to manage exposures to interest rates equity prices and foreign currency markets and to facilitate portfolio diversification derivative losses during fiscal 2007 were primarily driven by net losses in time value on foreign currency contracts used to hedge anticipated foreign currency revenues during fiscal year 2006 we experienced lower net losses on derivatives as compared to fiscal year 2005 primarily due to net gains on nondesignated equity derivatives in fiscal 2006 as compared to net losses in fiscal 2005 and higher net gains on commodity positions in fiscal 2006 driven by increases in the related commodity indices these gains were partially offset by higher net losses in time value on foreign exchange contracts used to hedge anticipated foreign currency revenues and higher net losses on interest rate derivative contracts in fiscal 2006 net derivative losses in fiscal year 2005 were primarily related to losses on equity derivatives interest rate derivatives and foreign currency contracts partly offset by gains related to commodity positions used to provide portfolio diversification gains and losses arising from derivatives not designated as accounting hedges are in large part economically offset by unrealized losses and gains respectively in the underlying securities which are recorded as a component of other comprehensive income commodity derivatives are held for the purpose of portfolio diversification

income taxes 

our effective tax rate for fiscal years 2007 2006 and 2005 was 30 31 and 26 respectively the fiscal year 2007 rate reflects a recurring effective tax rate of 31 offset by a 195 million reduction resulting from various changes in tax positions taken in prior periods related primarily to favorable developments in an irs position and multiple foreign audit assessments during fiscal year 2006 we recorded a tax benefit of 108 million from the resolution of state audits and recorded a charge of € 281 million 351 million from the european commission fine which was not tax deductible the 2005 tax rate was lower from the reversal of previously accrued taxes and from an irs settlement 

financial condition 

cash and equivalents and shortterm investments totaled 2341 billion and 3416 billion as of june 30 2007 and 2006 respectively equity and other investments were 1012 billion and 923 billion as of june 30 2007 and 2006 respectively our investments consist primarily of fixedincome securities diversified among industries and individual issuers our investments are generally liquid and investment grade the portfolio is invested predominantly in usdollardenominated securities but also includes foreigndenominated securities in order to diversify financial risk as a result of the special dividend paid in the second quarter of fiscal year 2005 and shares repurchased our retained deficit including accumulated other comprehensive income was 2946 billion at june 30 2007 our retained deficit is not expected to impact our future ability to operate or pay dividends given our continuing profitability and strong cash and financial position 

unearned revenue 

unearned revenue from volume licensing programs represents customer billings paid either upfront or annually at the beginning of each billing coverage period that are accounted for as subscriptions with revenue recognized ratably over the billing coverage period for certain other licensing arrangements revenue attributable to undelivered elements including free postdelivery telephone support and the right to receive unspecified upgradesenhancements of microsoft internet explorer on a whenandifavailable basis for windows xp and previous pc operating systems is based on the sales price of those elements when sold separately and is recognized ratably on a straightline basis over the life cycle of the related product other unearned revenue includes services microsoft dynamics business solution products xbox live subscriptions advertising and tv platform for which we have been paid upfront and earn the revenue when we provide the service or software or otherwise meet the revenue recognition criteria

cash flows 

fiscal year 2007 compared to fiscal year 2006 

cash flow from operations increased 339 billion due to an increase in cash received from customers driven by 15 revenue growth along with a 164 billion decrease in cash outflow for other current assets primarily reflecting changes in inventory cash used for financing increased 398 billion several events occurred during fiscal year 2007 that affected cash used for financing we issued 678 billion of common stock including 325 billion related to 113 million call options exercised by jpmorgan in december 2006 we also completed our tender offer on august 17 2006 which was included in the 2758 billion of common stock repurchases cash from investing decreased 191 billion due to a 349 billion decline in securities lending activity where cash collateral is received from the counterparty along with 119 billion spent on acquisitions of companies and additions to property and equipment these impacts were partially offset by a 277 billion increase in net cash from combined investment purchases sales and maturities 

fiscal year 2006 compared to fiscal year 2005 

cash flow from operations decreased 220 billion primarily due to increased payments to fund a 987 million increase in xbox 360 inventory and product costs and increased payments to employees resulting from a 16 growth in headcount these factors were partially offset by increased cash receipts from customers driven by our 11 revenue growth and a 174 billion increase in unearned revenue cash used in financing decreased 2052 billion driven by a 3257 billion reduction in cash dividend payments this impact was partially offset by an 1115 billion increase in common stock repurchases net cash from investing decreased 702 billion driven primarily by an 893 billion decrease in cash from combined purchase sales and maturities of investments and a 766 million increase in additions to property and equipment these factors were partially offset by 312 billion of net cash proceeds from our securities lending program 

we have no material longterm debt stockholders’ equity at june 30 2007 was 3110 billion we will continue to invest in sales marketing product support infrastructure and existing and advanced areas of technology additions to property and equipment will continue including new facilities data centers and computer systems for research and development sales and marketing support and administrative staff commitments for constructing new buildings were 821 million on june 30 2007 we have operating leases for most us and international sales and support offices and certain equipment under which we incurred rental expense totaling 326 million 276 million and 299 million in fiscal year 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively we have not engaged in any related party transactions or arrangements with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect liquidity or the availability of requirements for capital resources in may 2007 we announced that we had entered into an agreement to purchase aquantive inc for approximately 6 billion in cash we expect to complete this transaction in august 2007

we believe existing cash and equivalents and shortterm investments together with funds generated from operations should be sufficient to meet operating requirements regular quarterly dividends and planned share repurchases our philosophy regarding the maintenance of a balance sheet with a large component of cash and shortterm investments as well as equity and other investments reflects our views on potential future capital requirements relating to research and development creation and expansion of sales distribution channels investments and acquisitions share dilution management legal risks and challenges to our business model we regularly assess our investment management approach in view of our current and potential future needs 

offbalance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations 

we provide indemnifications of varying scope and amount to certain customers against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products we evaluate estimated losses for such indemnifications under sfas no 5 accounting for contingencies  as interpreted by financial accounting standards board “fasb” interpretation no 45 guarantor’s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others  we consider factors such as the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss to date we have not encountered material costs as a result of such obligations and have not accrued any material liabilities related to such indemnifications in our financial statements

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our outstanding contractual obligations as of june 30 2007 

 

  

     in may 2007 we entered into an agreement and plan of merger with aquantive inc to acquire the company for approximately 6 billion in cash as part of the agreement and plan of merger we are required to pay 500 million if certain events occur that result in the merger not being completed due to the nature of this obligation this amount has not been accrued for or included in the above schedule the acquisition is expected to be completed in august 2007 

recently issued accounting standards 

in june 2006 the fasb issued interpretation no 48 “fin no 48” accounting for uncertainty in income taxes – an interpretation of fasb statement no 109  which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise’s financial statements in accordance with fasb statement no 109 accounting for income taxes  the interpretation provides a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return under fin no 48 the company may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement fin no 48 also provides guidance on derecognition classification interest and penalties accounting in interim periods disclosure and transition fin no 48 is effective for us beginning july 1 2007 based on our current assessment the adoption of fin no 48 is expected to decrease beginning retained earnings by 200 million to 400 million upon adoption 

in june 2006 the fasb ratified the emerging issues task force “eitf” consensus on eitf issue no 062 “accounting for sabbatical leave and other similar benefits pursuant to fasb statement no 43” eitf issue no 062 requires companies to accrue the costs of compensated absences under a sabbatical or similar benefit

item 7 

  

arrangement over the requisite service period eitf issue no 062 is effective for us beginning july 1 2007 the cumulative effect of the application of this consensus on prior period results should be recognized through a cumulativeeffect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the year of adoption elective retrospective application is also permitted we do not expect the application of this consensus to have a material impact on our financial statements 

in fiscal year 2007 we adopted staff accounting bulletin “sab” no 108 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying current year misstatements  sab no 108 requires companies to quantify misstatements using both a balance sheet iron curtain and an income statement rollover approach to evaluate whether either approach results in an error that is material in light of relevant quantitative and qualitative factors and provides for a onetime cumulative effect transition adjustment the adoption of sab no 108 did not have an impact on our financial statements 

in september 2006 the fasb issued sfas no 157 fair value measurements  which defines fair value establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements sfas no 157 does not require any new fair value measurements but provides guidance on how to measure fair value by providing a fair value hierarchy used to classify the source of the information this statement is effective for us beginning july 1 2008 we currently are assessing the potential impact that adoption of sfas no 157 would have on our financial statements 

in february 2007 the fasb issued sfas no 159 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities  sfas no 159 gives us the irrevocable option to carry many financial assets and liabilities at fair values with changes in fair value recognized in earnings sfas no 159 is effective for us beginning july 1 2008 although early adoption is permitted we are currently assessing the potential impact that adoption of sfas no 159 will have on our financial statements 

application of critical accounting policies 

our financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with us gaap preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses these estimates and assumptions are affected by management’s application of accounting policies critical accounting policies for us include revenue recognition impairment of investment securities impairment of goodwill accounting for research and development costs accounting for legal contingencies accounting for income taxes and accounting for stockbased compensation 

we account for the licensing of software in accordance with american institute of certified public accountants statement of position “sop” 972 software revenue recognition  the application of sop 972 requires judgment including whether a software arrangement includes multiple elements and if so whether vendorspecific objective evidence “vsoe” of fair value exists for those elements for some of our products customers receive certain elements of our products over a period of time these elements include free postdelivery telephone support and the right to receive unspecified upgradesenhancements of microsoft internet explorer on a whenandifavailable basis the fair value of these elements is recognized over the estimated life cycle for the windows xp and previous pc operating systems for windows vista there are no significant undelivered elements and accordingly no license revenue is deferred for windows vista sales changes to the elements in a software arrangement the ability to identify vsoe for those elements the fair value of the respective elements and changes to a product’s estimated life cycle could materially impact the amount of earned and unearned revenue judgment is also required to assess whether future releases of certain software represent new products or upgrades and enhancements to existing products 

sfas no 115 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  and sab topic 5m accounting for noncurrent marketable equity securities  provide guidance on determining when an investment is otherthantemporarily impaired investments are reviewed quarterly for indicators of otherthantemporary impairment this determination requires significant judgment in making this judgment we employ a systematic methodology quarterly that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments if the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value we evaluate among other factors general market conditions the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost and our intent and ability to hold the investment we also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the investee including industry and sector performance changes in technology operational and financing cash flow factors and rating agency actions once a decline in fair value is determined to be otherthantemporary an impairment charge is

recorded and a new cost basis in the investment is established if market industry andor investee conditions deteriorate we may incur future impairments

we account for research and development costs in accordance with applicable accounting pronouncements including sfas no 2 accounting for research and development costs  and sfas no 86 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold leased or otherwise marketed  sfas no 86 specifies that costs incurred internally in researching and developing a computer software product should be charged to expense until technological feasibility has been established for the product once technological feasibility is established all software costs should be capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers judgment is required in determining when technological feasibility of a product is established we have determined that technological feasibility for our software products is reached after all highrisk development issues have been resolved through coding and testing this is generally shortly before the products are released to manufacturing we determined that technological feasibility was reached with windows vista and the 2007 microsoft office system during the second quarter of fiscal year 2007 and accordingly we capitalized approximately 120 million of software development costs the amortization of these costs will be included in cost of revenue over the estimated life of the products previously costs incurred prior to technological feasibility were not material and were expensed as incurred 

the outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought against us are subject to significant uncertainty sfas no 5 accounting for contingencies  requires that an estimated loss from a loss contingency such as a legal proceeding or claim should be accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated disclosure of a contingency is required if there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss has been incurred in determining whether a loss should be accrued we evaluate among other factors the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss changes in these factors could materially impact our results of operations financial position or our cash flows 

sfas no 109 accounting for income taxes  establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for the effect of income taxes the objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity’s financial statements or tax returns judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our financial position results of operations or cash flows accruals for tax contingencies are provided for in accordance with the requirements of sfas no 5

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to foreign currency interest rate fixedincome equity and commodity price risks a portion of these risks is hedged but fluctuations could impact our results of operations financial position and cash flows we hedge a portion of anticipated revenue and accounts receivable exposure to foreign currency fluctuations primarily with option contracts we monitor our foreign currency exposures daily to maximize the overall effectiveness of our foreign currency hedge positions principal currencies hedged include the euro japanese yen british pound and canadian dollar fixedincome securities and interest rate derivatives are subject primarily to interest rate risk the portfolio is diversified and structured to minimize credit risk securities held in our equity and other investments portfolio and equity derivatives are subject to price risk and are generally not hedged however we use putcall collars to hedge our price risk on certain equity securities that are held primarily for strategic purposes commodity derivatives held for the purpose of portfolio diversification are subject to commodity price risk 

we use a valueatrisk “var” model to estimate and quantify our market risks var is the expected loss for a given confidence level in fair value of our portfolio due to adverse market movements over a defined time horizon the var model is not intended to represent actual losses in fair value but is used as a risk estimation and management tool the model used for currencies equities and commodities is geometric brownian motion which allows incorporation of optionality with regard to these risk exposures for interest rate risk exposures such as key rate durations and spread durations are used in calculations that reflect the principle that fixedincome security prices revert to maturity value over time 

var is calculated by computing the exposures of each holding’s market value to a range of over 1000 equity fixedincome foreign exchange and commodity risk factors the exposures are then used to compute the parameters of a distribution of potential changes in the total market value of all holdings taking into account the weighted historical volatilities of the different rates and prices and the weighted historical correlations among the different rates and prices the var is then calculated as the total loss that will not be exceeded at the 975 percentile confidence level or alternatively stated the losses could exceed the var in 25 out of 1000 cases several risk factors are not captured in the model including liquidity risk operational risk credit risk and legal risk 

certain securities in our equity portfolio are held for strategic purposes we hedge the value of a portion of these securities through the use of derivative contracts such as putcall collars in these arrangements we hedge a security’s equity price risk below the purchased put strike and forgo most or all of the benefits of the security’s appreciation above the sold call strike we also hold equity securities for general investment return purposes we have incurred material impairment charges related to these securities in previous periods 

the var amounts disclosed below are used as a risk management tool and reflect an estimate of potential reductions in fair value of our portfolio losses in fair value over the specified holding period can exceed the reported var by significant amounts and can also accumulate over a longer time horizon than the specified holding period used in the var analysis var amounts are not necessarily reflective of potential accounting losses including determinations of otherthantemporary losses in fair value in accordance with us gaap 

var numbers are shown separately for interest rate currency rate equity price and commodity price risks these var numbers include the underlying portfolio positions and related hedges we use historical data to estimate var given the reliance on historical data var is most effective in estimating risk exposures in markets in which there are no fundamental changes or shifts in market conditions an inherent limitation in var is that the distribution of past changes in market risk factors may not produce accurate predictions of future market risk 

the following table sets forth the oneday var for substantially all of our positions as of and for the years ended june 30 2007 and 2006 

 

 total oneday var for the combined risk categories was 95 million at june 30 2007 and 158 million at june 30 2006 the total var is 39 less at june 30 2007 and 38 less at june 30 2006 than the sum of the separate risk categories in the above table due to the diversification benefit of the overall portfolio

approximately 40 of information worker revenue has come from multiyear license agreements with large enterprises revenues from these licenses generally depend upon the number of information workers in a licensed enterprise revenue from this category of agreements is therefore relatively independent of the number of pcs sold in a given year consequently general employment levels particularly in north america and europe significantly affect information worker revenue approximately 40 of information worker revenue comes from new licenses acquired through fully packaged product and volume licensing programs to individual consumers and enterprises of all sizes most of this revenue is sensitive to information technology budgets which often depend on general economic conditions the remaining approximately 20 of information worker revenue comes from licenses to oems for new pcs and is affected by the level of pc shipments the next wave of our flagship product the 2007 microsoft office system is currently under development

competition 

the home and entertainment business is highly competitive characterized by rapid product life cycles frequent introductions of new products and titles and the development of new technologies the markets for our products are characterized by significant price competition we anticipate continued pricing pressure from our competitors from time to time we have responded to this pressure by reducing prices on certain products our competitors vary in size from very small companies with limited resources to very large diversified corporations with substantial financial and marketing resources we compete primarily on the basis of product innovation quality and variety timing of product releases and effectiveness of distribution and marketing 

our xbox hardware business competes with console platforms from nintendo and sony both of which have a large established base of customers the lifecycle for video game consoles averages 5 to 7 years we released xbox 360 our next generation console in november 2005 nintendo and sony have also announced new versions of their game consoles which have not been released success in the transition to the next generation of consoles will depend on the availability of games for the console providing exclusive game content that gamers seek the computational power of the console and the ability to create new revenue sources such as advertising and downloadable content we believe the xbox 360 is positioned well against competitive console products based on significant innovation in hardware architecture new developer tools expanded revenue sources and continued strong exclusive content from our own game franchises such as halo 

in addition to competing against software published for nonxbox platforms our games business also competes with numerous companies that we have licensed to develop and publish software for the xbox consoles our pc hardware products face aggressive competition from computer and other hardware manufacturers many of which are also current or potential partners our mstv business faces competition primarily from ad hoc solutions that address subsegments of the tv delivery platform but that do not provide endtoend solutions for the network operator

to serve the needs of customers around the world and to improve the quality and usability of products in international markets we “localize” many of our products to reflect local languages and conventions localizing a product may require modifying the user interface altering dialog boxes and translating text 

our operational centers support all operations in their regions including customer contract and order processing credit and collections information processing and vendor management and logistics the regional center in ireland supports the emea region the center in singapore supports the japan greater china and asiapacific region and the centers in fargo puerto rico reno and redmond support north america and latin america 

we contract most of our manufacturing activities to third parties who produce the xbox various retail software packaged products and microsoft hardware our products may include some components that are available from only one or limited sources our xbox 360 console includes certain key components that are supplied by a single source the central processing unit is purchased from ibm and the graphics chips and embedded dynamic random access memory chips for the graphics processing unit are purchased from taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company and nec corporation respectively although we have chosen to initially source these key xbox 360 components from

a single supplier we are under no obligation to exclusively source components from these vendors in the future beyond the exceptions noted we generally have the ability to use other custom manufacturers if the current vendor becomes unavailable we generally have multiple sources for raw materials supplies and components and are often able to acquire component parts and materials on a volume discount basis 

product development 

during fiscal years 2006 2005 and 2004 research and development expense was 658 billion 610 billion and 774 billion respectively those amounts represented 149 153 and 210 respectively of revenue in each of those years we plan to continue significant investment in a broad range of research and product development 

most of our software products are developed internally we also purchase technology license intellectual property rights and oversee thirdparty development and localization of certain products we believe we are not materially dependent upon licenses and other agreements with third parties relating to the development of our products internal development allows us to maintain closer technical control over our products it also gives us the freedom to decide which modifications and enhancements are most important and when they should be implemented generally we also create product documentation internally we strive to obtain information at the earliest possible time about changing usage patterns and hardware advances that may affect software design before releasing new software platforms we provide application vendors with a range of resources and guidelines for development training and testing 

business and product development strategy innovation is a key factor affecting microsoft’s growth in fiscal year 2006 we received our 5000 th patent we continue our longterm commitment to research and development including advanced work aimed at innovations in a wide spectrum of technologies tools and platforms communication collaboration and expression information access and organization entertainment business and ecommerce and devices through innovations in these areas we expect to grow revenue via three principal strategies

distributors and resellers we license software to organizations under arrangements that allow the enduser customer to acquire multiple licenses of products organizations license our products primarily through large account resellers “lars” direct market resellers and valueadded resellers “vars” many organizations that license products through enterprise agreements “eas” transact directly with us with sales support from our enterprise software advisor channel partners these enterprise software advisors typically are also authorized as lars and operate as resellers for our other licensing programs although each type of reselling partner reaches organizations of all sizes lars are primarily engaged with large organizations and vars typically reach the breadth of small and mediumsized organizations some of our distributors include ingram micro and tech data and some of our largest resellers include cdw dell insight enterprises software house international and software spectrum our business solutions software offerings are licensed to enterprises through a global network of channel partners providing vertical solutions and specialized services we distribute our finished goods products primarily through independent nonexclusive distributors authorized replicators resellers and retail outlets individual consumers obtain our products primarily through retail outlets including best buy target and walmart we have a network of field sales representatives and field support personnel that solicits orders from distributors and resellers and provides product training and sales support 

our arrangements for organizations to acquire multiple licenses of products are designed to provide them with a means of doing so without having to acquire separate packaged product through retail channels in delivering organizational licensing arrangements to the market we use different programs designed to provide flexibility for organizations of various sizes while these programs may differ in various parts of the world generally they include 

open designed primarily for smalltomedium organizations 5 to over 250 licenses this program allows customers to acquire perpetual licenses and at the customer’s election rights to future versions of software products over a specified time period generally two years the offering that conveys rights to future versions of certain software product over the contract period is called software assurance software assurance also provides support tools and training to help customers deploy and use software efficiently under the open program customers can acquire licenses only or licenses with software assurance they can also renew software assurance upon the expiration of existing volume licensing agreements 

select designed primarily for mediumtolarge organizations greater than 250 licenses this program allows customers to acquire perpetual licenses and at the customer’s election software assurance which consists of rights to future versions of certain software products support tools and training over a specified time period generally three years similar to the open program customers can acquire licenses only acquire licenses with software assurance or renew software assurance upon the expiration of existing volume licensing agreements

 item 1a risk factors 

challenges to our business model may reduce our revenues and operating margins our business model has been based upon customers paying a fee to license software that we developed and distributed under this licensebased software model software developers bear the costs of converting original ideas into software products through investments in research and development offsetting these costs with the revenue received from the distribution of their products we believe the licensebased software model has had substantial benefits for users of software allowing them to rely on our expertise and the expertise of other software developers that have powerful incentives to develop innovative software that is useful reliable and compatible with other software and hardware in recent years 

  

 part i 

item 1a 

  

certain “open source” software business models have evolved into a growing challenge to our licensebased software model open source commonly refers to software whose source code is subject to a license allowing it to be modified combined with other software and redistributed subject to restrictions set forth in the license a number of commercial firms compete with us using an open source business model by modifying and then distributing open source software to end users at nominal cost and earning revenue on complementary services and products these firms do not have to bear the full costs of research and development for the software a prominent example of open source software is the linux operating system while we believe our products provide customers with significant advantages in security and productivity and generally have a lower total cost of ownership than open source software the popularization of the open source software model continues to pose a significant challenge to our business model including continuing efforts by proponents of open source software to convince governments worldwide to mandate the use of open source software in their purchase and deployment of software products to the extent open source software gains increasing market acceptance sales of our products may decline we may have to reduce the prices we charge for our products and revenue and operating margins may consequently decline 

another development is the softwareasaservice business model by which companies provide applications data and related services over the internet providers use primarily advertising or subscriptionbased revenue models recent advances in computing and communications technologies have made this model viable and enabled the rapid growth of some of our competitors we are devoting significant resources toward developing our own softwareasaservice strategies it is uncertain whether these strategies will prove successful 

we face intense competition we continue to experience intense competition across all markets for our products and services our competitors range in size from fortune 100 companies to small specialized singleproduct businesses and open source communitybased projects while we believe the breadth of our businesses and product portfolio offers benefits to our customers that are a competitive advantage our competitors that are focused on a narrower product line may be more effective in devoting technical marketing and financial resources to compete with us in addition barriers to entry in our businesses generally are low the internet as a distribution channel and the noncommercial software model described above have reduced barriers to entry even further open source software vendors are devoting considerable efforts to developing software that mimics the features and functionality of our products in response to competitive factors we are developing versions of our products with basic functionality that are sold at lower prices than the standard versions these competitive pressures may result in decreased sales volumes price reductions andor increased operating costs such as for marketing and sales incentives resulting in lower revenue gross margins and operating income 

we may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights against piracy infringement of our patents by third parties or declining legal protection for intellectual property we defend our intellectual property rights and combat unlicensed copying and use of software and intellectual property rights through a variety of techniques preventing unauthorized use or infringement of our rights is difficult piracy of our products represents a loss of revenue to us while this adversely affects us revenue the impact on revenue from outside the united states is more significant particularly in countries where laws are less protective of intellectual property rights similarly the absence of harmonized patent laws makes it more difficult to ensure consistent respect for patent rights future legal changes could make this even more challenging throughout the world we actively educate consumers about the benefits of licensing genuine products and obtaining indemnification benefits for intellectual property risks and we educate lawmakers about the advantages of a business climate where intellectual property rights are protected however continued educational and enforcement efforts may fail to enhance revenue reductions in the legal protection for software intellectual property rights or compliance with additional intellectual property obligations impacting the rights of software developers could both adversely affect revenue 

third parties may claim we infringe their intellectual property rights from time to time we receive notices from others claiming we infringe their intellectual property rights the number of these claims may grow responding to these claims may require us to enter into royalty and licensing agreements on less favorable terms require us to stop selling or to redesign affected products or to pay damages or to satisfy indemnification commitments with our customers including contractual provisions under various license arrangements if we are required to enter into such agreements or take such actions our operating margins may decline as a result we have made and expect to continue making significant expenditures to settle claims related to the use of technology and intellectual property rights as part of our strategy to manage this risk 

  



part i 

item 1a 

  

we may not be able to protect our source code from copying if there is an unauthorized disclosure of source code source code the detailed program commands for our operating systems and other software programs is critical to our business while we license certain portions of our source code for various software programs and operating systems to a number of licensees we take significant measures to protect the secrecy of large portions of our source code if an unauthorized disclosure of a significant portion of our source code occurs we could potentially lose future trade secret protection for that source code the loss of future trade secret protection could make it easier for third parties to compete with our products by copying functionality which could adversely affect our revenue and operating margins unauthorized disclosure of source code could also increase certain risks described in the next paragraph 

security vulnerabilities in our products could lead to reduced revenues or to liability claims maintaining the security of computers and computer networks is a critical issue for us and our customers hackers develop and deploy viruses worms and other malicious software programs that attack our products while this is an industrywide problem that affects computers across all platforms it affects our products in particular because hackers tend to focus their efforts on the most popular operating systems and programs and we expect them to continue to do so we devote significant resources to address these critical issues we focus on engineering even more secure products enhancing security and reliability options and settings when we deliver products and providing guidance to help our customers make the best use of our products and services to protect against computer viruses and other attacks on their computing environment in addition we are working to improve the deployment of software updates to address security vulnerabilities discovered after our products are released we are also investing in mitigation technologies that help to secure customers from attacks even when such software updates are not deployed we advise customers on how to help protect themselves from security threats through the use of our online automated security tools our published security guidance and the deployment of security software such as firewalls antivirus and other security software the cost of these steps could reduce our operating margins despite these efforts actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products could lead some customers to seek to return products to reduce or delay future purchases or to use competing products customers may also increase their expenditures on protecting their existing computer systems from attack which could delay adoption of new technologies any of these actions by customers could adversely affect our revenue in addition actual or perceived vulnerabilities may lead to claims against us while our license agreements typically contain provisions that eliminate or limit our exposure to such liability there is no assurance these provisions will be held effective under applicable laws and judicial decisions 

we are subject to government litigation and regulatory activity that affects how we design and market our products as a leading global software maker we receive scrutiny from government agencies under us and foreign competition laws some jurisdictions also provide private rights of action for competitors or consumers based on alleged anticompetitive conduct for example we have been involved in the following actions 

lawsuits brought by the us department of justice 18 states and the district of columbia in two separate actions were resolved through a consent decree that took effect in november 2001 and a final judgment entered in november 2002 these proceedings imposed regulatory constraints on our windows operating system businesses including limits on certain contracting practices required disclosure of certain software program interfaces limits on microsoft’s ability to ensure the visibility of certain windows features in new pcs and required licensing of certain communications protocols while we believe we currently are in full compliance with the decree and judgment if we fail to comply with them in the future additional restrictions could be imposed on us that would adversely affect our business 

in march 2004 the european commission determined that we must create new versions of windows that do not include certain multimedia technologies many of which are required for certain web sites software applications and other aspects of windows to function properly and we must provide our competitors with specifications for how to implement certain communications protocols supported in windows microsoft has appealed both determinations to european courts as a result of the commission decision we have incurred and will absent a reversal of this ruling continue to incur duplicative development costs the commission ruling obligates microsoft to make available specifications for certain windows communications protocol technologies on licensing terms that are closely regulated by the commission the availability of these licenses may enable competitors to develop software products that better mimic the functionality of microsoft’s own products which could result in a reduction in sales of our products pending resolution of microsoft’s appeal there will remain uncertainty about the legal principles that govern

product design issues for future releases of microsoft products in europe these uncertainties could cause microsoft to modify product design and delay release dates for windows or other products 

in december 2005 the korean fair trade commission “kftc” completed an investigation of whether including streaming media technology or instant messenger technology in windows or including windows media services as an optional component of windows server violates the korean fair trade law the kftc ruled that we had violated the law and issued a remedial order requiring us to offer two versions of windows pc operating systems one with windows media player and instant messenger removed and another with those functionalities but also including opportunities for oems to install competing media player and instant messenger programs if upheld on appeal these remedies could adversely affect the utility and competitive position of windows pc operating systems in the korean market 

we believe our integrated approach to delivery of product innovation benefits consumers and business current or future government regulatory efforts and court decisions may hinder or delay our ability to provide these benefits thereby reducing the attractiveness of our products and the revenues that come from them moreover there always remains the risk of new legal action either by these or other governments or private claimants including with respect to products or features that haven’t been scrutinized or been the subject of objections in the past the outcome of such legal actions could adversely affect us in a variety of ways including 

 

  

  

  

  

 our online offerings are subject to government regulation of the internet domestically and internationally in areas such as user privacy data protection and online content the application of these laws and regulations to our business is often unclear and sometimes may conflict compliance with these regulations may involve significant costs or require changes in business practices that result in reduced revenue noncompliance could result in penalties being imposed on us or orders that we cease conducting the noncompliant activity 

our business depends largely on our ability to attract and retain talented employees our business is based on successfully attracting and retaining talented employees the market for highly skilled workers in our industry is extremely competitive we are limited in our ability to recruit internationally by restrictive domestic immigration laws if we are less successful in our recruiting efforts or if we are unable to retain key employees our ability to develop and deliver successful products and services may be adversely affected 

delays in product development schedules may adversely affect our revenues the development of software products is a complex and timeconsuming process new products and enhancements to existing products can require long development and testing periods significant delays in new product releases or significant problems in creating new products could adversely affect our revenue 

we make significant investments in new products and services that may not be profitable we have made and will continue to make significant investments in research development and marketing for new products services and technologies including windows vista the 2007 microsoft office system xbox 360 msn search windows server and windows live investments in new technology are inherently speculative commercial success depends on many factors including innovativeness developer support and effective distribution and marketing significant revenue from new product and service investments may not be achieved for a number of years if at all moreover new products and services may not be profitable and even if they are profitable operating margins for new products and businesses may not be as high as the margins we have experienced historically

declines in demand for software could occur if overall market demand for pcs servers and other computing devices declines significantly or consumer or corporate spending for such products declines our revenue will be adversely affected in addition our revenue would be unfavorably impacted if customers reduce their purchases of new software products or upgrades to existing products because new product offerings are not perceived as providing significant new functionality or other value to prospective purchasers we are making significant investments in windows vista and the 2007 microsoft office system if these products are not perceived as offering significant new functionality or value to prospective purchasers our revenue and operating margins could be adversely affected 

we have claims and lawsuits against us that may result in adverse outcomes we are subject to a variety of claims and lawsuits adverse outcomes in some or all of the claims pending against us may result in significant monetary damages or injunctive relief against us that could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business while management currently believes that resolving all of these matters individually or in the aggregate will not have a material adverse impact on our financial position or results of operations the litigation and other claims are subject to inherent uncertainties and management’s view of these matters may change in the future there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on our financial position and the results of operations for the period in which the effect of an unfavorable final outcome becomes probable and reasonably estimable 

we may have additional tax liabilities we are subject to income taxes in both the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes in the ordinary course of our business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain we are regularly under audit by tax authorities although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals based on the results of an audit or litigation a material effect on our income tax provision net income or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made could result 

we may be at risk of having insufficient supplies of certain xbox 360 components or console inventory some components of the xbox 360 are obtained from a single supplier and others may be subject to an industrywide supply shortage if a component delivery from a solesource supplier is delayed or becomes unavailable or industry shortages occur we may be unable to obtain replacement supplies on a timely basis resulting in reduced console and game sales components are ordered based on forecasted console demand so we may experience component shortages for the xbox 360 or alternatively excess console inventory that may require us to record charges to cost of revenue xbox 360 consoles will be assembled in asia disruptions in the supply chain may result in console shortages that would affect our revenues and operating margins 

if our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets become impaired we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings under generally accepted accounting principles we review our amortizable intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable goodwill is required to be tested for impairment at least annually factors that may be considered a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets may not be recoverable include a decline in stock price and market capitalization reduced future cash flow estimates and slower growth rates in our industry we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings in our financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets is determined negatively impacting our results of operations 

changes in accounting may affect our reported earnings and operating income generally accepted accounting principles and accompanying accounting pronouncements implementation guidelines and interpretations for many aspects of our business such as revenue recognition for software accounting for investments and treatment of goodwill or amortizable intangible assets are highly complex and involve subjective judgments changes in these rules or their interpretation or changes in our products or business could significantly change our reported earnings and operating income and could add significant volatility to those measures without a comparable underlying change in cash flow from operations see note 1 in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” and “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – critical accounting policies” of this report

require that we reduce the sales price of our software in the united states and other countries operations outside of the united states may be affected by changes in trade protection laws policies and measures and other regulatory requirements affecting trade and investment unexpected changes in regulatory requirements for software social political labor or economic conditions in a specific country or region and difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations while we hedge a portion of our international currency exposure significant fluctuations in exchange rates between the us dollar and foreign currencies may adversely affect our net revenues 

general economic and geopolitical risks may affect our revenue and profitability inflation softness in corporate information technology spending or other changes in general economic conditions that affect demand for computer hardware or software could adversely affect our revenue or our investment portfolio abrupt political change terrorist activity and armed conflict pose a risk of general economic disruption in affected countries or generally and could require changes in our operations and security arrangements thus increasing our operating costs these conditions may lend additional uncertainty to the timing and budget for technology investment decisions by our customers 

catastrophic events may disrupt our business we are a highly automated business and a disruption or failure of our systems in the event of a major earthquake cyberattack terrorist attack or other catastrophic event could cause delays in completing sales and providing services our corporate headquarters a significant portion of our research and development activities and certain other critical business operations are located in the seattle washington area and we have other business operations in the silicon valley area of california both of which are near major earthquake faults a catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our critical business or information technology systems could severely affect our ability to conduct normal business operations and as a result our future operating results could be adversely affected 

acquisitions and joint ventures may have an adverse effect on our business we expect to continue making acquisitions or entering into joint ventures as part of our longterm business strategy these transactions involve significant challenges and risks including that the transaction does not advance our business strategy that we don’t realize a satisfactory return on the investment we make or that we may experience difficulty in the integration of new employees business systems and technology or diversion of management’s attention from our other businesses these factors could adversely affect our operating results or financial condition 

we have limited insurance we maintain third party insurance coverage against various liability risks and risks of property loss because of the unavailability or high cost of conventional insurance arrangements we have entered into captive insurance arrangements for the purpose of protecting against possible catastrophic and other risks not covered by traditional insurance markets as of june 30 2006 the face value of captive insurance arrangements was 20 billion actual value at any particular time will vary due to deductibles exclusions other restrictions and claims while we believe these arrangements are an effective way to insure against liability and property damage risks the potential liabilities associated with the risks discussed in this report or other events could exceed the coverage provided by such arrangements 

improper disclosure of personal data could result in liability and harm our reputation we store and process significant amounts of personally identifiable information as we offer a large array of products and services to our customers it is possible that our security controls over personal data our training of employees and vendors on data security and other practices we follow may not prevent the improper disclosure of personally identifiable information such disclosure could harm our reputation and subject us to liability under laws that protect personal data resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue our software products also enable our customers to store and process personal data perceptions that our products do not adequately protect the privacy of personal information could inhibit sales of our products

our revenue historically has fluctuated quarterly and has generally been the highest in the second quarter of our fiscal year due to corporate calendar yearend spending trends in our major markets and holiday season spending by consumers our home and entertainment segment is particularly subject to seasonality as its products are aimed at the consumer market and are in highest demand during the holiday shopping season typically home and entertainment has generated over 40 of its yearly segment revenues in our second fiscal quarter we believe the seasonality of revenue is likely to continue in the future 

we intend to sustain the longterm growth of our businesses through technological innovation engineering excellence and a commitment to delivering highquality products and services to customers and partners recognizing that one of our primary challenges is to help accelerate worldwide pc adoption and software upgrades we continue to advance the functionality security and value of windows operating systems we also are increasing our focus on emerging markets and reducing the amount of unlicensed software in those markets in addition we continue to develop innovative software applications and solutions that we believe will enhance the productivity of information workers improve communication and collaboration in work groups aid business intelligence and streamline processes for small and midsized businesses to sustain the growth of our server and tools business amid competition from other vendors of both proprietary and open source software our goal is to deliver products that provide the best platform for network computing – the easiest to deploy and manage and most secure – with the lowest total cost of ownership 

we continue to invest in research and development in existing and new lines of business including business solutions mobile computing communication entertainment and others that we believe may contribute to our longterm growth we also research and develop advanced technologies for future software products we believe that delivering innovative and highvalue solutions through our integrated platform is the key to meeting customer needs and to our future growth

worldwide macroeconomic factors have a strong correlation to business and consumer demand for our software services games and internet service offerings we expect a broad continuation in the economic conditions and demand in fiscal year 2007 as compared to fiscal year 2006 

as open source software development and distribution evolves we continue to seek to differentiate our products from competing products that are based on open source software we believe that microsoft’s share of server unit operating systems increased in fiscal year 2006 

summary of results for fiscal years 2006 2005 and 2004 

 

 our revenue growth for fiscal year 2006 was driven primarily by growth in sql server following the launch of sql server 2005 in the second quarter windows server and other server applications increased xbox revenue resulting from the xbox 360 launch in the second quarter growth in licensing of windows client operating systems through oems and increased licensing of office and other information worker products based on our estimates total worldwide pc shipments from all sources grew approximately 12 to 14 and total server hardware shipments grew approximately 11 to 13 during fiscal year 2006 foreign currency exchange rates did not have a significant impact on consolidated or operating segment revenue during the fiscal year 

revenue growth for fiscal year 2005 was driven by growth in licensing of windows server operating systems and other server applications licensing of windows client operating systems through oems and increased licensing of office and other information worker products the november 2004 launch of the “halo 2” xbox game also contributed to overall revenue growth for the company total worldwide pc shipments from all sources grew approximately 11 to 13 and total server hardware shipments grew approximately 13 to 14 during fiscal year 2005 as compared to fiscal year 2004 the net impact of foreign exchange rates on revenue was positive in 2005 primarily due to relative strengthening of most foreign currencies particularly the euro and japanese yen against the us dollar partially offsetting revenue growth rates was a 108 billion decline in earned revenue from upgrade advantage in fiscal year 2005 this revenue was recognized over fiscal year 2003 and fiscal year 2004 and in the first quarter of fiscal year 2005 when the contract period expired fiscal year 2004 revenue growth was primarily driven by the growth in licensing of windows client operating systems through oems windows server operating systems office and other server applications as a result of growth in pc and server hardware shipments the worldwide pc shipment growth rate from all sources was estimated at 13 and the windows server shipment was estimated at 18 in fiscal year 2004 as compared to fiscal year 2003 the net impact of foreign exchange rates on revenue was positive in fiscal year 2004 due to a relative strengthening of most foreign currencies versus the us dollar this resulted in approximately 110 billion growth in total revenue 

operating income for fiscal year 2006 increased primarily reflecting the revenue increase and a 991 million decrease in costs for legal settlements and legal contingencies these changes were partially offset by a 162 billion increase in cost of revenue primarily related to xbox 360 and a 126 billion increase in sales and marketing expense primarily as a result of increased investments in partner marketing and product launchrelated spending headcountrelated costs including stockbased compensation expense increased 682 million or 7 resulting from both an increase in salaries and benefits for existing headcount and a 16 growth in headcount over the past twelve months stockbased compensation expense decreased 733 million or 30 reflecting a continuing decline in stock option amortization expense 

operating income increased in fiscal year 2005 due to a decline in stockbased compensation expense increased revenue in server and tools client and information worker which have higher gross margins as compared to other segments and a reduction in legal costs associated with major litigation in addition strong sales of halo 2 reduced the overall operating loss for the home and entertainment segment for fiscal year 2005 the 329 billion decrease in stockbased compensation expense was partially offset by increased operating expenses of 562 million related to increased salary and benefits for new and existing headcount general and administrative expenses related to major litigation declined in fiscal year 2005 due to the 253 billion of charges related to the settlement of sun

item 7 

  

microsystems litigation and the fine imposed by the european commission in fiscal year 2004 this effect was partially offset by legal expenses of 208 billion related to settlements with ibm novell gateway and enduser class action plaintiffs to resolve antitrust issues and other matters in fiscal year 2004 the operating income decline was caused primarily by 253 billion of legal charges and 221 billion of stockbased compensation expense related to our employee stock option transfer program mainly offset by an increase in revenue 

we implemented changes in employee compensation in fiscal year 2004 whereby employees are granted stock awards rather than stock options we also completed an employee stock option transfer program in the second quarter of fiscal year 2004 in which employees could elect to transfer all of their vested and unvested stock options with a strike price of 3300 or higher to jpmorgan chase bank “jpmorgan” the unvested options that were transferred to jpmorgan became vested upon the transfer a total of 345 million of the 621 million eligible options were transferred which resulted in additional stockbased compensation expense of 221 billion in the second quarter of fiscal year 2004 as a result of these changes stockbased compensation expense decreased in fiscal years 2006 and 2005 and we expect stockbased compensation expense related to stock options to continue to decrease in fiscal year 2007 

fiscal year 2007 outlook 

in fiscal year 2007 we expect continued double digit revenue growth primarily as a result of the upcoming launches of windows vista and the 2007 microsoft office system we estimate worldwide pc shipments will grow between 8 and 10 we expect that pc unit growth rates will be higher in the consumer segment than in the business segment and higher in emerging markets than in mature markets we estimate worldwide server unit shipments will grow between 10 and 12 in fiscal year 2007 as compared to fiscal year 2006 we do not expect a significant impact from yearoveryear foreign currency exchange rates in fiscal year 2007 

we expect our operating income growth rate to lag our revenue growth rate in the first half of fiscal year 2007 due to an increasing mix of xbox 360 console revenue and related costs coupled with significant investments in preparation for the launches of our flagship products we expect this trend to reverse in the second half of the fiscal year when we expect operating income to grow faster than revenue 

segment product revenueoperating income loss 

our seven segments were client server and tools information worker microsoft business solutions msn mobile and embedded devices and home and entertainment on july 17 2006 we announced a change in our operating segments reflecting the culmination of our realignment announced in september 2005 these changes will be effective for fiscal year 2007 the seven segments discussed in this analysis are presented the way we internally managed and monitored performance at the business group level in fiscal years 2006 2005 and 2004

our historical results under this new segmentation for the four quarters in fiscal years 2006 and 2005 were as follows 

revenue 

 

 operating income  loss 

 

 our outlook for fiscal year 2007 based on the five operating segments is as follows 

client we expect revenue to grow reflecting improvement in the commercial and retail portion of the business due to our upcoming launch of windows vista we expect revenue generated from oems to grow slower than the pc hardware market due to increased concentration among larger oems consumer hardware shipments growing faster than business shipments and relatively faster growth in emerging markets we expect pc shipments to grow 8 to 10 for fiscal year 2007 we believe that pc unit growth rates will be higher in the consumer segment than in the business segment and higher in emerging markets than in mature markets 

server and tools we expect continued momentum from recent product launches and the expansion of our products in security management and designer tools will help drive our overall revenue growth in fiscal year 2007 we estimate overall server hardware unit shipments will grow 10 to 12 in fiscal year 2007 however we face competition from linuxbased unix and other server operating systems as well as competition in server applications

investment income and other 

the components of investment income and other were as follows 

 

 for fiscal year 2006 dividends and interest income increased due to higher interest rates received on our fixedincome investments partially offset by a decline in the average balance of dividend and interestbearing investments as a result of the 3264 billion special dividend paid on december 2 2004 and stock repurchases made throughout fiscal year 2006 dividends and interest income declined 432 million in fiscal year 2005 due to the combination of a greater allocation of funds to lower yielding more liquid asset classes in preparation for the 3264 billion special dividend paid on december 2 2004 and a lower portfolio balance following payment of the special dividend 

for fiscal year 2006 net recognized gains on investments were comprised of net gains on sales of equity investments net losses on sales of fixedincome investments and otherthantemporary impairments on both equity and fixedincome investments net recognized gains decreased in fiscal year 2006 primarily due to increased net losses on sales of fixedincome investments higher otherthantemporary impairments and fewer net gains on equity investments in the current period as compared to fiscal year 2005 for fiscal year 2006 otherthantemporary impairments were 408 million as compared to 152 million in fiscal year 2005 the increase in otherthantemporary impairments in fiscal year 2006 was driven by planned sales of certain investments in an unrealized loss position in order to raise funds for the 20 billion tender offer announced on july 20 2006 net gains on investments declined 707 million in fiscal year 2005 primarily due to greater sales of investments in the previous fiscal year in preparation for the special dividend paid on december 2 2004 net gains on investments also include otherthantemporary impairments of 152 million in fiscal year 2005 compared to 82 million in fiscal year 2004 net realized gains on sales were 165 billion in fiscal year 2004 as we moved to more liquid investment asset classes 

investments are considered to be impaired when a decline in fair value is judged to be other than temporary we employ a systematic methodology that considers available evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments if the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value among other factors we evaluate general market conditions the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost and our intent and ability to hold the investment we also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the investee including industry and sector performance changes in technology operational and financing cash flow factors and rating agency actions once a decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary an impairment charge is recorded and a new cost basis in the investment is established 

we lend certain fixedincome and equity securities to enhance investment income the loaned securities continue to be carried as investments on our balance sheet 

we use derivative instruments to manage exposures to interest rates equity prices and foreign currency markets and to facilitate portfolio diversification net losses on derivatives were as follows 

 

 during fiscal year 2006 we experienced lower net losses on derivatives as compared to fiscal year 2005 primarily due to net gains on nondesignated equity derivatives in the current fiscal year as compared to net losses in the prior

item 7 

  

fiscal year and higher net gains on commodity positions in the current fiscal year driven by increases in the related commodity indices these gains were partially offset by higher net losses in time value on foreign exchange contracts used to hedge anticipated foreign currency revenues and higher net losses on interest rate derivative contracts 

the net gains on equity derivatives during fiscal year 2006 are primarily due to changes in the market value of nondesignated equity derivatives gains and losses arising from nondesignated derivatives are economically offset by unrealized losses and gains respectively in the underlying equity securities which are recorded as a component of other comprehensive income commodity derivatives are held for the purpose of portfolio diversification net losses related to foreign currency contracts relate primarily to changes in time value of options used to hedge anticipated foreign currency revenues additionally net gains and losses on foreign exchange contracts include the changes in the fair value of derivatives used as economic hedges these gains and losses are partially offset economically by unrealized losses and gains respectively in the underlying assets which are included in other comprehensive income 

net derivative losses in fiscal year 2005 were primarily related to losses on equity derivatives interest rate derivatives and foreign currency contracts during fiscal year 2005 losses related to equity derivatives used to economically hedge against a decline in equity prices were 202 million and losses related to interest rate derivatives were 53 million these losses were offset by the combination of realized gains on sales of securities and unrealized gains related to increases in the market value of the underlying assets included as a component of other comprehensive income net losses related to foreign currency contracts were 53 million related to changes in time value of options used to hedge anticipated foreign currency revenues and economically hedging foreign currency based investment exposures losses related to hedging foreign currencybased investment exposures were offset by unrealized gains in the underlying assets which are included in other comprehensive income net losses on derivatives also included gains related to commodity positions used to provide portfolio diversification gains on commodity positions were 46 million during fiscal year 2005 

derivative losses were 268 million in fiscal year 2004 primarily due to net losses in time value on foreign exchange contracts used to hedge anticipated foreign currency revenues 

in the second quarter of fiscal year 2006 we entered into an agreement with nbc universal inc “nbc” that restructured our joint venture relationships for msnbc cable llc “cjv” and msnbc interactive news llc “ijv” as a result we divested 32 of cjv for 331 million and nbc acquired the right exercisable in the following two years to buy the remaining 18 interest in addition we modified our agreement with nbc to grant to ijv a us content license and to remove the exclusivity obligation on both nbc and microsoft for local and nonus news content as part of the msnbc restructuring agreements we paid a 200 million fee to effectively terminate ijv’s prior content license agreement and we also prepaid the remaining 14 million license fee to nbc in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2006 nbc exercised its option to buy our remaining 18 interest in cjv for fiscal year 2006 we recognized a net gain of 195 million related to the above transactions 

income taxes 

our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2006 was 31 as compared to 26 for fiscal year 2005 during fiscal year 2006 we recorded a tax benefit of 108 million from the resolution of state audits the increased rate in fiscal year 2006 resulted primarily from the european commission fine of € 281 million 351 million which is not tax deductible and a lower rate in fiscal year 2005 as a result of reversal of 776 million of previously accrued taxes upon settling an internal revenue service examination for fiscal year 1997 – 1999 and a tax benefit of 179 million generated by the decision to repatriate foreign subsidiary earnings under a temporary incentive provided by the american jobs creation act of 2004 our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2004 was 33 

financial condition 

cash and equivalents and shortterm investments totaled 3416 billion and 3775 billion as of june 30 2006 and 2005 respectively this investment portfolio consists primarily of fixedincome securities diversified among industries and individual issuers our investments are generally liquid and investment grade the portfolio is invested predominantly in usdollardenominated securities but also includes foreign currency positions in order to diversify financial risk the portfolio is primarily invested in shortterm securities to facilitate rapid deployment for immediate cash needs equity and other investments were 923 billion and 1100 billion as of june 30 2006 and 2005 respectively as a result of the special dividend paid in the second quarter of fiscal year 2005 and shares repurchased our retained deficit including accumulated other comprehensive income was 1890 billion at june 30 2006 our retained deficit is not expected to impact our future ability to operate or pay dividends given our continuing profitability and strong cash and financial position

unearned revenue 

unearned revenue from volume licensing programs represents customer billings paid either upfront or annually at the beginning of each billing coverage period that are accounted for as subscriptions with revenue recognized ratably over the billing coverage period for certain other licensing arrangements revenue attributable to undelivered elements including free postdelivery telephone support and the right to receive unspecified upgradesenhancements of microsoft internet explorer on a whenandifavailable basis is based on the sales price of those elements when sold separately and is recognized ratably on a straightline basis over the life cycle of the related product other unearned revenue includes services tv platform microsoft business solutions advertising and subscriptions for which we have been paid upfront and earn the revenue when we provide the service or software or otherwise meet the revenue recognition criteria 

unearned revenue as of june 30 2006 increased 174 billion from june 30 2005 reflecting additions to unearned revenue from multiyear licensing that outpaced recognitions by 166 billion a 53 million decrease in revenue deferred for undelivered elements and a 127 million increase primarily in unearned revenue for services and subscription services 

the following table outlines the expected recognition of 109 billion of unearned revenue as of june 30 2006 

 

 cash flows 

cash flow from operations for fiscal year 2006 decreased 13 to 1440 billion primarily due to increased payments to fund a 987 million increase in inventory and product costs related to xbox 360 and increased payments to employees resulting from a 16 growth in headcount these factors were partially offset by increased cash receipts from customers driven by our 11 revenue growth and 174 billion increase in unearned revenue cash used in financing was 2056 billion in fiscal year 2006 a decrease of 2052 billion from the previous year driven by a 3257 billion reduction in cash dividend payments this impact was partially offset by an 1115 billion increase in common stock repurchases net cash from investing was 800 billion in fiscal year 2006 a decrease of 702 billion from fiscal year 2005 driven primarily by an 893 billion decrease in cash from combined purchase sales and maturities of investments and a 766 million increase in additions to property and equipment these factors were partially offset by 312 billion of cash proceeds from our securities lending program 

cash flow from operations for fiscal year 2005 increased 14 to 1661 billion primarily due to an increase in cash receipts from customers driven by our 8 revenue growth combined with a 12 increase in unearned revenue cash payments in fiscal year 2005 resulting from significant legal settlements were approximately 18 billion lower than in the previous year adding to the overall increase in operating cash flow partially offsetting these factors were increased payments to employees resulting from a 7 increase in fulltime employees cash used for financing was 4108 billion in fiscal year 2005 driven by 3611 billion of cash dividends paid in fiscal year 2005 compared to 173 billion paid in fiscal year 2004 the increase was also partially driven by 806 billion in cash used for common stock repurchases an increase of 467 billion in cash used for share repurchases compared to the previous year reflecting 312 million shares repurchased in fiscal year 2005 an increase of 1885 million shares compared to the previous year net cash from investing was 1503 billion in fiscal year 2005 an increase of 1837 billion from fiscal year 2004 primarily due to a 2359 billion increase in investment maturities that occurred to fund cash dividends paid in fiscal year 2005 partially offset by a 532 billion decrease in cash from combined investment purchase and sale activity

cash flow from operations for fiscal year 2004 decreased 117 billion to 1463 billion the decrease primarily reflects the combined cash outflows of 256 billion related to the sun microsystems settlement and the european commission fine partially offset by increased cash receipts from customers driven by the rise in revenue billings cash used for financing was 236 billion in fiscal year 2004 a decrease of 286 billion from the previous year the decrease reflects that we did not repurchase common stock in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2004 combined with a 628 million increase primarily from stock issuances related to employee stock options exercises partially offset by an 872 million increase in cash dividends paid we repurchased 1237 million shares of common stock under our share repurchase program in fiscal year 2004 cash used for investing was 334 billion in fiscal year 2004 a decrease of 388 billion from fiscal year 2003 

we have no material longterm debt stockholders’ equity at june 30 2006 was 4010 billion we will continue to invest in sales marketing product support infrastructure and existing and advanced areas of technology additions to property and equipment will continue including new facilities and computer systems for research and development sales and marketing support and administrative staff commitments for constructing new buildings were 234 million on june 30 2006 we have operating leases for most us and international sales and support offices and certain equipment under which we incurred rental expense totaling 276 million 299 million and 331 million fiscal year 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively we have issued residual value guarantees in connection with various operating leases these guarantees provide that if we do not purchase the leased property from the lessor at the end of the lease term then we are liable to the lessor for an amount equal to the shortage if any between the proceeds from the sale of the property and an agreed value as of june 30 2006 the maximum amount of the residual value guarantees was approximately 271 million we believe that proceeds from the sale of properties under operating leases would exceed the payment obligation and therefore no liability currently exists we have not engaged in any related party transactions or arrangements with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect liquidity or the availability of requirements for capital resources 

in fiscal year 2006 our board of directors declared 035 per share cash dividends with 269 billion paid as of june 30 2006 a quarterly dividend of 009 per share or 906 million was declared by our board of directors on june 21 2006 to be paid to shareholders of record as of august 17 2006 on september 14 2006

we believe existing cash and shortterm investments together with funds generated from operations should be sufficient to meet operating requirements quarterly dividends and planned share repurchases our philosophy regarding the maintenance of a balance sheet with a large component of cash and shortterm investments and equity and other investments reflects our views on potential future capital requirements relating to research and development creation and expansion of sales distribution channels investments and acquisitions share dilution management legal risks and challenges to our business model we regularly assess our investment management approach in view of our current and potential future needs

sfas no 142 goodwill and other intangible assets  requires that goodwill be tested for impairment at the reporting unit level operating segment or one level below an operating segment on an annual basis july 1 for us and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value these events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate legal factors operating performance indicators competition or sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment including the identification of reporting units assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units assignment of goodwill to reporting units and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit the fair value of each reporting unit is estimated using a discounted cash flow methodology this requires significant judgments including estimation of future cash flows which is dependent on internal forecasts estimation of the longterm rate of growth for our business the useful life over which cash flows will occur and determination of our weighted average cost of capital changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value andor goodwill impairment for each reporting unit we allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected benefit from the combination we evaluate our reporting units on an annual basis and if necessary reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach

the outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought against us are subject to significant uncertainty sfas no 5 accounting for contingencies requires that an estimated loss from a loss contingency such as a legal proceeding or claim should be accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated disclosure of a contingency is required if there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss has been incurred in determining whether a loss should be accrued we evaluate among other factors the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss changes in these factors could materially impact our financial position or our results of operations 

sfas no 109 accounting for income taxes  establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for the effect of income taxes the objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity’s financial statements or tax returns judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our financial position results of operations or cash flows accruals for tax contingencies are provided for in accordance with the requirements of sfas no 5

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to foreign currency interest rate fixedincome equity and commodity price risks a portion of these risks is hedged but fluctuations could impact our results of operations and financial position we hedge a portion of anticipated revenue and accounts receivable exposure to foreign currency fluctuations primarily with option contracts we monitor our foreign currency exposures daily to maximize the overall effectiveness of our foreign currency hedge positions principal currencies hedged include the euro japanese yen british pound and canadian dollar fixedincome securities are subject primarily to interest rate risk the portfolio is diversified and structured to minimize credit risk securities held in our equity and other investments portfolio are subject to price risk and are generally not hedged however we use options to hedge our price risk on certain equity securities that are held primarily for strategic purposes commodity derivatives held for the purpose of portfolio diversification are subject to commodity price risk 

we use a valueatrisk “var” model to estimate and quantify our market risks var is the expected loss for a given confidence level in fair value of our portfolio due to adverse market movements over a defined time horizon the var model is not intended to represent actual losses in fair value but is used as a risk estimation and management tool the model used for currencies equities and commodities is geometric brownian motion which allows incorporation of optionality with regard to these risk exposures for interest rate risk exposures such as key rate durations and spread durations are used in calculations that reflect the principle that fixedincome security prices revert to maturity value over time 

var is calculated by computing the exposures of each holding’s market value to a range of over 1000 equity fixedincome foreign exchange and commodity risk factors the exposures are then used to compute the parameters of a distribution of potential changes in the total market value of all holdings taking into account the weighted historical volatilities of the different rates and prices and the weighted historical correlations among the different rates and prices the var is then calculated as the total loss that will not be exceeded at the 975 percentile confidence level or alternatively stated the losses could exceed the var in 25 out of 1000 cases several risk factors are not captured in the model including liquidity risk operational risk credit risk and legal risk 

certain securities in our equity portfolio are held for strategic purposes we hedge the value of a portion of these securities through the use of derivative contracts such as putcall collars in these arrangements we hedge a security’s equity price risk below the purchased put strike and forgo most or all of the benefits of the security’s appreciation above the sold call strike in exchange for the premium received for the sold call we also hold equity securities for general investment return purposes we have incurred material impairment charges related to these securities in previous periods 

at the beginning of the second fiscal quarter of fiscal year 2006 we changed the methodology we use to calculate var we previously used a monte carlo simulationbased methodology to calculate var in the second quarter of fiscal year 2006 we adopted a factorbased parametric methodology the factorbased parametric methodology can be performed more frequently resulting in more timely data divides the aggregated var into its component risk factor groups and is incrementally more accurate than the previously used simulationbased methodology in evaluating diversification effects of commodity risk factors and interactions between equity and currency factors while we believe the efficiencies gained by changing to the parametric methodology are significant we do not believe this methodology produces results that are significantly different from the simulationbased methodology 

the var amounts disclosed below are used as a risk management tool and reflect an estimate of potential reductions in fair value of our portfolio losses in fair value over the specified holding period can exceed the reported var by significant amounts and can also accumulate over a longer time horizon than the specified holding period used in the var analysis var amounts are not necessarily reflective of potential accounting losses including determinations of otherthantemporary losses in fair value in accordance with us gaap 

var numbers are shown separately for interest rate currency rate equity price and commodity price risks these var numbers include the underlying portfolio positions and related hedges we use historical data to estimate var given the reliance on historical data var is most effective in estimating risk exposures in markets in which there are no fundamental changes or shifts in market conditions an inherent limitation in var is that the distribution of past changes in market risk factors may not produce accurate predictions of future market risk

competition 

  

every segment of the software business is competitive and subject to rapid technological change evolving customer requirements and changing business models we face significant competition in all areas of our business and intense competition in many of them because technology advances rapidly competitors can quickly render existing technologies less valuable customer requirements and preferences continually change as other information technologies emerge or become less expensive and as concerns such as security and privacy become more important 

our direct competitors include firms that have adopted the noncommercial software model these firms typically provide customers with open source software at nominal cost and earn their revenue on complementary services and products this approach allows these firms to compete without having to bear the full costs of software research and development 

in a sense we also compete with pirated copies of our own software global software piracy – the unlawful copying and distribution of our copyrighted software products – deprives us of significant amounts of revenue on an annual basis in addition future versions of our products compete with the existing versions which our licensed customers may choose to continue to use indefinitely this means that future versions must deliver significant additional value in order to induce existing customers to purchase a new version of our product 

our competitive position may be adversely affected by one or more of the factors described in this section or as yet unidentified additional factors that may arise 

  

client although we are the leader in pc operating system software products we face strong competition from wellestablished companies and entities with differing approaches to the market competing commercial software products including variants of unix are supplied by competitors such as ibm hewlettpackard apple computer sun microsystems and others which are vertically integrated in both software development and hardware manufacturing and have developed operating systems that they preinstall on their own computers personal computer oems who preinstall thirdparty operating systems may also license these firms’ operating systems the linux operating system which is also derived from unix and is available without payment under a general public license has gained increasing acceptance as competitive pressures lead personal computer oems to reduce costs the microsoft windows operating systems also face competition from alternative platforms and new devices that may reduce consumer demand for traditional personal computers competitors such as mozilla offer software that competes with the internet explorer web browsing capabilities of our windows operating system products apple computer real networks and many others compete with the media playback capabilities windows media player of our windows operating system products we believe current and future versions of these and other aspects of windows will continue to compete effectively with nonmicrosoft browsers media players and other nonmicrosoft programs on important attributes such as features functionality and security we believe our operating system products compete effectively by delivering innovative software an easytouse interface compatibility with a broad range of hardware and software applications and the largest support network for any operating system 

  

server and tools our server operating system products face intense competition from a wide variety of competing server operating systems and server applications offered by firms with a variety of market approaches vertically integrated computer manufacturers such as ibm hewlettpackard sun microsystems and others offer their own variant of unix preinstalled on server hardware and nearly all computer manufacturers offer server hardware for the linux operating system ibm’s endorsement of linux has accelerated its acceptance as an alternative to both traditional unix and windows server operating systems linux’s competitive position has also benefited from the large number of compatible applications now produced by many leading commercial software developers and noncommercial software developers a number of companies supply versions of linux including novell and red hat

we compete in the business of providing enterprisewide computing solutions with several companies that provide competing solutions and middleware technology platforms ibm and sun microsystems lead a group of companies focused on the java 2 platform enterprise edition j2ee commercial software developers that provide competing server applications for pcbased distributed clientserver environments include oracle ibm and computer associates 

numerous commercial software vendors offer competing commercial software applications for connectivity both internet and intranet security hosting and ebusiness servers in addition ibm has a large installed base of lotus notes and ccmail both of which compete with our collaboration and email products there are also a significant number of noncommercial software products that compete with our solutions including the widelydeployed apache web server 

our products for software developers compete against offerings from bea systems borland ibm macromedia oracle sun microsystems and other companies 

we believe that our server products provide customers with significant advantages in innovation performance total costs of ownership productivity applications development tools and environment compatibility with a broad base of hardware and software applications security and manageability 

  

information worker while we are the leader in business and personal productivity software applications for personal computers competitors to the microsoft office system include many software application vendors such as apple corel ibm oracle sun microsystems novell red hat and local application developers in europe and asia ibm smartsuite and corel wordperfect suite have significant installed bases with their office productivity products apple may preinstall certain of their application software products on various models of their pcs competing directly with our applications the openofficeorg project provides a freely downloadable crossplatform application that also has been adapted by various commercial software vendors sun novell red hat ibm and others to sell under their brand corel’s suite and many different local software suites around the world are aggressively priced for oems to preinstall on lowpriced pcs in addition to traditional clientside applications webbased offerings such as simdesk can also provide an alternative to microsoft office system products 

further as customers have increasingly demanded additional functionality and products including new server and service offerings additional vendors are competing in the information worker segment most notably in document management collaboration tools real time messaging and business intelligence as just one example microsoft competes with ibm broadly in messaging and collaboration with our approach that spans multiple information worker products we believe that our products compete effectively through ease of use improving users’ personal productivity providing tools for effective teaming and collaboration better information management and control and for many customers a lower total cost of ownership than alternatives 

  

microsoft business solutions the products of microsoft business solutions are targeted at small and midsized businesses smb and larger organizations and divisions of global enterprises the smb segment for business solutions is highly fragmented with many companies in this business wellknown vendors focused on providing solutions for small and midsized businesses such as intuit and sage compete against us for a portion of this segment the segment consisting of large organizations and divisions of global enterprises continues to be intensely competitive with a small number of primary vendors providing products and services such as sap oraclepeoplesoft and siebel in addition these large enterprisefocused vendors are repositioning some of their business applications to focus on the smb segment and divisions of global enterprises and thus also compete against us for a portion of the market opportunity our business solution products also compete with hosted solutions offered by companies such as salesforcecom in addition there are thousands of other vendors in specific localities or industries that offer their own solutions we believe that our business solutions across financial management supply chain management and customer relationship management crm compete effectively in our target segments by offering integrated solutions that address multiple segment needs across industries and vertical markets through consistent innovation that are delivered through a growing network of partners and independent software vendors isvs

in searchbased advertising as a result competitors are aggressively developing internet services that provide enhanced functionality for end users in communication services improvements in information services such as internet search and advertising infrastructure and support services including more effective ways of connecting advertisers with audiences we have built our own algorithmic search engine to provide end users with more relevant search results broader selection of content and expanded set of search services and we are investing to support the continued growth of our advertising business we are also investing in our communication services and our technology operations and sales efforts to support the continued growth of our advertising business we will continue to introduce new products and services aimed at attracting additional users by improving the user experience in an effort to increase our satisfaction levels with our end users and merchant customers due to the continuing trend of consumers migrating from narrowband to broadband internet access we expect our narrowband internet access subscriber base to continue to decline we believe that we can compete effectively across the breadth of our internet services by providing users with software innovation in the form of information and communication services that help them find discover and experience what they want online and by providing merchants with effective advertising results through improved systems and sales support

home and entertainment the home and entertainment business is highly competitive and is characterized by limited platform life cycles frequent introductions of new products and titles and the development of new technologies the markets for our products are characterized by significant price competition we anticipate continued pricing pressure from our competitors from time to time we have responded to this pressure by reducing prices on certain products our competitors vary in size from very small companies with limited resources to very large diversified corporations with substantial financial and marketing resources we compete primarily on the basis of price product quality and variety timing of product releases and effectiveness of distribution and marketing 

our xbox hardware business competes with console platforms from nintendo and sony both of which have a large established base of customers the video game consoles have on average 5 to 7 year lifecycles we have announced the expected release in the first half of fiscal year 2006 of a new console the xbox 360 sony and nintendo have also announced new versions of their game consoles success in this transition to the next generation of consoles depends on the computational power of the console the ease of developing games for the console the ability to provide new revenue sources such as advertising and downloadable content and providing exclusive game content that is sought after by gamers we believe the xbox 360 is positioned well against competitive console products based on significant innovation in the hardware architecture new developer tools expanded revenue sources and continued strong exclusive content from our 1 st party game franchises such as halo 

in addition to competing against software published for nonxbox platforms our games business also competes with numerous companies that have been licensed by us to develop and publish software for the xbox console these competitors include acclaim entertainment activision atari capcom eidos electronic arts sega taketwo interactive tecmo thq and ubi soft among others our pc hardware products face aggressive competition from computer and other hardware manufacturers many of which are also current or potential partners our mstv business faces competition primarily from ad hoc pointsolutions that address subsegments of the tv delivery platform but do not provide endtoend solutions for the network operator our largest mstv competitors include ibm cisco utstarcom and siemensmyrio

 risk factors 

  

challenges to our business model may reduce our revenues and operating margins our business model is based upon customers agreeing to pay a fee to license software developed and distributed by us under this commercial software model software developers bear the costs of converting original ideas into software products through investments in research and development offsetting these costs with the revenue received from the distribution of their products we believe the commercial software model has had substantial benefits for users of software allowing them to rely on our expertise and the expertise of other software developers that have powerful incentives to develop innovative software that is useful reliable and compatible with other software and hardware in recent years a noncommercial software model has evolved that presents a growing challenge to the commercial software model under the noncommercial software model open source software produced by loosely associated groups of unpaid programmers and made available for license to end users without charge is distributed by firms at nominal cost that earn revenue on complementary services and products without having to bear the full costs of research and development for the open source software the most notable example of open source software is the linux operating system there is a wide variety of other open source software available such as open officeorg and eclipse while we believe our products provide customers with significant advantages in security and productivity and generally have a lower total cost of ownership than open source software the popularization of the noncommercial software model continues to pose a significant challenge to our business model including recent efforts by proponents of open source software to convince governments worldwide to mandate the use of open source software in their purchase and deployment of software products to the extent open source software gains increasing market acceptance sales of our products may decline we may have to reduce the prices we charge for our products and revenue and operating margins may consequently decline 

  

we face intense competition we continue to experience intense competition across all markets for our products and services our competitors range in size from fortune 100 companies to small singleproduct businesses that are highly specialized and open source communitybased projects while we believe the breadth of our businesses and product portfolio offers benefits to our customers that are a competitive advantage our competitors that are focused on a narrower product line may be more effective in devoting technical marketing and financial resources to compete with us in addition barriers to entry in our businesses generally are low the internet as a distribution channel and noncommercial software model described above have reduced barriers to entry even further noncommercial software vendors are devoting considerable efforts to developing software that mimics the features and functionality of various of our products in response to competitive factors we are developing versions of our products with basic functionality that are sold at lower prices than the standard versions see part i item 1 of this report for additional information about our competitors these competitive pressures may result in decreased sales volumes price reductions andor increased operating costs such as for marketing and sales incentives resulting in lower revenue gross margins and operating income 

  

we may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights against piracy infringement of our patents by third parties or declining legal protection for intellectual property we defend our intellectual property rights and combat unlicensed copying and use of software and intellectual property rights through a variety of techniques preventing unauthorized use or infringement of our rights is difficult piracy of our products represents a loss of revenue to us while this adversely affects us revenue the impact on revenue from outside the united states is more significant particularly in countries where laws are less protective of intellectual property rights similarly the absence of harmonized patent laws makes it more difficult to ensure consistent respect for patent rights moreover future legal changes could make this even more challenging throughout the world we actively educate consumers about the benefits of licensing genuine products and obtaining indemnification benefits for intellectual property risks and we educate lawmakers about the advantages of a business climate where intellectual property rights are protected however continued educational and enforcement efforts may not affect revenue positively and revenue could be adversely affected by reductions in the legal protection for intellectual property rights for software developers or by compliance with additional legal obligations impacting the intellectual property rights of software developers 

  

third parties may claim we infringe their intellectual property rights from time to time we receive notices from others claiming we infringe their intellectual property rights the number of these claims may grow responding to these claims may require us to enter into royalty and licensing agreements on less favorable terms require us to stop selling or to redesign affected products or to pay damages or to satisfy indemnification commitments with our customers including contractual provisions under various license arrangements if we are required to enter into such agreements or take such actions our operating margins may decline as a result we have made and expect to

continue making significant expenditures to acquire the use of technology and intellectual property rights including via crosslicenses of broad patent portfolios as part of our strategy to manage this risk 

  

we may not be able to protect our source code from copying if there is an unauthorized disclosure of source code source code the detailed program commands for our operating systems and other software programs is the most significant asset we own while we license certain portions of our source code for various software programs and operating systems to a number of licensees we take significant measures to protect the secrecy of large portions of our source code if an unauthorized disclosure of a significant portion of our source code occurs we could potentially lose future trade secret protection for that source code the loss of future trade secret protection could make it easier for third parties to compete with our products by copying functionality which could adversely affect our revenue and operating margins unauthorized disclosure of source code could also increase certain risks described in the next paragraph 

  

security vulnerabilities in our products could lead to reduced revenues or to liability claims maintaining the security of computers and computer networks is an issue of critical importance for us and our customers there are malicious hackers who develop and deploy viruses worms and other malicious software programs that attack our products while this is an industrywide phenomenon that affects computers across all platforms it affects our products in particular because hackers tend to focus their efforts on the most popular operating systems and programs and we expect them to continue to do so we devote significant resources to addressing these critical issues we are focusing our efforts on engineering even more secure products enhancing security and reliability options and settings when we deliver products and providing guidance to help our customers make the best use of our products and services to protect against computer viruses and other attacks on their computing environment in addition we are working to improve the deployment of software updates to address security vulnerabilities discovered after our products are released we are also investing in mitigation technologies that help to secure customers from attacks even when such software updates are not deployed we are also advising customers on how to help protect themselves from security threats through the use of our online automated security tools our published security guidance and the deployment of security software such as firewalls antivirus and other security software the cost of these steps could adversely affect our operating margins despite these efforts actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products could lead some customers to seek to return products to reduce or delay future purchases or to use competitive products customers may also increase their expenditures on protecting their existing computer systems from attack which could delay adoption of new technologies any of these actions by customers could adversely affect our revenue we devote significant resources to improving the security design and engineering of our software nevertheless actual or perceived vulnerabilities may lead to claims against us while our license agreements typically contain provisions that eliminate or limit our exposure to such liability claims there is no assurance these provisions will be held effective under applicable laws and judicial decisions 

  

we are subject to government regulatory activity that affects how we design and market our products lawsuits brought by the us department of justice 18 states and the district of columbia in two separate actions were resolved through a consent decree that took effect in november 2001 and a final judgment entered in november 2002 these proceedings imposed regulatory constraints on our windows operating system businesses including limits on certain contracting practices required disclosure of certain software program interfaces limits on microsoft’s ability to ensure the visibility of certain windows features in new pcs and required licensing of certain communications protocols while we believe we currently are in full compliance with the decree and judgment if we fail to comply with them in the future additional restrictions could be imposed on us that would adversely affect our business moreover there always remains the risk of new legal action either by governments or private claimants including with respect to products that haven’t been scrutinized in the past 

in march 2004 the european commission determined that we must create new versions of windows that do not include certain multimedia technologies many of which are required for certain web sites software applications and other aspects of windows to function properly and we must provide our competitors with specifications for how to implement certain communications protocols supported in windows microsoft has appealed both determinations to european courts as a result of the commission decision we have incurred and will continue to incur duplicative development costs absent a court decision to reverse or limit this aspect of the ruling the availability of these alternative versions of windows in the market also may cause confusion that harms our reputation including among consumers and with third party software and web site developers who rely on the functionality removed from these alternative versions the commission ruling obligates microsoft to make available specifications for certain windows communications protocol technologies on licensing terms that are closely regulated by the commission the 

  

 part i 

item 1 

  

availability of these licenses may enable competitors to develop software products that better mimic the functionality of microsoft’s own products which could result in a reduction in sales of our products unless reversed or limited on appeal the ruling of the european commission may be cited as a precedent in other proceedings that seek to limit our ability to continue to improve windows by adding new functionality in response to consumer demand the ruling also illustrates a risk that competition authorities in europe or elsewhere may authorize competitors to distribute implementations of microsoft communications protocols in source code form without proper contractual provisions to protect our intellectual property 

we believe our integrated approach to delivery of product innovation benefits consumers and business current or future government regulatory efforts may hinder our ability to provide these benefits reducing the attractiveness of our products and the revenues that come from them 

our online services are subject to government regulation of the internet domestically and internationally in areas such as user privacy data protection and online content the application of these laws and regulations to our business is often unclear and sometimes may conflict compliance with these regulations may involve significant costs or require changes in business practices that result in reduced revenue noncompliance could result in penalties being imposed on us or orders that we cease conducting the noncompliant activity 

  

our business depends largely on our ability to attract and retain talented employees our business is based on successfully attracting and retaining talented employees the market for highly skilled workers in our industry is extremely competitive we are limited in our ability to recruit internationally by restrictive domestic immigration laws if we are less successful in our recruiting efforts or if we are unable to retain key employees our ability to develop and deliver successful products and services may be adversely affected 

  

delays in product development schedules may adversely affect our revenues the development of software products is a complex and timeconsuming process new products and enhancements to existing products can require long development and testing periods significant delays in new product releases or significant problems in creating new products particularly any delays in the windows vista operating system could adversely affect our revenue 

  

we make significant investments in new products and services that may not be profitable we have made and will continue to make significant investments in research development and marketing for new products services and technologies including windows vista office 12 msn search sql server windows server and xbox 360 investments in new technology are inherently speculative commercial success depends on many factors including innovativeness developer support and effective distribution and marketing significant revenue from new product and service investments may not be achieved for a number of years if at all moreover new products and services may not be profitable and even if they are profitable operating margins for new products and businesses may not be as high as the margins we have experienced historically 

  

declines in demand for software could occur if overall market demand for pcs servers and other computing devices declines significantly or consumer or corporate spending for such products declines our revenue will be adversely affected in addition our revenue would be unfavorably impacted if customers reduce their purchases of new software products or upgrades to existing products because new product offerings are not perceived as providing significant new functionality or other value to prospective purchasers we are making significant investments in the next release of the windows operating system windows vista and the next release of the microsoft office system office 12 if these products are not perceived as offering significant new functionality or value to prospective purchasers our revenue and operating margins could be adversely affected 

  

we have claims and lawsuits against us that may result in adverse outcomes we are subject to a variety of claims and lawsuits adverse outcomes in some or all of the claims pending against us may result in significant monetary damages or injunctive relief against us that could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business while management currently believes that resolving all of these matters individually or in the aggregate will not have a material adverse impact on our financial position or results of operations the litigation and other claims noted above are subject to inherent uncertainties and management’s view of these matters may change in the future there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on our financial position and the results of operations for the period in which the effect of an unfavorable final outcome becomes probable and reasonably estimable 

  

we may have additional tax liabilities we are subject to income taxes in both the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes in the

ordinary course of our business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain we are regularly under audit by tax authorities although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different than that which is reflected in historical income tax provisions and accruals based on the results of an audit or litigation a material effect on our income tax provision net income or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made could result 

  

we may be at risk of having insufficient supplies of certain xbox 360 components or console inventory some components of the upcoming xbox 360 are obtained from a single supplier and others may be subject to an industry wide supply shortage if a component delivery from a solesource supplier is delayed or becomes unavailable or industry shortages occur we may be unable to obtain replacement supplies on a timely basis resulting in reduced console and game sales components are ordered based on forecasted console demand so we may experience component shortages for the xbox 360 similarly if our demand forecasts for the existing xbox console are inaccurate and exceed actual demand we may have excess console inventory that may require us to record charges to cost of revenue for the excess inventory xbox 360 consoles will be assembled in asia disruptions in the supply chain may result in console shortages that would affect our revenues and operating margins 

  

if our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets become impaired we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings under generally accepted accounting principles we review our amortizable intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable goodwill is required to be tested for impairment at least annually factors that may be considered a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets may not be recoverable include a decline in stock price and market capitalization future cash flows and slower growth rates in our industry we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings in our financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets is determined resulting in an impact on our results of operations 

  

changes in accounting may affect our reported earnings and operating income generally accepted accounting principles and accompanying accounting pronouncements implementation guidelines and interpretations for many aspects of our business such as revenue recognition for software accounting for financial instruments and treatment of goodwill or amortizable intangible assets are highly complex and involve subjective judgments changes in these rules their interpretation or changes in our products or business could significantly change our reported earnings and operating income and could add significant volatility to those measures without a comparable underlying change in cash flow from operations see note 1 in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” and “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – critical accounting policies” of this report 

  

we operate a global business that exposes us to additional risks we operate in over 100 countries and a significant part of our revenue comes from international sales pressure to make our pricing structure uniform might require that we reduce the sales price of our software in the united states and other countries operations outside of the united states may be affected by changes in trade protection laws policies and measures and other regulatory requirements affecting trade and investment unexpected changes in regulatory requirements for software social political labor or economic conditions in a specific country or region and difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations while we hedge a portion of our international currency exposure significant fluctuations in exchange rates between the us dollar and foreign currencies may adversely affect our future net revenues 

  

general economic and geopolitical risks may affect our revenue and profitability softness in corporate information technology spending or other changes in general economic conditions that affect demand for computer hardware or software could adversely affect our revenue abrupt political change terrorist activity and armed conflict pose a risk of general economic disruption in affected countries or generally and could require changes in our operations and security arrangements thus increasing our operating costs these conditions may lend additional uncertainty to the timing and budget for technology investment decisions by our customers 

  

catastrophic events may disrupt our business we are a highly automated business and a disruption or failure of our systems in the event of a major earthquake cyberattack terrorist attack or other catastrophic event could cause delays in completing sales and providing services our corporate headquarters a significant portion of our research and development activities and certain other critical business operations are located in the seattle washington area and we have other business operations in the silicon valley area of california both of which are near major

earthquake faults a catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our critical business or information technology systems could severely affect our ability to conduct normal business operations and as a result our future operating results could be adversely affected 

  

acquisitions and joint ventures may have an adverse effect on our business we expect to continue making acquisitions or entering into joint ventures as part of our longterm business strategy these transactions involve significant challenges and risks including that the transaction does not advance our business strategy that we don’t realize a satisfactory return on the investment we make or that we may experience difficulty in the integration of new employees business systems and technology or diversion of management’s attention from our other businesses these factors could adversely affect our operating results or financial condition 

  

we have limited insurance we maintain third party insurance coverage against various liability risks and risks of property loss because of the unavailability or high cost of conventional insurance arrangements we have entered into captive insurance arrangements for the purpose of protecting against possible catastrophic and other risks not covered by traditional insurance markets as of june 30 2005 the face value of captive insurance arrangements was 20 billion actual value at any particular time will vary due to deductibles exclusions other restrictions and claims while we believe these arrangements are an effective way to insure against liability and property damage risks the potential liabilities associated with the risks discussed in this report or other events could exceed the coverage provided by such arrangements

we develop manufacture license and support a wide range of software products for many computing devices our software products include operating systems for servers pcs and intelligent devices server applications for distributed computing environments information worker productivity applications business solutions applications and software development tools we provide consulting and product support services and we train and certify system integrators and developers we sell the xbox video game console and games pc games and pc peripherals online communication and information services are delivered through our msn portals and channels around the world 

our revenue historically has fluctuated quarterly and has generally been the highest in the second quarter of our fiscal year due to corporate calendar yearend spending trends in our major markets and holiday season spending by consumers our home and entertainment segment is particularly subject to seasonality as its products are aimed at the consumer market and are in highest demand during the holiday shopping season historically approximately 40 to 50 of home and entertainment revenue has been generated in the second fiscal quarter we believe the seasonality of revenue is likely to continue in the future 

we intend to sustain the longterm growth of our businesses through technological innovation engineering excellence and a commitment to delivering highquality products and services to customers and partners recognizing that one of our primary challenges is to help accelerate worldwide pc adoption and software upgrades we continue to advance the functionality security and value of windows operating systems including versions for new devices such as tablet pcs media center pcs portable media centers and mobile devices such as smartphones we are also increasing our focus on emerging markets and reducing the amount of unlicensed software in those markets in addition we develop innovative software applications and solutions to enhance the productivity of information workers improve communication and collaboration in work groups aid business intelligence and streamline processes for small and midsized businesses to sustain the growth of our server and tools business amid competition from other vendors of both proprietary and open source software our goal is to deliver products that provide the best platform for network computing – the most advanced easiest to deploy and manage and most secure – with the lowest total cost of ownership 

to take advantage of new market opportunities we continue to invest in research and development of existing and new lines of business such as services for consumers businesses and large enterprises that we believe can contribute significantly to our longterm growth we also research and develop advanced technologies for future software products delivering breakthrough innovation and highvalue solutions through our integrated platform is the key to meeting customer needs and to our future growth 

we believe that over the last few years we have laid a foundation for longterm growth by delivering innovative new products creating opportunity for partners improving customer satisfaction with key audiences putting some of our most significant legal cases behind us and improving our internal business processes our focus in fiscal year 2006 is building on this foundation and executing well in key areas including continuing to innovate on our integrated software platform delivering compelling value propositions to customers responding effectively to customer and partner needs and continuing to focus internally on product excellence business efficacy and accountability across the company 

key market opportunities include

item 7 

  

worldwide macroeconomic factors have a strong correlation to business and consumer demand for our software services games and internet service offerings we expect that general macroeconomic trends will remain stable or experience slight improvement in fiscal year 2006 as compared to fiscal year 2005 our optimism is balanced by recent data which revealed slight downward revisions when compared to previous forecasts for gross domestic product growth in the us united kingdom france germany japan and latin america the leading indicators were also revised slightly lower for the major markets additionally recent surveys of chief information officers also reflect slight downward revisions in expected corporate it spend budgets and shortterm purchase intent 

as open source software development and distribution evolves we continue to seek to differentiate our products from competitive products based on open source software we believe that microsoft’s share of server unit operating systems held steady in fiscal year 2005 while linux distributions rose slightly faster on an absolute basis 

  

summary 

  

   

our revenue growth for fiscal year 2005 was driven by growth in licensing of windows server ™ operating systems and other server applications licensing of windows ® client operating systems through oems and increased licensing of office and other information worker products the license revenue growth resulted from growth in server hardware and pc shipments fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and overall improvements in it spending the november 2004 launch of the “halo 2 ® ” xbox game also contributed to the overall revenue growth for the company based on our preliminary estimates worldwide pc shipments from all sources grew about 11 to 13 and total server hardware shipments grew approximately 13 to 14 during fiscal year 2005 as compared to fiscal year 2004 the net impact of foreign exchange rates on revenue was positive in 2005 primarily due to relative strengthening of most foreign currencies particularly the euro and japanese yen against the us dollar had the exchange rates from the previous year been in effect in fiscal year 2005 translated international revenue growth earned in local currencies would have been approximately 873 million or two percentage points lower for fiscal year 2005 we hedge a portion of our international currency exposures thereby reducing our overall exposure fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have a greater impact on nonoem commercial and retail license business as a significant portion of those product revenues are denominated in foreign currencies the vast majority of oem license revenue is denominated in us dollars partially offsetting revenue growth rates was a 11 billion decline in earned revenue from upgrade advantage in fiscal year 2005 the upgrade advantage contract value reached its expiration dates in the first quarter of fiscal year 2005 this revenue was recognized over fiscal year 2003 and fiscal year 2004 and in the first quarter of fiscal year 2005 when the contract period expired 

revenue growth in fiscal year 2004 was primarily driven by the growth in licensing of windows client operating systems through oems windows server operating systems office and other server applications as a result of growth in pc and server hardware shipments the worldwide pc shipment growth rate from all sources was estimated at 13 and the windows server shipment was estimated at 18 in fiscal year 2004 as compared to fiscal year 2003 the net impact of foreign exchange rates on revenue was positive in fiscal year 2004 due to a relative strengthening of most foreign currencies versus the us dollar this resulted in approximately 110 billion growth in total revenue revenue growth in fiscal year 2003 was driven primarily by multiyear licensing that occurred before the licensing 60 transition date in the first quarter of fiscal year 2003 the fiscal year 2003 revenue growth also reflected a 933 million or 13 increase associated with oem licensing of windows operating systems and a 309 million or 23 increase in revenue from xbox video game consoles 

for fiscal year 2005 the operating income increase was driven by a decline in stockbased compensation expense increased revenue in server and tools client and information worker which have higher gross margins as compared to other segments and a reduction in legal costs associated with major litigation in addition strong sales of halo 2 reduced the overall operating loss for the home and entertainment segment for fiscal year 2005 the 329 billion decrease in stockbased compensation expense was partially offset by increased operating expenses of 562 million related to increased salary and benefits for new and existing headcount general and administrative expenses related to major litigation declined in fiscal year 2005 due to the 253 billion of charges related to the

item 7 

  

  

settlement of sun microsystems litigation and the fine imposed by the european commission in fiscal year 2004 this effect was partially offset by legal expenses of 208 billion related to settlements with ibm novell gateway and enduser class action plaintiffs to resolve antitrust issues and other matters in fiscal year 2004 the operating income decline was caused primarily by 253 billion of legal charges and 221 billion of stockbased compensation expense related to our employee stock option transfer program mainly offset by an increase in revenue in fiscal year 2003 the growth in operating income reflected an increase in revenue partially offset by an increase in operating expenses related to employee and related costs associated with headcount and increased legal settlement expenses primarily the time warner settlement charge of 750 million 

in fiscal year 2004 we implemented changes in employee compensation whereby employees are granted stock awards rather than stock options we also completed an employee stock option transfer program in the second quarter of fiscal year 2004 in which employees could elect to transfer all of their vested and unvested stock options with a strike price of 33 or higher to jpmorgan the unvested options that were transferred to jpmorgan became vested upon the transfer a total of 345 million of the 621 million eligible options were transferred which resulted in additional stockbased compensation expense of 221 billion in the second quarter of fiscal year 2004 as a result of these changes we expect stockbased compensation expense to continue to decrease for at least the next three fiscal years 

the following table shows total stockbased compensation expense by segment and by income statement classification for fiscal years 2003 2004 and 2005 

  

   

in fiscal year 2006 we expect revenue to grow at a higher rate than fiscal year 2005 mainly due to the launches of new products we expect higher revenue growth in fiscal year 2006 as compared to fiscal year 2005 in home and entertainment primarily driven by the launch of xbox 360 we estimate worldwide pc shipments will grow between 7 to 9 and worldwide server unit shipments will grow between 11 to 13 in fiscal year 2006 as compared to fiscal year 2005 we do not expect a benefit from yearoveryear foreign currency exchange rates in fiscal year 2006 

we expect our operating income growth rate in fiscal year 2006 to exceed our revenue growth rate operating income is expected to reflect lower operating expenses due to lower costs for legal settlements than incurred in fiscal year 2005 and a reduction in stockbased compensation expense the operating loss for home and entertainment is expected to increase in fiscal year 2006 driven by the launch of and investments in xbox 360

client 

  

   

client includes revenue from windows xp professional and home media center edition tablet pc edition and other standard windows operating systems client revenue growth is correlated with the growth of corporate and consumer purchases of pcs from oems that preinstall versions of windows operating systems because the oem channel accounts for over 80 of total client revenue the operating results for all periods presented have been restated to reflect the reorganization of the windows security group from server and tools to client 

client revenue increased in fiscal year 2005 driven by 12 growth in oem license units and 886 million or 10 growth in oem revenue from increased pc unit shipments partially offset by a 198 million or 9 decrease in revenue from commercial and retail licensing of windows operating systems this channelmix shift reflects our customers’ continued preference for upgrading their pc operating systems through the oem channel when they replace their pcs versus the purchase of a multiyear licensing agreement the mix of oem windows operating systems licensed with premium edition operating systems as a percentage of total oem windows operating systems licensed during the year remained flat at 50 of total oem windows operating systems as compared to the previous year revenue earned from upgrade advantage declined by 99 million in fiscal year 2005 contributing to the decrease in commercial and retail licensing revenue the differences between unit growth rates and revenue growth rates from year to year are affected by the mix of premium versions of operating systems licensed during the year changes in the geographical mix the channel mix of products sold by large multinational oems versus those sold by local and regional system builders and previous changes to deferral rates and product lives for undelivered elements of unearned revenue client revenue increase in fiscal year 2004 was driven by 14 growth in oem licenses and 16 growth in oem revenue on increased consumer pc unit shipments in the first half of the fiscal year and growth in business pc unit shipments in the second half of fiscal year 2004 

client operating income increased in fiscal year 2005 primarily due to an increase in oem revenue and a decrease in stockbased compensation expense these factors were partially offset by an increase in sales and marketing expenses associated with “start something” a globally launched advertising campaign marketing for security initiatives and an increase in salary and benefits for new and existing headcount the additional headcount for research and development was primarily devoted to the continued development of the windows client nextgeneration operating system the operating income for fiscal year 2004 has been restated for a reclassification of legal settlement charges totaling 700 million from client to corporate expenses to conform to the current year presentation client operating income increased for fiscal year 2004 compared to fiscal year 2003 mainly due to growth in revenue partially offset by increased operating expenses primarily related to stockbased compensation expense from the employee stock option transfer program in the second quarter of fiscal year 2004 

we anticipate that worldwide pc shipments will grow at approximately 7 to 9 in fiscal year 2006 continuing to influence our growth in client revenue in addition we estimate that increasing shipments of laptops as a percentage of total pc systems will continue to positively influence client revenue growth due to shorter replacement cycles for laptops the time between operating system releases may affect our ability to close some multiyear licensing agreements we expect growth rates in emerging markets to continue to outpace mature market growth rates piracy continues to be a challenge in both emerging and mature markets we intend to focus on growing oem licenses faster than the overall market by reducing piracy particularly in the mature markets through initiatives such as windows genuine advantage client commercial and retail licensing revenues are expected to continue to lag behind overall client revenue growth but we expect to see improvements in these channels in fiscal year 2006 compared to fiscal year 2005 we anticipate a modest increase in our premium product mix in fiscal year 2006 although we

anticipate shipments of the premiumpriced media center edition will grow as a percentage of the total operating system shipments major investments in fiscal year 2006 will focus on development of windows vista the nextgeneration pc operating system and will include marketing initiatives such as the global “start something” campaign 

  

server and tools 

  

   

server and tools consists of server software licenses and client access licenses cals for windows server microsoft sql server ®  exchange server and other server products it also includes developer tools training certification microsoft press premier and professional product support services and microsoft consulting services server and tools concentrates on licensing products applications tools content and services that make information technology professionals and developers more productive and efficient the segment uses multiple channels for licensing including preinstalled oem versions licenses through partners and licenses directly to end customers the licenses are sold both as onetime licenses and as multiyear volume licenses depending upon the needs of different customers server and tools uses product innovation and partnerships with information technology professionals to drive the adoption and sales growth of its products server and tools growth is driven by performance of the overall market for information technology – both hardware and software the operating results for previous years have been restated for the reorganization of the windows security group from server and tools to client and the reorganization of professional product support services from information worker to server and tools 

server and tools revenue growth in fiscal year 2005 was mainly driven by growth in server and server application revenue including cal revenue which grew 11 billion or 17 in fiscal year 2005 reflecting broad adoption of windows server system ™ products including windows server sql server exchange server and management servers we estimate that overall server hardware shipments grew 13 to 14 during fiscal year 2005 and that windowsbased server shipments grew at a comparable rate for the same period consulting and premier and professional product support services revenue increased 241 million or 19 compared to the previous year primarily due to increased consultant utilization and new premier customers foreign currency exchange rate changes accounted for approximately 284 million or three percentage points of total server and tools revenue growth which was offset by a 314 million decline in upgrade advantage revenue earned in fiscal year 2004 server and server applications revenue including cal revenue grew 128 billion or 25 foreign currency exchange rates contributed approximately 350 million or five percentage points of server and tools revenue growth in fiscal year 2004 compared to fiscal year 2003 consulting and premier product support services revenue increased 192 million or 18 compared to fiscal year 2003 due to increased customer penetration from new product offerings 

server and tools operating income growth for fiscal year 2005 was primarily due to an increase in revenue and a decrease in stockbased compensation expense this was partially offset by an increase in sales and marketing costs and headcountrelated costs from increased hiring and increases in salary and benefits operating income for the previous year has been restated for a reclassification of 122 billion of legal settlements from server and tools to corporate expenses to conform to the current year presentation server and tools operating income for fiscal year 2004 increased slightly due to the revenue increase offset by increased stockbased compensation charges including 651 million related to the employee stock option transfer program in the second quarter of fiscal year 2004 

we expect worldwide server hardware shipments to grow 11 to 13 in fiscal year 2006 however we face strong competition from linuxbased unix and other server operating systems we anticipate little or no yearoveryear foreign currency exchange rate impacts in fiscal year 2006 we also expect server and tools operating expenses to increase during fiscal year 2006 due to expected investment in headcount and new marketing initiatives and upcoming product releases including sql server 2005 and visual studio 2005

information worker 

  

   

information worker consists of the microsoft office system of programs servers services and solutions designed to increase personal team and organization productivity information worker includes microsoft office microsoft project microsoft visio ®  sharepoint ® portal server cals and other information worker products including microsoft livemeeting ® and onenote ®  most revenue from this segment comes from licensing our office system products revenue growth depends on the ability to add value to the core office product set and expand our product offerings in other information worker areas such as document lifecycle management collaboration and business intelligence beginning in fiscal year 2005 the small and midmarket solutions  partners smsp organization which was historically part of information worker was realigned in microsoft business solutions as a result of this change information worker results have been restated to reflect the reclassification of the smsp organization to microsoft business solutions the results for previous periods have also been restated due to the reclassification of professional product support services from information worker into server and tools 

information worker revenue increased in fiscal year 2005 primarily due to a 3 or 269 million increase in volume licensing retail packaged product and preinstalled versions of office in japan a 6 or 91 million increase in oem revenue and the impact of foreign currency exchange rates partially offset by reduced upgrade advantage earned revenue changes in foreign currency exchange rates accounted for approximately 367 million or three percentage points of the revenue growth for fiscal year 2005 as compared to the previous fiscal year offset by a 663 million decline in upgrade advantage earned revenue revenue growth for fiscal year 2004 from volume licensing retail packaged product and preinstalled versions of office in japan was 15 in aggregate this increase was driven by recognition of unearned revenue primarily from a large increase in multiyear licenses signed previous to the transition to our licensing 60 programs and approximately 110 million related to the launch of office 2003 oem licensing revenue grew 29 or 325 million foreign currency exchange rates provided approximately 485 million or 5 of total information worker revenue growth 

information worker operating income growth for fiscal year 2005 was primarily due to the revenue growth and a decrease in stockbased compensation expense operating expenses were also impacted by a reduction in marketing campaign costs from the previous period associated with the launch of office 2003 this decline was offset by an increase in headcountrelated costs from increased hiring and increases in salary and benefits information worker operating income in fiscal year 2004 increased from the previous year primarily due to growth in revenue partially offset by an increase in operating expenses primarily related to 351 million of stockbased compensation expense from the employee stock option transfer program in the second quarter of fiscal year 2004 and higher sales and marketing expenses 

the revenue growth rate for information worker is expected to be higher in fiscal year 2006 than fiscal year 2005 we expect sustained momentum in our oem and multiyear licensing offerings and increased purchasing of office system 2003 as enterprises complete their product evaluations we expect to see slowing revenue from packaged product late in the year as we approach the next version launch we anticipate little or no yearoveryear foreign currency exchange rate benefit in fiscal year 2006

the increase in microsoft business solutions revenue in fiscal year 2005 was mainly due to a 10 revenue growth in software partially offset by a 25 decline in services revenue which resulted from encouraging our partners to provide more of these types of services the software revenue increase was driven by a 9 growth in license revenue and 16 growth in enhancement revenue as compared to the previous year and is attributed to growth in our line of business solutions and customer relationship management solutions and increased microsoft partner program subscriptions the revenue increase in fiscal year 2004 was primarily attributable to continued growth in licensing of navision and axapta line of business solutions new sales of microsoft crm and microsoft partner program subscriptions 

microsoft business solutions operating loss declined in fiscal year 2005 primarily due to a decline in stockbased compensation expense an increase in product revenue and a decline in acquisition intangibles amortization the reduction in operating loss was partially offset by a net increase in sales and marketing expense driven by incremental headcount and marketing costs in the smsp organization in addition there has been an increase in marketing and product development investments in our portfolio of business solutions the operating loss for fiscal year 2004 increased from fiscal year 2003 due to an increase in stockbased compensation expense from the employee stock option transfer program in the second quarter of fiscal year 2004 partially offset by an increase in revenue and lower operating expenses including 42 million of lower intangibles amortization costs 

microsoft business solutions expects continued revenue growth through its portfolio of business solutions and related product releases including newer applications such as microsoft office small business accounting and microsoft crm continued investment in the next generation of solutions broader geographical coverage and plans for facilitating our partners to provide customized vertical solutions should result in improved business performance for microsoft business solutions in fiscal year 2006

advertising program and the impact of the home page redesign revenue from subscription and transaction services other than internet access increased 84 million or 88 in fiscal year 2005 as a result of growth in the number of msn premium subscribers through our carrier partnerships offsetting the overall revenue growth was a decline of 219 million or 24 in internet access revenue driven by the continued migration of internet access subscribers to broadband or other competitively priced internet service providers at the end of the current fiscal year msn had 27 million internet access subscribers and 91 million total subscribers compared to 43 million and 88 million at the end of the previous year in addition msn has over 420 million unique users monthly over 205 million active hotmail accounts and over 175 million active messenger accounts in fiscal year 2004 msn advertising revenue increased 360 million or 43 as a result of growth in paid search and growth in the overall internet advertising market this increase was partially offset by a decline of 168 million or 15 in internet access revenue revenue from subscription and transaction services other than internet access increased 71 million 

in fiscal year 2005 msn operating income increased mainly due to a decrease in stockbased compensation expense reduced online operations and bandwidth costs associated with the internet access business as the number of subscribers declines and increased advertising and subscription revenue the operating income increase was partially offset by an increase in headcountrelated costs from increased hiring and increases in salary and benefits and a 48 million tax benefit recorded in the first quarter of fiscal year 2004 msn reached profitability in the first quarter of fiscal year 2004 and was profitable for fiscal year 2004 the improvement in profitability in fiscal year 2004 was primarily driven by an increase in revenue a decline in customer acquisition costs and other expenses related to the internet access business efficiency gains in the operations of the advertising and subscription businesses and a 48 million refund of previous year taxes partially offset by an increase in stockbased compensation expense 

msn expects increased growth in advertising revenue as it benefits from improvements to its advertising platform and search engine and continued increases in internet spending we expect revenue from narrowband internet access to continue to decline in fiscal year 2006 profitability may decline in fiscal year 2006 as investments are made in the development of new applications and services the search and search monetization platform and growth in the field sales force msn may from time to time continue to make investments in improving the user experience and in some cases the number of advertisements delivered either via our search tools or via our internet portals may be reduced to improve the overall user experience thereby helping to sustain and grow our user base effective july 1 2005 functions related to mappoint in mobile and embedded devices have been moved to msn this reorganization will result in a corresponding change to the mobile and embedded devices and msn reported results 

  

mobile and embedded devices 

  

   

mobile and embedded devices includes windows mobile ™ software windows embedded operating systems mappoint ®  and windows automotive these products extend the advantages of the windows platform to mobile devices such as pdas phones and a wide range of embedded devices the business is also responsible for managing sales and customer relationships for microsoft overall with device manufacturers and communication sector customers the communication sector includes network service providers such as wireless wireline and cable operators and media and entertainment companies the market for products in these segments is intensely competitive competitive alternatives vary based on product lines and include product offerings from commercial and noncommercial mobile operating system providers and proprietary software developed by oems and mobile operators short product lifecycles in product lines such as windows mobile software may impact our continuing revenue streams 

mobile and embedded devices revenue growth for fiscal year 2005 was primarily due to unit volume increases in all major product lines especially windows mobile software sales and windows embedded operating systems increased revenue for windows mobile software was primarily driven by increased market demand for connected mobile devices such as phoneenabled pdas and smartphones and strong growth in volume shipments for

investment income 

  

the components of investment income and other in each full fiscal year are as follows 

  

   

dividends and interest income declined 432 million in fiscal year 2005 due to the combination of a greater allocation of funds to lower yielding more liquid asset classes in preparation for the 3264 billion special dividend paid on december 2 2004 and a lower portfolio balance following payment of the special dividend 

net gains on investments declined 707 million in fiscal year 2005 due primarily to greater sales of investments in the previous fiscal year in preparation for the special dividend paid on december 2 2004 net gains on investments also include otherthantemporary impairments of 152 million in fiscal year 2005 compared to 82 million fiscal year 2004 investments are considered to be impaired when a decline in fair value is judged to be other than temporary we employ a systematic methodology that considers available evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments if the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value we evaluate among other factors general market conditions the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost and our intent and ability to hold the investment we also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the investee including industry and sector performance changes in technology operational and financing cash flow factors and rating agency actions once a decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary an impairment charge is recorded and a new cost basis in the investment is established 

derivative instruments are used to manage exposures to interest rates equity prices and foreign currency exchange rates and to facilitate portfolio diversification net derivative losses in fiscal year 2005 were primarily related to losses on equity derivatives interest rate derivatives and foreign currency contracts during fiscal year 2005 losses related to equity derivatives used to economically hedge against a decline in equity prices were 202 million and losses related to interest rate derivatives were 53 million these losses were offset by the combination of realized gains on sales of securities and unrealized gains related to increases in the market value of the underlying assets included as a component of other comprehensive income net losses related to foreign currency contracts were 53 million related in part to hedging anticipated foreign currency revenues while the us dollar generally declined against most currencies during the current fiscal year and economically hedging foreign currency based investment exposures losses related to hedging foreign currencybased investment exposures were offset by unrealized gains in the underlying assets net gains on derivatives also included gains related to commodity positions used to provide portfolio diversification gains on commodity positions were 46 million during fiscal year 2005 

in fiscal year 2004 dividends and interest income decreased by 65 million mainly due to lower dividend income resulting from the exchange of att 5 convertible preferred debt for common shares of comcast during fiscal year 2003 and declining interest rates partly offset by a larger investment portfolio net gains on investments include

otherthantemporary impairments of 82 million in fiscal year 2004 compared to 115 billion in fiscal year 2003 and higher net realized gains on sales in fiscal year 2004 as we moved to more liquid investment asset classes net realized gains on sales were 165 billion in fiscal year 2004 and 119 billion in fiscal year 2003 the decline in impairments was due to improved market conditions derivative losses decreased 156 million to 268 million in fiscal year 2004 compared to fiscal year 2003 primarily due to the combined effects of interest rate movements on interest rate sensitive instruments and equity market price movements relative to positions used to hedge the fair value of certain equity securities 

net losses on equity investees and other for the previous periods were reclassified into investment income and other to conform to the current period presentation 

  

income taxes 

  

our effective tax rate for the full fiscal year 2005 was 26 compared with 33 for fiscal year 2004 the decreased rate for the full year resulted primarily from the reversal of 776 million of previously accrued taxes upon settling an internal revenue service examination for fiscal years 1997 to 1999 and recording a tax benefit of 179 million generated by the decision to repatriate foreign subsidiary earnings under a temporary incentive provided by the american jobs creation act of 2004 the effective tax rate for fiscal year 2003 was 32 the fiscal year 2003 rate reflected a benefit in the second quarter of 126 million which resulted from the reversal of previously accrued taxes that were related to a previous unfavorable tax court ruling portions of which were reversed in 2003 by the ninth circuit court of appeals 

  

financial condition 

  

cash and shortterm investments totaled 3775 billion as of june 30 2005 compared to 6059 billion as of june 30 2004 the decline is primarily attributable to the special dividend of 300 per share or 3264 billion paid on december 2 2004 and to common stock repurchases of 312 million shares for 80 billion during 2005 equity and other investments were 1100 billion as of june 30 2005 compared to 1221 billion as of june 30 2004 the investment portfolio consists primarily of fixedincome securities diversified among industries and individual issuers our investments are generally liquid and investment grade the portfolio is invested predominantly in us dollar denominated securities but also includes foreign currency denominated positions in order to diversify financial risk the portfolio is primarily invested in shortterm securities to facilitate rapid deployment for immediate cash needs as a result of the special dividend and shares repurchased our retained deficit including accumulated other comprehensive income was 1230 billion at june 30 2005 our retained deficit is not expected to impact our future ability to operate or pay dividends given our continuing profitability and strong cash and financial position 

  

unearned revenue 

  

unearned revenue is attributable to volume licensing programs undelivered elements of software licensing arrangements and certain other services unearned revenue from volume licensing programs represents customer billings paid either upfront or at the beginning of each billing coverage period that are accounted for as subscriptions with revenue recognized ratably over the billing coverage period for certain other licensing arrangements revenue attributable to undelivered elements including free postdelivery telephone support and the right to receive unspecified upgradesenhancements of microsoft internet explorer on a whenandifavailable basis is based on the sales price of those elements when sold separately and is recognized ratably on a straightline basis over the related product’s life cycle other unearned revenue includes services tv platform microsoft business solutions and advertising and subscription services where we have been paid upfront and earn the revenue when we provide the service or software or otherwise meet the revenue recognition criteria 

unearned revenue as of june 30 2005 increased 990 million from june 30 2004 reflecting current period billings outpacing the recognition of deferrals from multiyear licensing arrangements by 925 million and a 304 million increase primarily in unearned revenue for services msn advertising and subscriptions xbox live tv platform and microsoft business solutions partially offset by a 239 million decline in revenue deferred for undelivered elements

the following table outlines the expected recognition of unearned revenue at june 30 2005 

  

   

cash flows 

  

cash flow from operations for fiscal year 2005 increased 14 to 1661 billion due primarily to an increase in cash receipts from customers driven by our 8 revenue growth combined with a 12 increase in unearned revenue cash payments in fiscal year 2005 resulting from significant legal settlements were approximately 18 billion lower than in the previous year adding to the overall increase in operating cash flow partially offsetting these factors were increased payments to employees resulting from a 7 increase in fulltime employees cash used for financing was 4108 billion in fiscal year 2005 driven by 3611 billion of cash dividends paid in fiscal year 2005 compared to 173 billion paid in fiscal year 2004 the increase was also partially driven by 80 billion in cash used for common stock repurchases an increase of 467 billion in cash used for share repurchases compared to the previous year reflecting 312 million shares repurchased in fiscal year 2005 an increase of 1885 million shares compared to the previous year net cash from investing was 1503 billion in fiscal year 2005 an increase of 1837 billion from fiscal year 2004 primarily due to a 2359 billion increase in investment maturities that occurred to fund cash dividends paid in fiscal year 2005 partially offset by a 532 billion decrease in cash from combined investment purchase and sale activity 

cash flow from operations for fiscal year 2004 decreased 117 billion to 1463 billion the decrease primarily reflects the combined cash outflows of 256 billion related to the sun microsystems settlement and the european commission fine partially offset by increased cash receipts from customers driven by the rise in revenue billings cash used for financing was 236 billion in fiscal year 2004 a decrease of 286 billion from the previous year the decrease reflects that we did not repurchase common stock in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2004 combined with a 628 million increase primarily from stock issuances related to employee stock options exercises partially offset by an 872 million increase in cash dividends paid we repurchased 1237 million shares of common stock under our share repurchase program in fiscal year 2004 cash used for investing was 334 billion in fiscal year 2004 a decrease of 388 billion from fiscal year 2003 

cash flow from operations was 1580 billion for fiscal year 2003 an increase of 129 billion from fiscal year 2002 the increase primarily reflects the rise in cash receipts from customers driven by the increase in revenue billings and maintenance of relatively stable accounts receivable levels cash used for financing was 522 billion in fiscal year 2003 an increase of 651 million from the previous year the increase reflects a cash dividend payment of 857 million in 2003 and an increase of 417 million in common stock repurchased offsetting 623 million received from common stock issued we repurchased 2382 million shares of common stock under our share repurchase program in fiscal year 2003 cash used for investing was 750 billion in fiscal year 2003 a decrease of 337 billion from fiscal year 2002 due to stronger portfolio performance on sold and matured investments 

we have no material longterm debt stockholders’ equity at june 30 2005 was 4812 billion we will continue to invest in sales marketing product support infrastructure and existing and advanced areas of technology additions to property and equipment will continue including new facilities and computer systems for research and development sales and marketing support and administrative staff commitments for constructing new buildings were 152 million on june 30 2005 we have operating leases for most us and international sales and support offices and certain equipment under which we incurred rental expense totaling 290 million 331 million and 299 million in fiscal year 2003 2004 and 2005 respectively we have issued residual value guarantees in connection with various operating leases these guarantees provide that if we do not purchase the leased property from the

lessor at the end of the lease term then we are liable to the lessor for an amount equal to the shortage if any between the proceeds from the sale of the property and an agreed value as of june 30 2005 the maximum amount of the residual value guarantees was approximately 271 million we believe that proceeds from the sale of properties under operating leases would exceed the payment obligation and therefore no liability currently exists we have not engaged in any related party transactions or arrangements with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect liquidity or the availability of requirements for capital resources 

in fiscal year 2005 our board of directors approved 340 per share cash dividends with 332 paid as of june 30 2005 a quarterly dividend of 008 per share or approximately 857 million was approved by our board of directors on june 15 2005 to be paid to shareholders of record as of august 17 2005 on september 8 2005 

on july 20 2004 our board of directors approved a plan to buy back up to 30 billion in microsoft common stock over four years the specific timing and amount of repurchases will vary based on market conditions securities law limitations and other factors the repurchases will be made using our cash resources the repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time without previous notice in any period cash used in financing activities related to common stock repurchased may differ from the comparable change in stockholders’ equity reflecting timing differences between the recognition of share repurchase transactions and their settlement for cash during fiscal year 2005 we repurchased 312 million shares or 80 billion of our common stock under this plan 

we believe existing cash and shortterm investments together with funds generated from operations should be sufficient to meet operating requirements quarterly dividends and planned share repurchases our philosophy regarding the maintenance of a balance sheet with a large component of cash and shortterm investments and equity and other investments reflects our views on potential future capital requirements relating to research and development creation and expansion of sales distribution channels investments and acquisitions share dilution management legal risks and challenges to our business model we regularly assess our investment management approach in view of our current and potential future needs

recently issued accounting standards 

  

in november 2004 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 151 inventory costs  which clarifies the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense freight handling costs and wasted material sfas no 151 will be effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june 15 2005 we do not believe the adoption of sfas no 151 will have a material impact on our financial statements 

in december 2004 the fasb issued sfas no 153 exchanges of nonmonetary assets  which eliminates the exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance sfas no 153 will be effective for nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after june 15 2005 we do not believe the adoption of sfas no 153 will have a material impact on our financial statements 

in december 2004 the fasb issued sfas no 123r sharebased payment  which establishes standards for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services this standard requires an issuer to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grantdate fair value of the award this eliminates the exception to account for such awards using the intrinsic method previously allowable under accounting principles board apb opinion no 25 in march 2005 the sec released staff accounting bulletin sab 107 sharebased payment which expresses views of the sec staff about the application of sfas no 123r in april 2005 the sec issued a rule that sfas no 123r will be effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after june 15 2005 we previously adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 123 accounting for stockbased compensation  on july 1 2003 and restated previous periods at that time for all awards granted to employees after july 1 1995 accordingly we believe sfas no 123r will not have a material impact on our financial statements however we continue to assess the potential impact that the adoption of sfas no 123r will have on the classification of tax deductions for stockbased compensation in our statements of cash flows 

  

application of critical accounting policies 

  

our financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with us gaap preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses these estimates and assumptions are affected by management’s application of accounting policies critical accounting policies for us include revenue recognition impairment of investment securities impairment of goodwill accounting for research and development costs accounting for legal contingencies accounting for income taxes and accounting for stockbased compensation 

we account for the licensing of software in accordance with american institute of certified public accountants aicpa statement of position sop 972 software revenue recognition the application of sop 972 requires judgment including whether a software arrangement includes multiple elements and if so whether vendorspecific objective evidence vsoe of fair value exists for those elements customers receive certain elements of our products over a period of time these elements include free postdelivery telephone support and the right to receive unspecified upgradesenhancements of microsoft internet explorer on a whenandifavailable basis the fair value of which is recognized over the product’s estimated life cycle changes to the elements in a software arrangement the

item 7 

  

  

ability to identify vsoe for those elements the fair value of the respective elements and changes to a product’s estimated life cycle could materially impact the amount of earned and unearned revenue judgment is also required to assess whether future releases of certain software represent new products or upgrades and enhancements to existing products 

sfas no 115 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  and sec sab 59 accounting for noncurrent marketable equity securities  provide guidance on determining when an investment is otherthantemporarily impaired investments are reviewed quarterly for indicators of otherthantemporary impairment this determination requires significant judgment in making this judgment we employ a systematic methodology quarterly that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments if the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value we evaluate among other factors general market conditions the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost and our intent and ability to hold the investment we also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the investee including industry and sector performance changes in technology operational and financing cash flow factors and rating agency actions once a decline in fair value is determined to be otherthantemporary an impairment charge is recorded and a new cost basis in the investment is established if market industry andor investee conditions deteriorate we may incur future impairments 

sfas no 142 goodwill and other intangible assets  requires that goodwill be tested for impairment at the reporting unit level operating segment or one level below an operating segment on an annual basis july 1 for us and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value these events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate legal factors operating performance indicators competition sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment including the identification of reporting units assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units assignment of goodwill to reporting units and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit the fair value of each reporting unit is estimated using a discounted cash flow methodology this requires significant judgments including estimation of future cash flows which is dependent on internal forecasts estimation of the longterm rate of growth for our business the useful life over which cash flows will occur and determination of our weighted average cost of capital changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value andor goodwill impairment for each reporting unit 

we account for research and development costs in accordance with several accounting pronouncements including sfas no 2 accounting for research and development costs  and sfas no 86 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold leased or otherwise marketed  sfas no 86 specifies that costs incurred internally in researching and developing a computer software product should be charged to expense until technological feasibility has been established for the product once technological feasibility is established all software costs should be capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers judgment is required in determining when technological feasibility of a product is established we have determined that technological feasibility for our software products is reached shortly before the products are released to manufacturing costs incurred after technological feasibility is established are not material and accordingly we expense all research and development costs when incurred 

the outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought against us are subject to significant uncertainty sfas no 5 accounting for contingencies requires that an estimated loss from a loss contingency such as a legal proceeding or claim should be accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated disclosure of a contingency is required if there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss has been incurred in determining whether a loss should be accrued we evaluate among other factors the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss changes in these factors could materially impact our financial position or our results of operations 

sfas no 109 accounting for income taxes  establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for the effect of income taxes the objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity’s financial statements or tax returns judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our financial position results of operations or cash flows

item 7 7a 

  

we account for stockbased compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 123 accounting for stockbased compensation under the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 123 stockbased compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period determining the fair value of stockbased awards at the grant date requires judgment including estimating the expected term of stock options the expected volatility of our stock and expected dividends in addition judgment is also required in estimating the amount of stockbased awards that are expected to be forfeited if actual results differ significantly from these estimates stockbased compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially impacted 

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

we are exposed to foreign currency interest rate fixed income equity and commodity price risks a portion of these risks is hedged but fluctuations could impact our results of operations and financial position we hedge a portion of anticipated revenue and accounts receivable exposure to foreign currency fluctuations primarily with option contracts we monitor our foreign currency exposures daily to maximize the overall effectiveness of our foreign currency hedge positions principal currencies hedged include the euro japanese yen british pound and canadian dollar fixed income securities are subject to interest rate risk the portfolio is diversified and structured to minimize credit risk securities held in our equity and other investments portfolio are subject to price risk and are generally not hedged however we use options to hedge our price risk on certain equity securities that are held primarily for strategic purposes 

we use a valueatrisk var model to estimate and quantify our market risks var is the expected loss for a given confidence level in fair value of our portfolio due to adverse market movements over a defined time horizon the var model is not intended to represent actual losses in fair value but is used as a risk estimation and management tool the model used for currencies and equities is geometric brownian motion which allows incorporation of optionality with regard to these risk exposures for interest rate risk the mean reverting geometric brownian motion is used to reflect the principle that fixedincome securities prices revert to maturity value over time 

var is calculated by first simulating 10000 market price paths over a specified period of time for equities interest rates and foreign exchange rates taking into account historical correlations among the different rates and prices each resulting unique set of equities prices interest rates and foreign exchange rates is then applied to substantially all individual holdings to reprice each holding the 250th worst performance out of 10000 represents the var over a specified period of time at the 975 percentile confidence level several risk factors are not captured in the model including liquidity risk operational risk credit risk and legal risk 

certain securities in our equity portfolio are held for strategic purposes we hedge the value of a portion of these securities through the use of derivative contracts such as putcall collars in these arrangements we hedge a security’s equity price risk below the purchased put strike and forgo most or all of the benefits of the security’s appreciation above the sold call strike in exchange for the premium received for the sold call we also hold equity securities for general investment return purposes we have incurred material impairment charges related to these securities in previous periods the var amounts disclosed below are used as a risk management tool and reflect an estimate of potential reductions in fair value of our portfolio losses in fair value over the specified holding period can exceed the reported var by significant amounts and can also accumulate over a longer time horizon than the specified holding period used in the var analysis var amounts are not necessarily reflective of potential accounting losses including determinations of otherthantemporary losses in fair value in accordance with us gaap 

the var numbers are shown separately for interest rate currency equity and commodity risks these var numbers include the underlying portfolio positions and related hedges we use historical data to estimate var given the reliance on historical data var is most effective in estimating risk exposures in markets in which there are no fundamental changes or shifts in market conditions an inherent limitation in var is that the distribution of past changes in market risk factors may not produce accurate predictions of future market risk

management began using a 1day var for internal risk measurement purposes effective for the quarterended march 31 2005 the effect of changing from 20day var to 1day var was not material and there have been no modifications to the assumptions or parameters within the model the following table sets forth the 1day var for substantially all of our positions 

  

   

the total 1day var for the combined risk categories was 195 million at june 30 2005 and 187 million at june 30 2004 the total var is 39 less at june 30 2005 and 35 less at june 30 2004 than the sum of the separate risk categories for each of those years in the above table due to the diversification benefit of the combination of risks

historically approximately 40 percent of information worker billed revenue comes from multiyear license agreements with large enterprises revenues from these licenses generally depend upon the number of information workers in a licensed enterprise therefore our revenue from this category of agreements is relatively independent of the number of pcs sold in a given year but rather depends on the number of employees in a given enterprise

item 1 

  

consequently general employment levels particularly in north america and emea significantly affect information worker revenue approximately 40 percent of information worker revenue comes from new licenses acquired through fully packaged product and transactional volume licensing programs to individual consumers and enterprises of all sizes most of this revenue is sensitive to information technology budgets which often depend on general economic conditions the remaining approximately 20 percent of information worker revenue is from licenses to oems for new pcs and through sales of retail packaged products and is affected by the relative level of pc shipments

we license software to organizations under arrangements that allow the enduser customer to acquire multiple licenses of product these arrangements are designed to provide organizations with a means of acquiring multiple licenses without having to acquire separate packaged product through retail channels in delivering organizational licensing arrangements to the market we use different programs designed to provide flexibility for organizations of various sizes while these programs may differ in various parts of the world generally they are as follows 

  

open designed primarily for smalltomedium organizations 5 to over 250 licenses this program allows customers to acquire perpetual licenses and at the customer’s election rights to future versions of software products over a specified time period generally two years the offering that conveys rights to future versions of software product over the contract period is called software assurance software assurance also provides support tools and training to help customers deploy and use software efficiently under the open program customers can acquire licenses only or licenses with software assurance they can also renew software assurance upon the expiration of existing volume licensing agreements 

  

select designed primarily for mediumtolarge organizations greater than 250 licenses this program allows customers to acquire perpetual licenses and at the customer’s election software assurance which consists of rights to future versions of software products support tools and training over a specified time period generally three years similar to the open program customers can acquire licenses only acquire licenses with software assurance or renew software assurance upon the expiration of existing volume licensing agreements

competition 

  

the software business is intensely competitive and subject to rapid technological change evolving customer requirements and changing business models in every segment we face significant competition in all areas of our business the rapid pace of technological change continually creates new opportunities for existing competitors and startups and can quickly render existing technologies less valuable customer requirements and preferences continually change as other information technologies emerge or become less expensive and as concerns such as security and privacy become more important our direct competitors include firms adopting alternative business models to the commercial software model firms adopting the noncommercial software model typically provide customers with open source software at nominal cost and earn revenue on complementary services and products without having to bear the full costs of research and development for the open source software global software piracy – the unlawful copying and distribution of our copyrighted software products – deprives us of significant amounts of revenue on an annual basis future versions of our products compete with the existing versions licensed to our installed base of customers this means that future versions must deliver significant additional value in order to induce existing customers to purchase a new version of our product 

our competitive position may be adversely affected in the future by one or more of the factors described in this section or as yet undefined additional factors that may arise 

  

client although we are the leader in pc operating system software products we face strong competition from wellestablished companies and entities with differing approaches to the market competing commercial software products including variants of unix are supplied by competitors such as ibm hewlettpackard apple computer sun microsystems and others which are vertically integrated in both software development and hardware manufacturing and have developed operating systems that they preinstall on their own computers personal computer oems who preinstall thirdparty operating systems may also license these firms’ operating systems the linux operating system which is also derived from unix and is available without payment under a general public license has gained increasing acceptance as competitive pressures lead personal computer oems to reduce costs the microsoft windows operating systems also face competition from alternative platforms as well as innovative devices that may reduce consumer demand for traditional personal computers we believe our operating system products compete effectively by delivering better innovation an easytouse interface compatibility with a broad range of hardware and software applications and the largest support network for any operating system 

  

server and tools our server operating system products face intense competition from a wide variety of competing server operating systems and server applications offered by firms with a variety of market approaches vertically integrated computer manufacturers such as ibm hewlettpackard sun microsystems and others offer their own variant of unix preinstalled on server hardware and nearly all computer manufacturers offer server hardware for the linux operating system ibm’s endorsement of linux has accelerated its acceptance as an alternative to both traditional unix and windows server operating systems linux’s competitive position has also benefited from the large number of compatible applications now produced by many leading commercial software developers as well as noncommercial software developers a number of companies supply versions of linux including novell and red hat 

we compete in the business of providing enterprisewide computing solutions with several companies that provide competing solutions as well as middleware technology platforms ibm and sun microsystems lead a group of companies focused on the java 2 platform enterprise edition j2ee commercial software developers that provide competing server applications for the pcbased distributed clientserver environments include oracle ibm and computer associates there are also a number of noncommercial software server applications available

information worker while we are the leader in business productivity software applications for personal computers competitors to the microsoft office system include many software application vendors such as apple corel ibm oracle sun microsystems and local application developers in europe and asia ibm and corel have significant installed bases with their office productivity products and both have aggressive pricing strategies also apple and ibm preinstall certain of their application software products on various models of their pcs competing directly with our applications corel’s suite and sun microsystems’ star office are aggressively priced and attractive for oems to preinstall on lowpriced pcs the openofficeorg project provides a freely downloadable crossplatform application that is gaining popularity in certain market segments in addition to traditional clientside applications webbased offerings such as simdesk provide an alternative to microsoft office system products in addition ibm has a significant installed base of messaging and collaboration software we believe that our products compete effectively by providing customers significant benefits such as ease of use personal productivity support for effective teaming and collaboration and better information management and control and by providing many customers a lower total cost of ownership than alternatives 

  

microsoft business solutions the small and midmarket business applications segment is highly fragmented and is intensely competitive in all sectors where we compete we face competition from a large number of companies in this business wellknown vendors focused on small and midmarket business solutions such as intuit and sage along with many others compete against us for a portion of this segment in addition largeenterprise focused vendors such as oracle peoplesoft and sap are repositioning some of their business applications to focus on small and mediumsized business and thus also compete against us for a portion of this segment in addition there are thousands of other vendors in specific localities or industries that offer their own enterprise resource planning erp customer relationship management crm andor analytic solutions we believe that our business applications products across financial management supply chain management and crm compete effectively in our target segments by offering solutions and services that address multiple segment needs across industries through consistent innovation in product functionality delivered through a growing network of partners 

  

msn msn competes with yahoo google aol earthlink us cable and dsl providers and a vast array of web sites and portals that offer content and online services of all types msn also competes with traditional advertising and print media as the broadband access market grows we expect to have increasing opportunities to deliver rich and compelling services and experiences for consumers msn’s advertising revenue has grown considerably over the last year and we expect this trend to continue in display advertising as well as in searchbased advertising as online advertising continues to gain market acceptance this growth has led to competitors aggressively pursuing both advertisers and consumers with expanded offerings and new technology we are building our own algorithmic search engine and investing to support the continued growth of our advertising business due to the continuing trend of consumers migrating from narrowband to broadband internet access we expect our narrowband internet access subscriber base to decline we believe our competitive advantage comes from our ability to empower people globally through information software and services that help them find discover and experience what they want online

management’s discussion and analysis mda contains statements that are forwardlooking these statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties actual results could differ materially because of factors discussed in “issues and uncertainties” and elsewhere in this report 

  

overview 

  

the following management’s discussion and analysis “mda” is intended to help the reader understand microsoft corporation mda is provided as a supplement to and should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the accompanying notes “notes” 

we generate revenues income and cash flows by developing manufacturing licensing and supporting a wide range of software products for many computing devices our software products include operating systems for servers personal computers pcs and intelligent devices server applications for distributed computing environments information worker productivity applications business solutions applications and software development tools we provide consulting and product support services and we train and certify system integrators and developers we sell the xbox video game console and games pc games and peripherals online communication services and information services are delivered through our msn portals and channels around the world 

we also research and develop advanced technologies for future software products delivering breakthrough innovation and highvalue solutions through our integrated platform are the key to meeting customer needs and to our future growth 

we believe that over the last few years we have laid a foundation for longterm growth delivering innovative new products creating opportunity for partners improving customer satisfaction with key audiences putting some of our most significant legal challenges behind us and solidifying internal processes our focus in fiscal 2005 is building on this foundation and executing well in key areas including continuing to innovate on our integrated software platform delivering compelling value propositions to customers responding effectively to customer and partner needs and continuing to focus internally on product excellence business efficacy and accountability across the company 

key market opportunities include 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

for fiscal 2005 we believe industrywide factors such as pc unit growth and the success of noncommercial software could significantly affect our results of operations and financial condition pc unit growth was very strong in fiscal 2004 increasing approximately 13 from fiscal 2003 we do not expect similar growth to occur in fiscal 2005 

  

 part ii 

item 7 

  

we believe that pc unit shipments will grow 7 to 9 resulting in a forecasted fiscal 2005 client revenue growth rate that we believe will be between 5 and 7 

we continue to watch the evolution of open source software development and distribution and continue to differentiate our products from competitive products including those based on open source software we believe that microsoft’s share of server units grew modestly in fiscal 2004 while linux distributions rose slightly faster on an absolute basis the increase in linux distributions reflects some significant public announcements of support and adoption of open source software in both the server and desktop markets in the last year to the extent open source software products gain increasing market acceptance sales of our products may decline which could result in a reduction in our revenue and operating margins 

additionally due primarily to our announced special dividend and quarterly dividend payments if continued we expect investment balances and resulting investment income to decrease significantly in fiscal 2005 

we have approximately 11 billion in original upgrade advantage contract value that will reach their expiration dates in the first quarter of fiscal 2005 this revenue was recognized over the last two years and in the first quarter of fiscal 2005 the contract period expires 

  

summary 

  

   

our revenue growth for fiscal 2004 was driven by licensing of windows client operating systems through oems windows server operating systems office and other server applications as a result of growth in pc and server hardware shipments and the continuing impact from multiyear licensing that occurred prior to the transition to our licensing 60 program in the first quarter of fiscal 2003 we estimate growth in pc shipments was 13 during fiscal 2004 reflecting global economic improvement which led to strength in the consumer segment in the first half of fiscal 2004 and to replacement pc and notebook sales in the enterprise segment in the second half of fiscal 2004 we estimate that total server hardware shipments grew 16 with windows server shipments growing faster than the overall sector at 18 in fiscal 2004 the net impact of foreign exchange rates on revenue was positive in fiscal 2004 primarily due to a relative strengthening of most foreign currencies versus the us dollar had the rates from the prior year been in effect in fiscal 2004 translated international revenue earned in local currencies would have been approximately 110 billion lower we hedge a portion of our international currency exposures thereby reducing our overall translation exposure prior to the july 31 2002 licensing 60 transition date we experienced a significant increase in multiyear licensing arrangements as customers enrolled in our maintenance programs primarily upgrade advantage revenue growth in fiscal 2003 was driven primarily by multiyear licensing that occurred before the licensing 60 transition date in the first quarter of fiscal 2003 the revenue growth also reflected a 933 million or 13 increase associated with oem licensing of microsoft windows operating systems and a 309 million or 23 increase in revenue from microsoft xbox video game consoles revenue growth in fiscal 2002 was led by the addition of 135 billion of xbox video game system revenue and 120 billion of revenue growth from microsoft windows xp professional and home operating systems 

for fiscal 2004 the operating income decline of 511 million was primarily caused by the 253 billion of charges related to the sun microsystems settlement and a fine imposed by the european commission in the third quarter of fiscal 2004 and 221 billion of stockbased compensation expense related to our employee stock option transfer program in the second quarter of fiscal 2004 operating income was positively influenced by the revenue growth described above and operational improvements in our msn business in fiscal 2003 the growth in operating income reflected an increase of 382 billion in revenue partially offset by an increase of 255 billion in operating expenses primarily related to employee and related costs associated with additional headcount and increased legal settlement expenses primarily the time warner settlement charge of 750 million in fiscal 2002 the growth in operating income reflected an increase of 307 billion in revenue substantially offset by an increase of 314 billion in operating expenses which included the onset of costs related to xbox video game systems 

we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas 123 accounting for stockbased compensation  on july 1 2003 and restated prior periods to reflect compensation cost under the recognition provisions of sfas 123 for 

  

 part ii 

item 7 

  

all awards granted to employees after july 1 1995 stockbased compensation expenses are included in operating expenses as part of headcountrelated costs total stockbased compensation costs included in operating expenses were 573 billion in fiscal 2004 375 billion in fiscal 2003 and 378 billion in fiscal 2002 

in fiscal 2005 we do not expect revenue to grow at similarly high rates as fiscal 2004 even if information technology spending continues to improve while we expect general economic conditions to remain stable with the improvements seen in the second half of fiscal 2004 we expect pc and server unit shipment growth rates to decline in fiscal 2005 from the high growth rates in fiscal 2004 we estimate pc shipments will grow from 7 to 9 and server unit shipments will grow from 13 to 15 in fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004 these lower growth rates may cause slower revenue growth in fiscal 2005 we are anticipating little or no yearoveryear foreign exchange rate benefit in fiscal 2005 

we anticipate that we will renew between 10 and 30 of the expiring upgrade advantage program revenue through conversions to software assurance or migration to enterprise agreements total revenue expected to be recognized in our information worker server and tools and client businesses from previously deferred upgrade advantage revenue is 56 million 

msn had a strong year in fiscal 2004 with revenue growth of 13 driven by over 40 growth in advertising revenue in fiscal 2005 we expect msn to see growth in advertising revenue and subscription and transaction revenue from premium web services partially offset by a reduction in access revenue as narrowband subscribers continue to decline accordingly we do not expect the same level of revenue growth for msn in fiscal 2005 

home and entertainment revenue grew moderately in fiscal 2004 we do not expect significant growth in home and entertainment in fiscal 2005 as price reductions in the second half of fiscal 2004 related to the late stage of the xbox lifecycle are expected to lead to lower revenue for the xbox business 

we expect our operating income growth in fiscal 2005 to exceed our revenue growth operating income is expected to reflect lower operating expenses due to the absence of certain legal settlements which occurred in fiscal 2004 lower stockbased compensation costs and benefits achieved through continued progress in our previously announced cost efficacy initiative we expect that our segments in fiscal 2004 that reported a segment operating loss – mobile and embedded devices microsoft business solutions and home and entertainment – will make significant progress toward segment profitability in fiscal 2005 with improved operations

the tables that follow below for each segment present our segment revenue and operating income determined on a basis consistent with us gaap 

  

client 

  

   

 part ii 

item 7 

  

client includes revenue from windows xp professional and home windows 2000 professional and other standard windows operating systems the growth of the client segment’s revenue is largely correlated with the growth of purchases of pcs from oems that preinstall versions of windows operating systems 

client revenue increase was driven by a 14 growth in oem licenses and 16 growth in oem revenue on increased consumer pc unit shipments in the first half of the fiscal year and growth in business pc unit shipments in the second half of fiscal 2004 revenue from commercial and retail licensing declined 4 due to lower revenue earned from upgrade advantage licensing agreements and lower packaged product sales in fiscal 2003 client revenue growth was driven by oem licensing revenue growth of 933 million and a 9 percentage point increase in the mix of the higher priced windows professional operating systems the majority of which was in the oem channel windows professional revenue growth for fiscal 2003 was 159 billion or 31 compared to fiscal 2002 the windows professional growth in fiscal 2003 was partially offset by a 573 million decline in revenue from earlier versions of windows operating systems 

client operating income was flat for fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003 due to increased operating expenses primarily related to the charge for the sun microsystems settlement of 700 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2004 and 307 million of stockbased compensation expense from the employee stock option transfer program in the second quarter of fiscal 2004 offset by growth in revenue operating income for fiscal 2003 increased primarily as a result of the 11 growth in revenue partially offset by an increase in operating expenses largely attributed to headcount additions and related costs 

we estimate that pc market growth will be from 7 to 9 in fiscal 2005 we expect emerging markets to continue to outpace mature market growth rates and we expect to hold our share in these respective markets the differential market growth rate is expected to result in lower unit license growth in the oem business and lower revenue growth as piracy continues to be problematic in emerging markets and significant price changes are not anticipated we plan to continue our efforts to increase premium product mix but expect to see only modest improvements in fiscal 2005 the client commercial and retail licensing revenues are expected to continue to lag behind overall client revenue growth we expect operating profits as a percentage of client revenue to improve in fiscal 2005 due to the legal settlements expenses and stockbased compensation expense from the employee stock option transfer program in fiscal 2004 major investments in fiscal 2005 include development of the windows client next generation operating system longhorn security programs and marketing initiatives including those related to windows xp service pack 2 and other new products 

  

server and tools 

  

   

server and tools consists of server software licenses and client access licenses cals for windows server sql server exchange server and other servers it also includes developer tools training certification microsoft press premier product support services and microsoft consulting services growth in the overall market for information technology both hardware and software is the principal driver for server and tools revenue growth the segment concentrates on licensing products applications tools content and services that make information technology professionals and developers more productive and efficient products are sold through oems distributors direct to customers and through onetime licenses or multiyear volume license agreements 

we estimate that overall server hardware shipments grew 16 in fiscal 2004 compared to the prior year server and server applications revenue including cal revenue grew 128 billion or 25 driven primarily by an estimated 18 increase in windowsbased server shipments resulting in 15 growth in new windows server licenses and by favorable conversion of revenue billed in foreign currencies to us dollars consulting and premier product support services revenue increased 189 million or 19 compared to fiscal 2003 due to increased customer penetration from new product offerings revenue from developer tools training certification and microsoft press and other services declined 128 million or 14 compared to fiscal 2003 due to recognition of revenue deferred in prior years foreign exchange rates contributed approximately 350 million or 5 of server and tools revenue growth 

  

 part ii

total server and tools revenue grew 983 million or 16 in fiscal 2003 driven by an increase in windowsbased server shipments and growth in sql server and exchange revenue windows server and cals revenue grew 787 million or 18 from fiscal 2002 as a result of increased new and anniversary multiyear licensing agreements consulting and premier product support services increased 91 million or 10 compared to fiscal 2002 revenue from developer tools training certification microsoft press and other services increased 105 million or 13 from fiscal 2002 

server and tools operating income for fiscal 2004 declined primarily due to the charge for the sun microsystems settlement of 122 billion in the third quarter of fiscal 2004 and 651 million of stockbased compensation costs from the employee stock option transfer program in the second quarter of fiscal 2004 server and tools operating income for fiscal 2003 grew 50 primarily as a result of the 16 increase in revenue 

we anticipate that overall server hardware shipments will grow from 13 to 15 in fiscal 2005 and new licenses of windows server operating system will grow slightly faster than the overall market we believe that windows server 2003 shipments will create opportunities for sales of windows server system products however we face strong competition from the linuxbased unix and other server operating systems in addition server and tools net revenue for fiscal 2005 will be unfavorably affected by the absence of revenue earned from our upgrade advantage program and no anticipated foreign exchange benefit 

  

information worker 

  

   

information worker consists of the microsoft office system of programs servers services and solutions designed to increase personal team and organization productivity information worker includes microsoft office microsoft project microsoft visio sharepoint portal server cals other information worker products including microsoft livemeeting and onenote and professional product support services most revenue from this segment comes from licensing our office system products revenue growth depends on the ability to add value to the core office product set and expand our product offerings in other information worker areas such as document lifecycle and collaboration 

revenue growth for fiscal 2004 from volume licensing retail packaged product and preinstalled versions of office in japan was 15 in aggregate this increase was driven by recognition of unearned revenue primarily from a large increase in multiyear licenses signed prior to the transition to our licensing 60 programs and approximately 110 million related to the launch of office 2003 oem licensing revenue grew 29 or 325 million foreign exchange rates provided approximately 485 million or 5 of total information worker revenue growth the 102 billion or 12 increase in revenue in fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002 was primarily due to growth in office suites revenue associated with new and anniversary multiyear licensing agreements and a 264 million or 28 increase in revenue from the combined total of microsoft project microsoft visio and other standalone applications 

information worker operating income in fiscal 2004 increased from the prior year primarily due to growth in revenue partially offset by an increase in operating expenses primarily related to 351 million of stockbased compensation expense from the employee stock option transfer program in the second quarter of fiscal 2004 and higher sales and marketing expenses information worker operating profit for fiscal 2003 grew 9 compared to fiscal 2002 led by the 12 increase in revenue and partially offset by a 20 growth in operating expenses related to headcount additions and marketing expenses 

fiscal 2005 information worker revenue is expected to be similar to fiscal 2004 we are expecting a reduction in revenue earned from our upgrade advantage licensing agreements and no anticipated foreign exchange rate benefit the significant reduction in upgrade advantage earned revenue is expected to be offset by sustained momentum in our oem and multiyear licensing offerings and increased purchasing of office system 2003 as enterprises complete their product evaluations

microsoft business solutions includes microsoft great plains microsoft navision microsoft axapta microsoft solomon microsoft crm mbnretail manager and other business applications and services our revenue is generally derived from developing and marketing integrated endtoend business applications and services designed to help small and midmarket businesses the small and midmarket business applications market is highly fragmented and is intensely competitive in all sectors microsoft business solutions revenues are affected by the general economic environment and enterprise information technology spending in particular 

the revenue increase in fiscal 2004 was primarily attributable to continued growth in licensing of navision and axapta erp products and new sales of microsoft crm microsoft business solutions revenue for fiscal 2003 grew 259 million from fiscal 2002 of which 246 million was attributable to the acquisition of navision at the beginning of the fiscal year 

the operating loss for fiscal 2004 declined from fiscal 2003 due to the increase in revenue and lower operating expenses including 42 million of lower amortization costs partially offset by 27 million in stockbased compensation expense from the employee stock option transfer program in the second quarter of fiscal 2004 microsoft business solutions operating loss for fiscal 2003 increased from fiscal 2002 primarily due to operating losses associated with navision increases in sales and marketing expenses research and development expenses and acquisitionrelated costs 

we announced in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 a plan to align and include the small and midmarket solutions  partners smsp organization in the microsoft business solutions segment this change is designed to optimize our focus on delivering business applications to small and midmarket segment businesses the smsp organization is currently part of the information worker segment this reorganization will result in a corresponding change to the microsoft business solutions and information worker reported results primarily from the reorganization of approximately 100 million in revenue and costs associated with our partner program offerings which will move from information worker segment to microsoft business solutions in fiscal 2005 we expect continued growth for microsoft business solutions through crm axapta navision and great plains product lines with increased sales and marketing focus from the smsp organization and new product launches for great plains and navision 

  

msn 

  

   

the msn segment includes personal communications services such as email and instant messaging and information services such as msn search and the msn portals and channels around the world msn also provides a variety of paid services resulting in revenue for the segment including msn internet access and msn premium web services revenue is principally generated from advertisers on msn from consumers through subscriptions and transactions generated from msn premium web services and from subscribers to msn narrowband internet access 

in fiscal 2004 msn advertising revenue increased 360 million or 43 as a result of growth in paid search and growth in the overall internet advertising market this increase was partially offset by a decline of 168 million or 15 in internet access revenue primarily from the migration of internet access subscribers to broadband or other competitively priced internet service providers revenue from subscription and transaction services other than internet access increased 71 million in fiscal 2004 to 95 million at the end of the current fiscal year msn had 43 million internet access subscribers compared to 65 million at the end of the prior fiscal year and 88 million total subscribers compared to 86 million at the end of the prior year in addition msn has over 350 million unique users

item 7 

  

monthly 187 million active hotmail accounts and 135 million active messenger accounts compared to fiscal 2002 msn advertising revenue grew 270 million or 48 in fiscal 2003 as a result of growth in paid search and strong online advertising sales across all geographic regions msn subscription revenue grew 112 million or 11 in fiscal 2003 reflecting an increase in the number of paying nonpromotion subscribers 

msn reached segment profitability in the first quarter of fiscal 2004 and was profitable for the full fiscal year the improvement in profitability was primarily driven by an increase in revenue from advertising in both display and paid search a decline in customer acquisition costs and other expenses related to the internet access business efficiency gains in the operations of the advertising and subscription businesses and a 48 million refund of prior year taxes partially offset by 144 million of stockbased compensation expense related to the employee stock option transfer program in the second quarter of fiscal 2004 msn operating loss for fiscal 2003 decreased from fiscal 2002 primarily as a result of the growth in revenue and lower relative subscription acquisition and support costs 

msn expects advertising revenue and revenue from subscriptions and transactions for premium web services to increase in fiscal 2005 advertising revenue should benefit from expected increases in internet spending and additions to the advertising platform including music download service communication innovations and an improved search engine we expect revenue from narrowband internet access to decline in fiscal 2005 as narrowband subscribers continue to migrate to broadband internet access we announced in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 an increase to the amount of storage we will provide for select msn and hotmail email accounts which will increase operating costs and may impact the revenues from our extra storage customers however we expect the segment to increase its profitability in fiscal 2005 led by continued operational efficiencies and lower unit margin costs in both the subscriber and advertising businesses 

  

mobile and embedded devices 

  

   

mobile and embedded devices includes windows mobile software windows embedded device operating systems mappoint and windows automotive the segment’s products extend the advantages of the windows platform to mobile phones and pocket pcs the segment is also responsible for managing sales and customer relations with device manufacturers and with network service providers including telecommunications cable and wireless companies and host and network equipment providers the embedded operating system market is highly fragmented with many competitive offerings and relatively short product life cycles that affect our continuing revenue streams 

unit volume increases drove revenue growth for fiscal 2004 over fiscal 2003 in all product lines the growth was primarily due to the increase in the number of oems and mobile operators shipping windows mobile software for smartphones increases in market share for our pocket pc and embedded products and increased usage by existing customers of our mappoint web service revenue for fiscal 2003 grew 44 million driven by increased pocket pc shipments and mappoint licensing 

mobile and embedded devices’ operating loss for fiscal 2004 decreased compared to fiscal 2003 primarily due to growth in revenue and lower marketing expenses partially offset by 58 million of stockbased compensation expense from the employee stock option transfer program in the second quarter of fiscal 2004 operating loss for fiscal 2003 grew 1 from the prior year as higher marketing expenses and headcountrelated costs associated with product development offset the growth in revenue 

we expect demand for mobile and embedded devices based on windows mobile software to be driven by an overall increase in customer demand for connectivity as well as by an increase in the number of oems and mobile operators offering windowsbased devices

home and entertainment 

  

   

home and entertainment includes the microsoft xbox video game console system pc games the home products division hpd and tv platform products for the interactive television industry the relative success of competing video game consoles is determined by console functionality the portfolio of video game content for the console and the relative market share of the console we are a relatively new entrant in the video game console businesses with our first release in fiscal 2002 and have established ourselves as one of the leaders revenue and unit volumes have grown quickly since 2002 but revenue growth moderated in fiscal 2004 due to price reductions typical at this stage in the console lifecycle we believe our competitive position and revenue is bolstered by our increasing software game attach rates providing higher margins to offset the decreasing price trend on consoles sold 

in fiscal 2004 xbox revenue increased 144 million or 9 with 269 million related to higher xbox software volumes and 117 million due to higher xbox console volumes partially offset by a 242 million decline related to price reductions of xbox consoles and software overall xbox console volumes increased 11 in fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003 the xbox lifetodate us games attach rate increased to 69 games per console according to industry analyst npd as of june 30 2004 revenue from consumer hardware and software pc games and tv platforms declined 16 million or 1 compared to fiscal 2003 due to lower pc games software and pc gaming devices sales partially offset by the new release of mac office the increase in home and entertainment revenue in fiscal 2003 from fiscal 2002 was the result of sales of xbox video game systems and related games which were available for all of fiscal 2003 xbox revenue grew 309 million or 23 in fiscal 2003 reflecting a 779 million increase from higher volumes for xbox consoles games and peripherals partially offset by a 470 million decrease due to price changes revenue from consumer hardware and software and pc games declined 14 million or 1 in fiscal 2003 driving the decrease in home products revenue 

the increase in operating loss in fiscal 2004 was primarily due to 141 million of stockbased compensation expense from the employee stock option transfer program in the second quarter of fiscal 2004 increased sales of negative margin consoles and costs associated with the next generation console development efforts partially offset by increased xbox and mac office software sales the operating loss increase from fiscal 2003 also included a lower of cost or market adjustment of approximately 90 million reflecting the current stage in the lifecycle of the xbox console operating loss in 2003 increased by 56 million or 5 from the prior year as the product costs associated with the increased xbox console sales and increased marketing expense more than offset the 12 increase in revenue 

in fiscal 2005 we expect xbox console unit volumes and revenue to decrease from fiscal 2004 consistent with this stage of the xbox console lifecycle partially offset by increased unit volumes driven by the launch of software titles such as halo2 in fiscal 2005 we expect pc games revenue to decrease from fiscal 2004 driven by fewer new game titles other hpd revenue are expected to increase moderately as a result of the launch of the latest version of mac office late in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 in fiscal 2005 we expect operating margins to improve from fiscal 2004 driven by lower unit volumes of negative margin consoles and increased sales of high margin software we expect development spending to be higher in fiscal 2005 driven by investment in the next generation xbox platform design

item 7 

  

cost of revenue includes manufacturing and distribution costs for products and programs sold operating costs related to product support service centers and product distribution centers costs incurred to support and maintain internetbased products and services and costs associated with the delivery of consulting services the increase in fiscal 2004 was primarily due to increased product support and consulting services costs of 508 million 214 million of stockbased compensation expense from the employee stock option transfer program and a lower of cost or market adjustment in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 by approximately 90 million reflecting the current stage of the life cycle of the xbox console partially offset by 365 million decrease in msn services costs in fiscal 2003 the primary driver of the increase was a 44 percentage point increase from home and entertainment products and a 16 percentage point decrease from msn product and service costs in fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002 

  

research and development 

  

   

research and development expenses include payroll employee benefits equity compensation and other headcountrelated costs associated with product development research and development expenses also include thirdparty development and programming costs localization costs incurred to translate software for international markets and the amortization of purchased software code and services content the increase in fiscal 2004 was primarily due to 131 billion of stockbased compensation expenses related to the option transfer program in the second quarter of fiscal 2004 as well as other headcountrelated payroll and other employee costs related to a 3 growth in research and development headcount from fiscal 2003 in fiscal 2003 the increase reflects an increase in headcountrelated costs a 25 increase in thirdparty product development costs and a 29 increase in testing laboratory equipment and expense 

  

sales and marketing 

  

   

sales and marketing expenses include payroll employee benefits equity compensation and other headcountrelated costs associated with sales and marketing personnel and advertising promotions tradeshows seminars and other marketingrelated programs sales and marketing costs increased in fiscal 2004 due to 400 million of stockbased compensation expenses related to the option transfer program in the second quarter of fiscal 2004 and other headcountrelated costs related to a 9 growth in sales and marketing headcount in fiscal 2003 the sales and marketing expense increase of 131 billion dollars was due to an increase in sales expenses related to headcount additions principally related to the enterprise and smallmedium business sales forces and a 21 increase in marketing expenses

general and administrative costs include payroll employee benefits equity compensation and other headcountrelated costs associated with the finance legal facilities certain human resources and other administrative headcount and legal costs and other administrative fees general and administrative costs increased in fiscal 2004 primarily due to legal expenses including 192 billion of charges related to the sun microsystems settlement a 605 million fine imposed by the european commission in the third quarter of fiscal 2004 280 million of stockbased compensation expense related to the employee stock option transfer program in the second quarter of fiscal 2004 other legal costs of approximately 104 million and other headcount related costs general and administrative costs in fiscal 2003 increased 583 million from fiscal 2002 due to a charge of 750 million related to a settlement with time warner in the fourth quarter of 2003 and a 256 million charge reflecting an increase in our estimate of costs related to resolving pending antitrust and unfair competition consumer class action lawsuits 

  

investment incomeloss and income taxes 

  

investment incomeloss 

  

the components of investment incomeloss in each fiscal year are as follows 

  

   

dividends and interest income decreased 65 million in fiscal 2004 mainly due to lower dividend income resulting from the exchange of att 5 convertible preferred debt for common shares of comcast during fiscal 2003 and declining interest rates partly offset by a larger investment portfolio net recognized gains losses on investments include otherthantemporary impairments of 82 million in fiscal 2004 compared to 115 billion in the prior year as well as higher net realized gains on sales in fiscal 2004 as we moved to more liquid investment asset classes net realized gains on sales were 165 billion in fiscal 2004 and 119 billion in fiscal 2003 the decline in impairments was due to improved market conditions derivative losses decreased 156 million to 268 million in fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003 primarily due to the combined effects of interest rate movements on interest rate sensitive instruments and equity market price movements relative to positions used to hedge the fair value of certain equity securities 

in fiscal 2003 dividends and interest income decreased 162 million driven primarily by a reduction in dividend income of 97 million resulting from the exchange of att 5 convertible preferred debt for common shares of comcast during the second quarter of fiscal 2003 and declining interest rates partially offset by a larger investment portfolio net recognized gains losses on investments includes otherthantemporary impairments of 115 billion in fiscal 2003 compared to 432 billion in fiscal 2002 and net realized gains on investments of 119 billion in fiscal 2003 compared to 252 billion in fiscal 2002 the decrease in otherthantemporary impairments in 2003 was also due to the reduced costbasis of investments resulting from significant 2002 impairments of investments in the cable and telecommunications sectors 

in fiscal 2002 otherthantemporary impairments of 432 billion primarily related to our investment in att and other cable and telecommunication investments net realized gains on the sales of investments of 252 billion included a 125 billion gain on sale of our interest in expedia 

investments are considered to be impaired when a decline in fair value is judged to be other than temporary we employ a systematic methodology that considers available evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments if the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value we evaluate among other factors general market conditions the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost and our intent and ability to hold the investment we also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the investee including industry and sector performance changes in technology operational and financing cash flow factors and rating agency actions once a decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary an impairment charge is recorded and a new cost basis in the investment is established

income taxes 

  

our effective tax rate for fiscal 2004 was 33 a benefit of 208 million was recorded during the fourth quarter from the reversal of previously accrued taxes from resolving the remaining open issue remanded by the 9th circuit court of appeals ruling in december 2002 the effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 was approximately 27 during the third quarter the tax rate increased due to the european commission fine which is not tax deductible 

the effective tax rate for fiscal 2003 and fiscal 2002 was 32 each year the fiscal 2003 rate reflected a benefit in the second quarter of 126 million from the reversal of previously accrued taxes related to the initial items from the 9th circuit court of appeals ruling referred to above that reversed in part a previous tax court ruling that had denied tax benefits on certain revenue earned from the distribution of software to foreign customers excluding this reversal the effective tax rate would have been 33 

  

stockbased compensation we implemented changes in fiscal 2004 in employee compensation designed to help us continue to attract and retain the best employees and to better align employee interests with those of our shareholders generally employees are now granted stock awards instead of stock options the stock award program offers employees the opportunity to earn shares of our stock over time rather than options that give employees the right to purchase stock at a set price we also completed an employee stock option transfer program in the second quarter of fiscal 2004 whereby employees could elect to transfer all of their vested and unvested stock options with a strike price of 33 or higher “eligible options” to jpmorgan chase bank jpmorgan the unvested eligible options that were transferred to jpmorgan became vested upon the transfer the price paid by jpmorgan for the transferred options was determined by reference to the arithmetic average of the closing prices of microsoft common stock during the period from november 14 2003 to december 8 2003 which was 255720 note 13 – employee stock and savings plan of the notes to the financial statements provides additional information on employee stock and savings plans 

in addition effective july 1 2003 we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas 123 accounting for stockbased compensation  using the retroactive restatement method described in sfas 148 accounting for stockbased compensation – transition and disclosure  under the fair value recognition provisions of sfas 123 stockbased compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period the june 30 2003 balance sheet has been restated for the retroactive adoption of the fair value recognition provisions of sfas 123 which resulted in a 1389 billion increase in common stock and paidin capital a 1000 billion decrease in retained earnings and a 389 billion increase in deferred income taxes 

given these changes the following table provides stockbased compensation expense for fiscal 2002 through 2004 by segment

financial condition 

  

our cash and shortterm investment portfolio totaled 6059 billion as of june 30 2004 equity and other investments were 1221 billion as of june 30 2004 the portfolio consists primarily of fixedincome securities diversified among industries and individual issuers our investments are generally liquid and investment grade the portfolio is invested predominantly in us dollar denominated securities but also includes foreign currency positions in order to diversify financial risk the portfolio is primarily invested in shortterm securities to minimize interest rate risk and facilitate rapid deployment for immediate cash needs 

unearned revenue from volume licensing programs represents customer billings paid either upfront or annually at the beginning of each billing coverage period that are accounted for as subscriptions with revenue recognized ratably over the billing coverage period for certain other licensing arrangements revenue attributable to undelivered elements including free postdelivery telephone support and the right to receive unspecified upgradesenhancements of microsoft internet explorer on a whenandifavailable basis is based on the sales price of those elements when sold separately and is recognized ratably on a straightline basis over the related product’s life cycle the percentage of revenue recorded as unearned due to undelivered elements ranges from approximately 15 to 25 of the sales price for windows xp home approximately 5 to 15 of the sales price for windows xp professional and approximately 1 to 15 of the sales price for desktop applications depending on the terms and conditions of the license and prices of the elements product life cycles are currently estimated at threeandonehalf years for windows operating systems and two years for desktop applications unearned revenue also includes payments for online advertising for which the advertisement has yet to be displayed and payments for postdelivery support services to be performed in the future 

unearned revenue as of june 30 2004 decreased 838 million from june 30 2003 reflecting recognition of unearned revenue from multiyear licensing that has outpaced additions by 397 million primarily due to recognition from upgrade advantage licensing agreements and a 489 million decline in revenue deferred for undelivered elements starting april 1 2003 revenue deferred for undelivered elements reflected lower deferral rates partially offset by lengthened product life cycles for the underlying products licensed resulting in a higher proportion of revenue earned we earned approximately 18 billion and 11 billion from the upgrade advantage programs for fiscal 2003 and 2004 respectively and expect to earn approximately 56 million in fiscal 2005 from those programs 

  

cash flows 

  

cash flow from operations for fiscal 2004 decreased 117 billion to 1463 billion the decrease primarily reflects the combined cash outflows of 256 billion related to the sun microsystems settlement and the european commission fine mentioned above partially offset by increased cash receipts from customers driven by the rise in revenue billings cash used for financing was 236 billion in fiscal 2004 a decrease of 286 billion from the prior year the decrease reflects that we did not repurchase any common stock in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 combined with a 628 million increase primarily from stock issuances related to employee stock options exercises partially offset by an 872 million increase in cash dividends paid we repurchased 1237 million shares of common stock under our share repurchase program in fiscal 2004 cash used for investing was 275 billion in fiscal 2004 a decrease of 447 billion from fiscal 2003 due to a 363 billion decrease in net investment purchases and a 106 billion decrease in acquisition spending 

cash flow from operations was 1580 billion for fiscal 2003 an increase of 129 billion from fiscal 2002 the increase primarily reflects the rise in cash receipts from customers driven by the increase in revenue billings and maintenance of relatively stable accounts receivable levels cash used for financing was 522 billion in fiscal 2003 an increase of 651 million from the prior year the increase reflects a cash dividend payment of 857 million in 2003 and an increase of 417 million in common stock repurchase offsetting 623 million received for common stock issued we repurchased 2382 million shares of common stock under our share repurchase program in fiscal 2003 cash used for investing was 721 billion in fiscal 2003 a decrease of 363 billion from fiscal 2002 due to stronger portfolio performance on sold and matured investments 

cash flow from operations was 1451 billion for fiscal 2002 an increase of 109 billion from fiscal 2001 the increase reflected strong growth in unearned revenue as a result of the significant number of customers that purchased upgrade advantage during the licensing 60 transition period this resulted in an increase in billings and a corresponding increase in the unearned revenue amount cash used for financing was 457 billion in fiscal 2002 a decrease of 101 billion from the prior year the decrease reflected the repurchase of put warrants in the prior year

we repurchased 2456 million shares of common stock under our share repurchase program in fiscal 2002 in addition 102 million shares of common stock were acquired in fiscal 2002 under a structured stock repurchase transaction we entered into the structured stock repurchase transaction in fiscal 2001 which gave us the right to acquire 102 million of our shares in exchange for an upfront net payment of 264 million cash used for investing was 1085 billion in fiscal 2002 an increase of 211 billion from fiscal 2001 

we have no material longterm debt stockholders’ equity at june 30 2004 was 748 billion we will continue to invest in sales marketing product support infrastructure and existing and advanced areas of technology additions to property and equipment will continue including new facilities and computer systems for research and development sales and marketing support and administrative staff commitments for constructing new buildings were 129 million on june 30 2004 we have operating leases for most us and international sales and support offices and certain equipment under which we incurred rental expense totaling 318 million 290 million and 331 million in fiscal 2002 2003 and 2004 respectively we have issued residual value guarantees in connection with various operating leases these guarantees provide that if we do not purchase the leased property from the lessor at the end of the lease term then we are liable to the lessor for an amount equal to the shortage if any between the proceeds from the sale of the property and an agreed value as of june 30 2004 the maximum amount of the residual value guarantees was approximately 271 million we believe that proceeds from the sale of properties under operating leases would exceed the payment obligation and therefore no liability currently exists we have not engaged in any related party transactions or arrangements with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect liquidity or the availability of requirements for capital resources 

on july 20 2004 our board of directors approved a quarterly dividend of 008 per share payable on september 14 2004 to shareholders of record on august 25 2004 in addition the board approved a plan to buy back up to 30 billion in microsoft common stock over the next four years the specific timing and amount of repurchases will vary based on market conditions securities law limitations and other factors the repurchases will be made using our cash resources the repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time without prior notice the board also approved a onetime special dividend of 300 per share or approximately 32 billion subject to shareholder approval of stock plan amendments that will allow certain adjustments to employee equity compensation awards to offset the impact of the special dividend the special dividend will be payable on december 2 2004 to shareholders of record on november 17 2004 conditioned upon shareholder approval of amendments to the employee stock plans at the annual meeting of shareholders scheduled to be held november 9 2004 

we believe existing cash and shortterm investments together with funds generated from operations should be sufficient to meet operating requirements and our special dividend as well as regular quarterly dividends our philosophy regarding the maintenance of a balance sheet with a large component of cash and shortterm investments as well as equity and other investments reflects our views on potential future capital requirements relating to research and development creation and expansion of sales distribution channels investments and acquisitions share dilution management legal risks and challenges to our business model we continuously assess our investment management approach in view of our current and potential future needs

our financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with us gaap preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses these estimates and assumptions are affected by management’s application of accounting policies critical accounting policies for us include revenue recognition impairment of investment securities impairment of goodwill accounting for research and development costs accounting for legal contingencies and accounting for income taxes 

we account for the licensing of software in accordance with american institute of certified public accountants aicpa statement of position sop 972 software revenue recognition the application of sop 972 requires judgment including whether a software arrangement includes multiple elements and if so whether vendorspecific objective evidence vsoe of fair value exists for those elements customers receive certain elements of our products over a period of time these elements include free postdelivery telephone support and the right to receive unspecified upgradesenhancements of microsoft internet explorer on a whenandifavailable basis the fair value of which is recognized over the product’s estimated life cycle changes to the elements in a software arrangement the ability to identify vsoe for those elements the fair value of the respective elements and changes to a product’s estimated life cycle could materially impact the amount of earned and unearned revenue judgment is also required to assess whether future releases of certain software represent new products or upgrades and enhancements to existing products 

sfas 115 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities and securities and exchange commission sec staff accounting bulletin sab 59 accounting for noncurrent marketable equity securities provide guidance on determining when an investment is otherthantemporarily impaired investments are reviewed quarterly for indicators of otherthantemporary impairment this determination requires significant judgment in making this judgment we evaluate among other factors the duration and extent to which the fair value of an investment is less than its cost the financial health of and nearterm business outlook for the investee including factors such as industry and sector performance changes in technology and operational and financing cash flow and our intent and ability to hold the investment investments with an indicator are further evaluated to determine the likelihood of a significant adverse affect on the fair value and amount of the impairment as necessary in the past we have had substantial impairments in our portfolio as discussed in note 4 – investment incomeloss if market industry andor investee conditions deteriorate we may incur future impairments 

sfas 142 goodwill and other intangible assets requires that goodwill be tested for impairment at the reporting unit level operating segment or one level below an operating segment on an annual basis july 1 for us and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value these events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate legal factors operating performance indicators competition sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment including the identification of reporting units assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units assignment of goodwill to reporting units and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit the fair value of each reporting unit is estimated using a discounted cash flow methodology this requires significant judgments including estimation of future cash flows which is dependent on internal forecasts estimation of the longterm rate of growth for our business the useful life over which cash flows will occur and determination of our weighted average cost of capital changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value andor goodwill impairment for each reporting unit 

we account for research and development costs in accordance with several accounting pronouncements including sfas 2 accounting for research and development costs and sfas 86 accounting for the costs of computer 

  

 part ii 

item 7 

  

software to be sold leased or otherwise marketed sfas 86 specifies that costs incurred internally in researching and developing a computer software product should be charged to expense until technological feasibility has been established for the product once technological feasibility is established all software costs should be capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers judgment is required in determining when technological feasibility of a product is established we have determined that technological feasibility for our software products is reached shortly before the products are released to manufacturing costs incurred after technological feasibility is established are not material and accordingly we expense all research and development costs when incurred 

the outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought against us are subject to significant uncertainty sfas 5 accounting for contingencies requires that an estimated loss from a loss contingency such as a legal proceeding or claim should be accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated disclosure of a contingency is required if there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss has been incurred in determining whether a loss should be accrued we evaluate among other factors the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss changes in these factors could materially impact our financial position or our results of operations 

sfas 109 accounting for income taxes establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for the effect of income taxes the objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity’s financial statements or tax returns judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our financial position or our results of operations 

  

issues and uncertainties 

  

this annual report on form 10k contains statements that are forwardlooking these statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties actual results could differ materially because of issues and uncertainties such as those listed below and elsewhere in this report which among others should be considered in evaluating our future financial performance 

  

challenges to our business model since our inception our business model has been based upon customers agreeing to pay a fee to license software developed and distributed by us under this commercial software model software developers bear the costs of converting original ideas into software products through investments in research and development offsetting these costs with the revenue received from the distribution of their products we believe the commercial software model has had substantial benefits for users of software allowing them to rely on our expertise and the expertise of other software developers that have powerful incentives to develop innovative software that is useful reliable and compatible with other software and hardware in recent years there has been a growing challenge to the commercial software model under the noncommercial software model open source software produced by loosely associated groups of unpaid programmers and made available for license to end users without charge is distributed by firms at nominal cost that earn revenue on complementary services and products without having to bear the full costs of research and development for the open source software the most notable example of open source software is the linux operating system while we believe our products provide customers with significant advantages in security and productivity and generally have a lower total cost of ownership than open source software the popularization of the noncommercial software model continues to pose a significant challenge to our business model including recent efforts by proponents of open source software to convince governments worldwide to mandate the use of open source software in their purchase and deployment of software products to the extent opens source software gains increasing market acceptance sales of our products may decline we may have to reduce the prices we charge for our products and revenue and operating margins may consequently decline 

  

intellectual property rights we defend our intellectual property rights but unlicensed copying and use of software and intellectual property rights represents a loss of revenue to us while this adversely affects us revenue the impact on revenue from outside the united states is more significant particularly in countries where laws are less protective of intellectual property rights throughout the world we actively educate consumers about the benefits of 

  

 part ii 

item 7 

  

licensing genuine products and educate lawmakers about the advantages of a business climate where intellectual property rights are protected however continued educational and enforcement efforts may not affect revenue positively and revenue could be adversely affected by further deterioration in compliance with existing legal protections or reductions in the legal protection for intellectual property rights of software developers 

from time to time we receive notices from others claiming we infringe their intellectual property rights the number of these claims may grow responding to these claims may require us to enter into royalty and licensing agreements on unfavorable terms require us to stop selling or to redesign affected products or to pay damages or to satisfy indemnification commitments with our customers if we are required to enter into such agreements or take such actions our operating margins may decline as a result 

we have made and expect to continue making significant expenditures to acquire the use of technology and intellectual property rights including via crosslicenses of broad patent portfolios 

  

unauthorized disclosure of source code source code the detailed program commands for our operating systems and software programs is the most significant asset we own while we license certain portions of our source code for various software programs and operating systems to a number of licensees we take significant measures to protect the secrecy of large portions of our source code if an unauthorized disclosure of a significant portion of our source code occurs we could potentially lose future trade secret protection for that source code the loss of future trade secret protection could make it easier for third parties to compete with our products by copying functionality which could adversely affect our revenue and operating margins unauthorized disclosure of source code could also increase certain risks described below under “security” 

  

new products and services we have made significant investments in research development and marketing for new products services and technologies including longhorn microsoft net xbox business applications msn and mobile and wireless technologies significant revenue from new product and service investments may not be achieved for a number of years if at all moreover these products and services may not be profitable and even if they are profitable operating margins for these businesses may not be as high as the margins we have experienced historically 

  

litigation as discussed in note 17 – contingencies of the notes to financial statements we are subject to a variety of claims and lawsuits adverse outcomes in some or all of the pending cases may result in significant monetary damages or injunctive relief against us we are also subject to a variety of other claims and suits that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business while management currently believes that resolving all of these matters individually or in the aggregate will not have a material adverse impact on our financial position or results of operations the litigation and other claims noted above are subject to inherent uncertainties and management’s view of these matters may change in the future there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on our financial position and the results of operations for the period in which the effect of an unfavorable final outcome becomes probable and reasonably estimable 

  

security maintaining the security of computers and computer networks is an issue of critical importance for us and our customers there are malicious hackers who develop and deploy viruses worms and other malicious software programs that attack our products while this is an industrywide phenomenon that affects computers across all platforms our customers in particular have been victims of such attacks and will likely continue to be so we are devoting significant resources to addressing these critical issues we are focusing our efforts on engineering more secure products optimizing security and reliability options and settings when we deliver products and providing guidance to help our customers make the best use of our products and services to protect against computer viruses and other attacks on their computing environment in addition we are working to improve the deployment of software updates to address security vulnerabilities discovered after our products are released we are also investing in mitigation technologies that help to secure customers from attacks even when such software updates are not deployed we are also advising customers on how to help protect themselves from security threats through the use of our online automated security tools our published security guidance and the deployment of security software such as firewalls antivirus and other security software these steps could adversely affect our operating margins despite these efforts actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products could lead some customers to seek to return products to reduce or delay future purchases or to purchase competitive products customers may also increase their expenditures on protecting their computer systems from attack which could delay adoption of new technologies any of these actions by customers could adversely affect our revenue 

  

 part ii 

item 7 

  

declines in demand for software if overall market demand for pcs servers and other computing devices declines significantly or consumer or corporate spending for such products declines our revenue will be adversely affected additionally our revenue would be unfavorably impacted if customers reduce their purchases of new software products or upgrades to existing products because new product offerings are not perceived as adding significant new functionality or other value to prospective purchasers a significant number of customers purchased license agreements providing upgrade rights to specific licensed products prior to the transition to licensing 60 in july 2002 these agreements generally expired throughout fiscal 2004 and will largely be expired by the end of the first fiscal quarter in 2005 the rate at which such customers renew these contracts could adversely affect future revenue we are making significant investments in the next release of the windows operating system codenamed longhorn if this system is not perceived as offering significant new functionality or value to prospective purchasers our revenue and operating margins could be adversely affected 

  

product development schedule the development of software products is a complex and timeconsuming process new products and enhancements to existing products can require long development and testing periods significant delays in new product releases or significant problems in creating new products particularly any delays in the longhorn operating system could adversely affect our revenue 

  

general economic and geopolitical risks softness in corporate information technology spending or other changes in general economic conditions that affect demand for computer hardware or software could adversely affect our revenue terrorist activity and armed conflict pose the additional risk of general economic disruption and could require changes in our operations and security arrangements thus increasing our operating costs these conditions lend additional uncertainty to the timing and budget for technology investment decisions by our customers 

  

competition we continue to experience intensive competition across all markets for our products and services these competitive pressures may result in decreased sales volumes price reductions andor increased operating costs such as for marketing and sales incentives resulting in lower revenue gross margins and operating income 

  

taxation of extraterritorial income in august 2001 a world trade organization “wto” dispute panel determined that the tax provisions of the fsc repeal and extraterritorial income exclusion act of 2000 “eti” constitute an export subsidy prohibited by the wto agreement on subsidies and countervailing measures the us government appealed the panel’s decision and lost its appeal on march 1 2004 the european union began imposing retaliatory tariffs on a specified list of ussource goods in may the us senate passed the jumpstart our business strength jobs act that would repeal eti provide a threeyear phaseout of current eti benefits and would replace eti with a phasedin 9 domestic production activity deduction that would not be fully effective until 2012 the us house of representatives passed similar legislation in june that would repeal eti effective december 31 2004 provide a twoyear phaseout of eti benefits and replace eti with a 3 tax rate reduction for income from domestic production activities that would be full phased in by 2006 neither bill will fully replace our current eti tax benefits both bills must still be reconciled in conference and significant changes could be made to the final legislation so we remain unable to assess the ultimate form and financial impact of this legislation if enacted if the eti provisions are repealed and financially comparable replacement tax legislation is not enacted the loss of the eti tax benefit to us could be significant 

  

other potential tax liabilities we are subject to income taxes in both the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes in the ordinary course of our business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain we are regularly under audit by tax authorities although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different than that which is reflected in historical income tax provisions and accruals should additional taxes be assessed as a result of an audit or litigation a material effect on our income tax provision and net income in the period or periods for which that determination is made could result 

  

insurance programs in addition to conventional thirdparty insurance arrangements we have entered into captive insurance arrangements for the purpose of protecting against possible catastrophic and other risks not covered by traditional insurance markets as of june 30 2004 the face value of captive insurance arrangements was 20 

  

 part ii 

item 7 7a 

  

billion actual value at any particular time will vary due to deductibles exclusions other restrictions and claims while we believe these arrangements are an effective way to insure against such risks the potential liabilities associated with certain of the issues and uncertainties discussed in this document or other events could exceed the coverage provided by such arrangements 

  

business disruptions in the event of a catastrophic event we are a highly automated business and a disruption or failure of our systems in the event of a major earthquake cyberattack terrorist attack or other catastrophic event could cause delays in completing sales and providing services our corporate headquarters a significant portion of our research and development activities and certain other critical business operations are located in the seattle washington area and we have other business operations in the silicon valley area of california both of which are near major earthquake faults a catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our critical business or information technology systems could severely affect our ability to conduct normal business operations and as a result our future operating results could be adversely affected 

  

other   other issues and uncertainties may include 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

we are exposed to foreign currency interest rate and fixed income and equity price risks a portion of these risks is hedged but fluctuations could impact our results of operations and financial position we hedge a portion of anticipated revenue and accounts receivable exposure to foreign currency fluctuations primarily with option contracts we monitor our foreign currency exposures daily to maximize the overall effectiveness of our foreign currency hedge positions principal currencies hedged include the euro japanese yen british pound and canadian dollar fixed income securities are subject to interest rate risk the portfolio is diversified and structured to minimize credit risk securities held in our equity and other investments portfolio are subject to price risk and are generally not hedged however we use options to hedge our price risk on certain equity securities that are held primarily for strategic purposes 

we use a valueatrisk var model to estimate and quantify our market risks var is the expected loss for a given confidence level in fair value of our portfolio due to adverse market movements over a defined time horizon the var model is not intended to represent actual losses in fair value but is used as a risk estimation and management tool the model used for currencies and equities is geometric brownian motion which allows incorporation of optionality with regard to these risk exposures for interest rate risk the mean reverting geometric brownian motion is used to reflect the principle that fixedincome securities prices revert to maturity value over time 

valueatrisk is calculated by first simulating 10000 market price paths over 20 days for equities interest rates and foreign exchange rates taking into account historical correlations among the different rates and prices each 

  

 part ii 

item 7a 

  

resulting unique set of equities prices interest rates and foreign exchange rates is then applied to substantially all individual holdings to reprice each holding the 250 th worst performance out of 10000 represents the valueatrisk over 20 days at the 975 percentile confidence level several risk factors are not captured in the model including liquidity risk operational risk credit risk and legal risk 

certain securities in our equity portfolio are held for strategic purposes we hedge the value of a portion of these securities through the use of derivative contracts such as putcall collars in these arrangements we hedge a security’s equity price risk below the purchased put strike and forgo most or all of the benefits of the security’s appreciation above the sold call strike in exchange for premium received for the sold call we also hold equity securities for general investment return purposes we have incurred material impairment charges related to these securities in prior periods the var amounts disclosed below are used as a risk management tool and reflect an estimate of potential reductions in fair value of our portfolio losses in fair value over a 20day holding period can exceed the reported var by significant amounts and can also accumulate over a longer time horizon than the 20day holding period used in the var analysis var amounts are not necessarily reflective of potential accounting losses including determinations of otherthantemporary losses in fair value in accordance with us gaap 

the var numbers are shown separately for interest rate currency and equity risks these var numbers include the underlying portfolio positions and related hedges we use historical data to estimate var given the reliance on historical data var is most effective in estimating risk exposures in markets in which there are no fundamental changes or shifts in market conditions an inherent limitation in var is that the distribution of past changes in market risk factors may not produce accurate predictions of future market risk 

  

the following table sets forth the var calculations for substantially all of our positions 

  

   

the total var for the combined risk categories is 835 million at june 30 2004 and 987 million at june 30 2003 the total var is 35 less at june 30 2004 and 32 less at june 30 2003 than the sum of the separate risk categories for each of those years in the above table due to the diversification benefit of the combination of risks the change in the absolute value of var is primarily due to asset allocation shifts and portfolio growth

most of our software products are developed internally we also purchase technology license intellectual property rights and oversee thirdparty development and localization of certain products we do not believe we are materially dependent upon licenses and other agreements with third parties relating to the development of our products internal development allows us to maintain closer technical control over our products and gives us the freedom to designate which modifications and enhancements are most important and when they should be implemented we work to devise innovative solutions in computer science such as making computers easier to use designing software for the next generation of hardware improving the software design process and investigating the mathematical underpinnings of computer science we have created a substantial body of development tools and have evolved development methodologies for creating and enhancing our products these tools and methodologies are also designed to simplify a product’s portability among different operating systems microprocessors and computing devices product documentation is generally created internally we strive to obtain information at the earliest possible time about changing usage patterns and hardware advances that may affect software design before releasing new software platforms we provide to application vendors a range of resources and guidelines for development training and testing 

microsoft net is our strategy and implementation of connecting people information systems and devices through the use of web services it includes everything needed to develop and deploy a web serviceconnected it architecture servers to host web services windows server system and windows server 2003 development tools to create them microsoft visual studio net 2003 and the net framework applications and smart devices that use them microsoft office system smart phones pocket pcs and pcs and a worldwide network of more than 35000 microsoft certified partner organizations – people whose skills and experience can help businesses get the most from their it investments built on industry standards web services enable applications to communicate and share data over the internet or an intranet regardless of operating system or programming language 

we believe that establishing trust in computing will be critical to our future success trustworthy computing means helping ensure a safe and reliable computing experience that is both expected and taken for granted achieving trustworthy computing will require the collaboration of hardware and software companies academic and government research institutions and policy leaders for us trustworthy computing is a companywide initiative aimed at changing how we do business that will take fundamental research and advances in engineering as well as changes to business culture and business processes to accomplish we think there are four factors that affect the level of trust that people place in computing security privacy reliability and business integrity security means the customer can expect that systems are resilient to attack and that the confidentiality integrity and availability of the system and its data are protected privacy means the customer is able to control personal information and feel confident it is not only safe and used appropriately but in a way that provides value a reliable system or

service is one the customer can depend on to fulfill its functions business integrity involves being responsive to customers addressing problems effectively with products or services and being transparent and responsive in customer interactions 

to serve the needs of users around the world we “localize” many of our products to reflect local languages and conventions and to improve the quality and usability of the product in international markets localizing a product may require modifying the user interface altering dialog boxes and translating text

competition 

  

the software business is intensely competitive and subject to rapid technological change evolving customer requirements and changing business models we face significant competition in all areas of our current business activities the rapid pace of technological change continually creates new opportunities for existing competitors and startups and can quickly render existing technologies less valuable customer requirements and preferences continually change as other information technologies emerge or become less expensive and as emerging concerns such as security and privacy become of paramount concern we face direct competition with firms adopting alternative business models to the commercial software model firms adopting the open source model typically provide customers with open source software at nominal cost and earn revenue on complimentary services and products without having to bear the full costs of research and development for the open source software additionally global software piracy – the unlawful copying and distribution of our copyrighted software products – deprives us of large amounts of revenue on an annual basis further the existing versions of our products licensed to our installed base of users compete with future versions this means that future versions must deliver significant additional value in order to induce existing customers to purchase a new version of our product 

our competitive position may be adversely affected in the future by one or more of the factors described in this section 

  

client 

  

although we are the leader in operating system software products we face strong competition from well established companies and entities with differing approaches to the market competing commercial software products including variants of unix are supplied by competitors such as ibm hewlettpackard apple computer sun microsystems and others who are vertically integrated in both software development and hardware manufacturing and have developed operating systems that they preinstall on their own computers personal computer oems who preinstall third party operating systems may also license these firms’ operating systems or open source software especially offerings based on linux variants of unix run on a wide variety of computer platforms and have gained increasing acceptance as desktop operating systems in part due to the increasing performance of standard hardware components at decreasing prices the linux open source operating system which is also derived from unix and is available without payment under a general public license has gained increasing acceptance as its feature set increasingly resembles the distinct and innovative features of windows and as competitive pressures on personal computer oems to reduce costs continue to increase the microsoft windows operating systems also face competition from alternative platforms such as those based on internet browsing software and java technology promoted by sun microsystems as well as innovative form factors that may reduce consumer demand for traditional personal computers we believe our operating system products compete effectively by delivering better innovation overall value an easytouse interface compatibility with a broad range of hardware and software applications and the largest support network for any operating system 

  

server and tools 

  

our server operating system products face intense competition from a wide variety of competing server operating systems and server applications offered by firms with a variety of market approaches several vertically integrated computer manufacturers such as ibm hewlettpackard apple computer sun microsystems and others offer their own variant of unix preinstalled on server hardware and virtually all computer manufacturers offer server hardware for the linux operating system ibm’s endorsement of linux has accelerated its acceptance as an alternative to both traditional unix and windows server operating systems linux’s competitive position has also benefited from the large number of compatible applications now produced by many leading commercial software developers as well as open source community developers a number of companies supply versions of linux including red hat and va linux 

we compete in the business of providing enterprisewide computing solutions with several companies that provide competing solutions as well as middleware technology platforms ibm and sun microsystems lead a group of companies focused on the java 2 platform enterprise edition j2ee commercial software developers that provide competing server applications for the pcbased

distributed clientserver environments include oracle ibm computer associates sybase and informix there are also a number of open source server applications available 

numerous commercial software vendors offer competing commercial software applications for connectivity both internet and intranet security hosting and ebusiness servers additionally ibm has a large installed base of lotus notes and ccmail both of which compete with our collaboration and email products there are also a significant number of open source software products that compete with microsoft solutions including apache web server 

the open source model of linux and other server programs enables both services and hardware companies to provide customers with open source software at nominal cost and earn revenue on complimentary services and products without having to bear the full costs of research and development for the open source software for example ibm with the largest hardware and services businesses in the industry promotes linux extensively and seeks to earn revenues and profits on the sale of its consulting services to implement the linux server solution as well as related hardware and commercial software products that run on linux 

our developer products compete against offerings from bea systems borland ibm macromedia oracle sun microsystems sybase and other companies 

we believe that our server products provide customers with significant advantages in innovation performance both relative to total costs of ownership and in absolute terms productivity applications development tools and environment compatibility with a broad base of hardware and software applications security and manageability 

  

information worker 

  

while we are the leader in business productivity software applications competitors to the microsoft office system include many software application vendors such as apple corel ibm oracle qualcomm sun microsystems and local application developers in europe and asia ibm and corel have significant installed bases with their spreadsheet and word processor products respectively and both have aggressive pricing strategies also apple and ibm preinstall certain of their application software products on various models of their pcs competing directly with our applications corel’s suite and sun microsystems’ star office are aggressively priced and attractive for oems to preinstall on lowpriced pcs the openofficeorg project provides a freely downloadable crossplatform application that is gaining popularity in certain market segments in addition to traditional clientside applications webbased applications hosting services such as simdesk provide an alternative to microsoft office and are gaining some support we believe that our products compete effectively by providing customers significant benefits such as easytouse personal productivity support for effective teaming and collaboration and better information management and control 

  

microsoft business solutions 

  

the small and midmarket business applications market globally is highly fragmented and is intensely competitive in all sectors we face competition from a large number of companies in this business wellknown vendors focused on small and midmarket business such as intuit and sage compete against us for a portion of this segment in addition largeenterprise focused vendors such as oracle peoplesoft and sap also compete against us for a portion of this segment however the competition for a significant majority of the total business applications market includes thousands of much smaller vendors in specific localities or industries who offer their own enterprise resource planning customer relationship management andor analytic solutions 

  

msn 

  

msn competes with aoltime warner google yahoo and a vast array of web sites and portals that offer content of all types such as email instant messaging calendaring chat search and shopping services as the broadband access market grows we expect to have increasing opportunity to deliver premium subscription services for consumers aol and yahoo are both pursuing similar strategies and will be competitors in this emerging category while the movement to broadband access may cause our internet access dialup business to continue to decline we will strive to convert customers to msn premium subscription services via partnerships with network providers and internet software services offered directly from msn we believe our strengths are our heritage of technology innovation particularly in communication services distribution partnerships and the large base of users of our free msn network additionally while our advertising business has grown considerably over the last year evolving market conditions particularly paid search will impact our strategy over the next year we currently are building our own search engine and investing to support the continued growth of our advertising business 

  

mobile and embedded devices 

  

windows mobile software faces substantial competition from nokia openwave systems palmsource qualcomm and symbian the embedded operating system market is highly fragmented with many competitive offerings key competitors include ibm wind river and versions of embeddable linux from commercial linux vendors such as metrowerks and montavista software mappoint competitors include delorme mapinfo mapquestcom rand mcnally webraska mobile technologies and yahoo the telematics market is also highly fragmented with competitive offerings from ibm and automotive suppliers building on various realtime operating system platforms from commercial linux vendors qnx software systems wind river and others 

  

home and entertainment 

  

the home and entertainment business is highly competitive and is characterized by limited platform life cycles frequent introductions of new products and titles and the development of new technologies the markets for our products are characterized by significant price competition and we anticipate continued pricing pressure from our competitors these pressures have from time to time required us to reduce prices on certain products our competitors vary in size from very small companies with limited resources to very large diversified corporations with substantial financial and marketing resources we compete primarily on the basis of price product quality and variety timing of product releases and effectiveness of distribution and marketing

revenue 

  

our revenue growth rate was 10 in fiscal 2001 12 in fiscal 2002 and 13 in fiscal 2003 revenue growth in fiscal 2003 was driven primarily by multiyear licensing that occurred before the transition to our new licensing program licensing 60 in the first quarter of fiscal 2003 prior to the july 31 2002 transition date to licensing 60 we experienced significant growth in multiyear licensing arrangements as customers enrolled in our maintenance programs including upgrade advantage and software assurance the revenue growth also reflected a 933 million or 13 increase associated with oem licensing of microsoft windows operating systems and a 309 million or 23 increase in revenue from microsoft xbox video game consoles revenue growth in fiscal 2002 was led by the addition of 135 billion of xbox video game system revenue and 120 billion of revenue growth from microsoft windows xp professional and home operating systems revenue growth in fiscal 2001 was driven primarily by licensing of microsoft windows 2000 professional with 101 billion growth in revenue from professional operating systems and server and tools revenue growth of 852 million 

during the second quarter of fiscal 2002 we launched a new licensing program licensing 60 for volume licensing customers licensing 60 simplifies and improves our volume licensing program with software assurance which gives customers the right to install any new release of products covered in the licensing agreement during the term of their coverage the level of customer adoption of our new volume licensing programs will affect the mix of multiyear licensing agreements with a resulting impact on the timing of revenue recognition in addition the timing and extent of a recovery in consumer and corporate spending on pcs and information technology will be factors affecting revenue growth 

  

consolidated operating income 

  

operating income grew 6 in fiscal 2001 2 in fiscal 2002 and 11 in fiscal 2003 in fiscal 2003 the growth in operating income reflected an increase of 382 billion in revenue partially offset by an increase of 252 billion in operating expenses primarily related to employee and related costs associated with additional headcount and increased legal settlement expenses in fiscal 2002 the growth in operating income reflected an increase of 307 billion in revenue substantially offset by an increase of 288 billion in operating expenses which included the onset of costs related to xbox video game systems in fiscal 2001 the growth in operating income reflected an increase of 234 billion in revenue partially offset by an increase of 163 billion in operating expenses

client 

  

client revenue was 817 billion 936 billion and 1039 billion in 2001 2002 and 2003 client includes revenue from windows xp professional and home windows 2000 professional and other standard windows operating systems in 2003 client revenue growth was driven by oem licensing revenue growth of 933 million and a 9 percentage point increase of the mix of the higher priced windows professional operating systems the majority of which was in the oem channel windows professional revenue growth for fiscal 2003 was 159 billion or 31 compared to fiscal 2002 partially offset by a 573 million decline in revenue of 

  

   

part ii item 7 

  

earlier versions of windows operating systems client operating profit for fiscal 2003 increased 11 primarily as a result of the 11 growth in revenue partially offset by an increase in operating expenses largely attributed to headcount additions and related costs 

in fiscal 2002 the growth in client revenue reflected strong multiyear licensing revenue growth and a continued shift of sales to the higher priced windows 2000 and windows xp professional operating system licensed through oems oem revenue grew 939 million despite a 5 decline in reported oem unit shipments fiscal 2001 revenue growth reflected the strong adoption of windows 2000 professional with professional operating systems revenue growth of 101 billion and a 7 percentage point mix increase to the higher priced windows 2000 professional and windows nt workstation operating systems and a 91 million increase in revenue from windows me and windows 98 operating systems 

we do not expect the revenue growth attributed to the mix toward the higher priced windows professional operating system to continue at previous levels into fiscal 2004 additionally variability between the reported oem unit shipments and the underlying pc market may continue as a result of the transition to new oem licensing terms at the beginning of fiscal year 2003 under which oems are billed upon their acquisition of certificates of authenticity coas rather than upon the shipment of pcs to their customers 

  

server and tools 

  

server and tools revenue was 584 billion 616 billion and 714 billion in 2001 2002 and 2003 server and tools consists of server software licenses and client access licenses cals for windows server sql server exchange server and other servers it also includes developer tools training certification microsoft press premier product support services and microsoft consulting services total server and tools revenue grew 983 million or 16 in fiscal 2003 driven by an increase in windowsbased server shipments and growth in sql server and exchange revenue server revenue including cals grew 787 million or 18 from fiscal 2002 as a result of increased new and anniversary multiyear licensing agreements consulting and premier product support services increased 91 million or 10 compared to fiscal 2002 revenue from developer tools training certification microsoft press and other services increased 105 million or 13 server operating profit for fiscal 2003 grew 20 primarily as a result of the 16 increase in revenue

nonoperating items 

  

losses on equity investees and other consist of our share of income or loss from investments accounted for using the equity method and income or loss attributable to minority interests the decrease in losses on equity investees and other in fiscal 2003 and 2002 was due to the divestiture of certain equity investments in fiscal 2002 in conjunction with the underlying performance of such entities the increase in losses on equity investees and other in fiscal 2001 reflected an increase in the number of such investments during the year 

  

investment incomeloss 

  

we recorded net investment incomeloss in each year as follows 

  

   

investments are considered to be impaired when a decline in fair value is judged to be otherthantemporary we employ a systematic methodology that considers available evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments if the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value we evaluate among other factors general market conditions the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost as well as our intent and ability to hold the investment we also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the investee including industry and sector performance changes in technology operational and financing cash flow factors and rating agency actions once a decline in fair value is determined to be otherthantemporary an impairment charge is recorded and a new cost basis in the investment is established 

in fiscal 2003 otherthantemporary impairments decreased mainly due to the lack of significant continued impairments in the cable and telecommunications sectors interest income decreased 65 million due to declining interest rates partially offset by a larger investment portfolio dividend income decreased 97 million primarily related to the exchange of att 5 convertible preferred debt for common shares of att corporation during the year

income taxes 

  

our effective tax rate for fiscal 2003 was 32 reflecting a onetime benefit in the second quarter of 126 million from the reversal of previously accrued taxes the tax reversal stems from a 9th circuit court of appeals ruling in december 2002 overturning a previous tax court ruling that had denied tax benefits on certain revenue earned from the distribution of software to foreign customers excluding this reversal the effective tax rate would have been 33 the effective tax rate for fiscal 2001 and fiscal 2002 was 33 and 32 respectively 

  

accounting changes 

  

effective july 1 2001 we adopted sfas 141 business combinations and sfas 142 goodwill and other intangible assets  sfas 141 requires business combinations to be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting it also specifies the types of acquired intangible assets that are required to be recognized and reported separate from goodwill sfas 142 requires that goodwill and certain intangibles no longer be amortized but instead tested for impairment at least annually there was no impairment of goodwill upon adoption of sfas 142 goodwill amortization on a pretax basis was 311 million in fiscal 2001 

effective july 1 2000 we adopted sfas 133 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities which establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts and for hedging activities the adoption of sfas 133 resulted in a cumulative pretax reduction to income of 560 million 375 million aftertax and a cumulative pretax reduction to other comprehensive income oci of 112 million 75 million aftertax the reduction to income was mostly attributable to a loss of approximately 300 million reclassified from oci for the time value of options and a loss of approximately 250 million reclassified from oci for derivatives not designated as hedging instruments the reduction to oci was mostly attributable to losses of approximately 670 million on cash flow hedges offset by the reclassifications out of oci of the approximately 300 million loss for the time value of options and the approximately 250 million loss for derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments 

  

stockbased compensation 

  

on july 8 2003 we announced changes in employee compensation designed to help us continue to attract and retain the best employees and to better align employee interests with those of our shareholders employees will be granted stock awards instead of stock options the stock award program offers employees the opportunity to earn actual shares of our stock over time rather than options that give employees the right to purchase stock at a set price as part of the changes we announced that a significant portion of stockbased compensation for more than 600 of our senior leaders will depend on growth in the number and satisfaction of our customers we also indicated that we are working on a plan to enable employees to realize some value on the portion of their stock options that are currently outofthemoney by selling their options to a thirdparty financial institution if approved we expect to implement this plan by the end of 2003 

in addition to announcing changes to our employee compensation arrangements we also indicated that we will adopt the fair value recognition provisions of sfas 123 accounting for stockbased compensation effective july 1 2003 and will report that change in accounting principle using the retroactive restatement method described in sfas 148 accounting for stockbased compensation—transition and disclosure  note 16 of the notes to the financial statements provides pro forma income statements for 2001 2002 and 2003 as if compensation cost for our stock option and employee stock purchase plans had been determined as prescribed by sfas 123

unearned revenue as of june 30 2003 was 902 billion increasing 127 billion from june 30 2002 reflecting the addition of new and anniversary multiyear licensing agreements partially offset by continued recognition of unearned revenue from multiyear licensing in prior periods 

cash flow from operations was 1580 billion for fiscal 2003 an increase of 129 billion from fiscal 2002 the increase reflects a 216 billion increase in net income from fiscal year 2002 and an increase of 137 billion in unearned revenue offset by an increase of 236 billion in recognition of unearned revenue cash used for financing was 522 billion in fiscal 2003 an increase of 651 million from the prior year the increase reflects a cash dividend payment of 857 million in 2003 and an increase of 417 million in common stock repurchase offsetting 623 million received for common stock issued we repurchased 2382 million shares of common stock under our share repurchase program in fiscal 2003 cash used for investing was 721 billion in fiscal 2003 a decrease of 363 billion from fiscal 2002 due to stronger portfolio performance on sold and matured investments 

cash flow from operations was 1451 billion for fiscal 2002 an increase of 109 billion from fiscal 2001 the increase reflected strong growth in unearned revenue as a result of the significant number of customers that purchased upgrade advantage during the licensing 60 transition period this resulted in an increase in billings and a corresponding increase in the unearned revenue amount cash used for financing was 457 billion in fiscal 2002 a decrease of 101 billion from the prior year the decrease reflected the repurchase of put warrants in the prior year we repurchased 2456 million shares of common stock under our share repurchase program in fiscal 2002 in addition 102 million shares of common stock were acquired in fiscal 2002 under a structured stock repurchase transaction we entered into the structured stock repurchase transaction in fiscal 2001 which gave us the right to acquire 102 million of our shares in exchange for an upfront net payment of 264 million cash used for investing was 1085 billion in fiscal 2002 an increase of 211 billion from fiscal 2001 

  

   

part ii item 7 

  

cash flow from operations was 1342 billion in fiscal 2001 an increase of 200 billion from the prior year the increase was primarily attributable to the growth in revenue and other changes in working capital partially offset by a decrease in the stock option income tax benefit reflecting decreased stock option exercises by employees cash used for financing was 559 billion in fiscal 2001 an increase of 339 billion from the prior year the increase primarily reflected the repurchase of put warrants in fiscal 2001 compared to the sale of put warrants in the prior fiscal year as well as an increase in common stock repurchased all outstanding put warrants were either retired or exercised during fiscal 2001 during fiscal 2001 we repurchased 1781 million shares cash used for investing was 873 billion in fiscal 2001 a decrease of 658 million from the prior year 

we have no material longterm debt stockholders’ equity at june 30 2003 was 6102 billion we will continue to invest in sales marketing product support infrastructure and existing and advanced areas of technology additions to property and equipment will continue including new facilities and computer systems for rd sales and marketing support and administrative staff commitments for constructing new buildings were 117 million on june 30 2003 we have not engaged in any related party transactions or arrangements with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect liquidity or the availability of or requirements for capital resources 

we believe existing cash and shortterm investments together with funds generated from operations should be sufficient to meet operating requirements our philosophy regarding the maintenance of a balance sheet with a large component of cash and shortterm investments as well as equity and other investments reflects our views on potential future capital requirements relating to research and development creation and expansion of sales distribution channels investments and acquisitions share dilution management legal risks and challenges to our business model we continuously assess our investment management approach in view of our current and potential future needs 

  

offbalance sheet arrangements 

  

we have operating leases for most us and international sales and support offices and certain equipment rental expense for operating leases was 281 million 318 million and 290 million in 2001 2002 and 2003 respectively future minimum rental commitments under noncancellable leases in millions of dollars are 2004 218 2005 202 2006 172 2007 134 2008 116 and thereafter 429 

we have unconditionally guaranteed the repayment of certain japanese yen denominated bank loans and related interest and fees of jupiter telecommunication ltd a japanese cable company jupiter these guarantees arose on february 1 2003 in conjunction with the expiration of prior financing arrangements including previous guarantees by us the financing arrangements were entered into by jupiter as part of financing its operations as part of jupiter’s new financing agreement we agreed to guarantee repayment by jupiter of the loans of approximately 51 million the estimated fair value and the carrying value of the guarantees was 105 million and did not result in a charge to operations the guarantees are in effect until the earlier of repayment of the loans including accrued interest and fees or february 1 2009 the maximum amount of the guarantees is limited to the sum of the total due and unpaid principal amounts accrued and unpaid interest and any other related expenses additionally the maximum amount of the guarantees denominated in japanese yen will vary based on fluctuations in foreign exchange rates if we were required to make payments under the guarantees we may recover all or a portion of those payments upon liquidation of jupiter’s assets the proceeds from such liquidation cannot be accurately estimated due to the multitude of factors that would affect the valuation and realization of the proceeds in the event of liquidation 

in connection with various operating leases we issued residual value guarantees which provide that if we do not purchase the leased property from the lessor at the end of the lease term then we are liable to the lessor for an amount equal to the shortage if any between the proceeds from the sale of the property and an agreed value as of june 30 2003 the maximum amount of the residual value guarantees was approximately 271 million we believe that proceeds from the sale of properties under operating leases would exceed the payment obligation and therefore no liability to us currently exists 

we provide indemnifications of varying scope and size to certain customers against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products we evaluate estimated losses for such indemnifications under sfas 5 accounting for contingencies  as interpreted by fin 45 we consider such factors as the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss to date we have not encountered material costs as a result of such obligations and have not accrued any liabilities related to such indemnifications in our financial statements 

  

recently issued accounting standards 

  

in january 2003 the fasb issued interpretation 46 consolidation of variable interest entities in general a variable interest entity is a corporation partnership trust or any other legal structure used for business purposes that either a does not have equity investors with voting rights or b has equity investors that do not provide sufficient financial resources for the entity to support its activities interpretation 46 requires a variable interest entity to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entity’s activities or entitled to receive a majority of the entity’s residual returns or both the consolidation requirements of interpretation 46 apply immediately to variable interest entities created after january 31 2003 the consolidation requirements apply to transactions entered into prior to february 1 2003 in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after june 15 2003 certain of the disclosure requirements apply in all financial statements issued after january 31 2003 regardless of when the variable interest entity was established the adoption of the interpretation on july 1 2003 did not have a material impact on our financial statements

characteristics of both liabilities and equity it requires that an issuer classify a financial instrument that is within its scope as a liability or an asset in some circumstances it is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may 31 2003 and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june 15 2003 while we do not believe the adoption of this statement will have a material impact on our financial statements we continue to assess the impact this statement will have on certain of our share repurchase programs 

  

application of critical accounting policies 

  

our financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with us gaap preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses these estimates and assumptions are affected by management’s application of accounting policies critical accounting policies for us include revenue recognition impairment of investment securities impairment of goodwill accounting for research and development costs accounting for legal contingencies and accounting for income taxes 

we account for the licensing of software in accordance with american institute of certified public accountants aicpa statement of position sop 972 software revenue recognition the application of sop 972 requires judgment including whether a software arrangement includes multiple elements and if so whether vendorspecific objective evidence vsoe of fair value exists for those elements end users receive certain elements of our products over a period of time these elements include free postdelivery telephone support and the right to receive unspecified upgradesenhancements of microsoft internet explorer on a whenandifavailable basis the fair value of which is recognized over the product’s estimated life cycle changes to the elements in a software arrangement the ability to identify vsoe for those elements the fair value of the respective elements and changes to a product’s estimated life cycle could materially impact the amount of earned and unearned revenue judgment is also required to assess whether future releases of certain software represent new products or upgrades and enhancements to existing products 

sfas 115 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  and securities and exchange commission sec staff accounting bulletin sab 59 accounting for noncurrent marketable equity securities  provide guidance on determining when an investment is otherthantemporarily impaired this determination requires significant judgment in making this judgment we evaluate among other factors the duration and extent to which the fair value of an investment is less than its cost the financial health of and nearterm business outlook for the investee including factors such as industry and sector performance changes in technology and operational and financing cash flow and our intent and ability to hold the investment 

sfas 142 goodwill and other intangible assets  requires that goodwill be tested for impairment at the reporting unit level operating segment or one level below an operating segment on an annual basis july 1 st for microsoft and between annual tests in certain circumstances application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment including the identification of reporting units assigning assets and liabilities to reporting units assigning goodwill to reporting units and determining the fair value of each reporting unit significant judgments required to estimate the fair value of reporting units include estimating future cash flows determining appropriate discount rates and other assumptions changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value andor goodwill impairment for each reporting unit 

we account for research and development costs in accordance with several accounting pronouncements including sfas 2 accounting for research and development costs  and sfas 86 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold leased or otherwise marketed sfas 86 specifies that costs incurred internally in creating a computer software product should be charged to expense when incurred as research and development until technological feasibility has been established for the product once technological feasibility is established all software costs should be capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers judgment is required in determining when technological feasibility of a product is established we have determined that technological feasibility for our products is reached shortly before the products are released to manufacturing costs incurred after technological feasibility is established are not material and accordingly we expense all research and development costs when incurred 

we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims the outcomes of which are subject to significant uncertainty sfas 5 accounting for contingencies  requires that an estimated loss from a loss contingency should be accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated disclosure of a contingency is required if there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss has been incurred we evaluate among other factors the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss changes in these factors could materially impact our financial position or our results of operations 

sfas 109 accounting for income taxes  establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for the effect of income taxes the objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity’s financial statements or tax returns judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns fluctuations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our financial position or our results of operations 

  

issues and uncertainties 

  

this annual report on form 10k contains statements that are forwardlooking these statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties actual results could differ materially because of issues and uncertainties such as those listed below and elsewhere in this report which among others should be considered in evaluating our financial outlook 

  

challenges to our business model 

  

since our inception our business model has been based upon customers agreeing to pay a fee to license software developed and distributed by us under this commercial software model software developers bear the costs of converting original ideas into software products through investments in research and development offsetting these costs with the revenues received from the distribution of their products we believe the commercial software model has had substantial benefits for users of software allowing them to rely on our expertise and the expertise of other software developers that have powerful incentives to develop 

  

   

part ii item 7 

  

innovative software that is useful reliable and compatible with other software and hardware in recent years there has been a growing challenge to the commercial software model often referred to as the open source model under the open source model software is produced by loosely associated groups of unpaid programmers and the resulting software and the intellectual property contained therein is licensed to end users at substantially no cost the most notable example of open source software is the linux operating system while we believe that our products provide customers with significant advantages in security and productivity and generally have a lower total cost of ownership than open source software the popularization of the open source model continues to pose a significant challenge to our business model including recent efforts by proponents of the open source model to convince governments worldwide to mandate the use of open source software in their purchase and deployment of software products to the extent the open source model gains increasing market acceptance sales of our products may decline we may have to reduce the prices we charge for our products and revenues and operating margins may consequently decline 

  

intellectual property rights 

  

we defend our intellectual property rights but unlicensed copying and use of software and intellectual property rights represents a loss of revenue to us while this adversely affects us revenue the impact on revenue from outside the united states is more significant particularly in countries where laws are less protective of intellectual property rights throughout the world we actively educate consumers about the benefits of licensing genuine products and educate lawmakers about the advantages of a business climate where intellectual property rights are protected however continued educational and enforcement efforts may not affect revenue positively and further deterioration in compliance with existing legal protections or reductions in the legal protection for intellectual property rights of software developers could adversely affect revenue 

from time to time we receive notices from others claiming we infringe their intellectual property rights the number of these claims may grow responding to these claims may require us to enter into royalty and licensing agreements on unfavorable terms require us to stop selling or to redesign affected products or to pay damages or to satisfy indemnification commitments with our customers 

we have made and expect to continue making significant expenditures to acquire the use of technology and intellectual property rights including via crosslicenses of broad patent portfolios 

  

new products and services 

  

we have made significant investments in research development and marketing for new products services and technologies including microsoft net xbox business applications msn mobile and wireless technologies and television significant revenue from new product and service investments may not be achieved for a number of years if at all moreover these products and services may never be profitable and even if they are profitable operating margins for these businesses are not expected to be as high as the margins historically experienced by us 

  

litigation 

  

as discussed in note 20 – contingencies of the notes to financial statements we are subject to a variety of claims and lawsuits while we believe that none of the litigation matters in which we are currently involved will have a material adverse impact on our financial position or results of operations it is possible that one or more of these matters could be resolved in a manner that ultimately would have a material adverse impact on our business and could negatively impact our revenues operating margins and net income 

  

declines in demand for software 

  

if overall market demand for pcs servers and other computing devices declines significantly or consumer or corporate spending for such products declines our revenue will be adversely affected additionally our revenues would be unfavorably impacted if customers reduce their purchases of new software products or upgrades to existing products because new product offerings are not perceived as adding significant new functionality or other value to prospective purchasers a significant number of customers purchased license agreements providing upgrade rights to specific licensed products prior to the transition to licensing 60 in july 2002 these agreements will expire in 2004 and 2005 and the rate at which such customers renew these contracts could adversely affect future revenues we are also committing significant investments in the next release of the windows operating system codenamed longhorn if this system is not perceived as offering significant new functionality or value to prospective purchasers our revenues and operating margins could be adversely affected 

  

product development schedule 

  

the development of software products is a complex and timeconsuming process new products and enhancements to existing products can require long development and testing periods significant delays in new product releases or significant problems in creating new products particularly any delays in the longhorn operating system could adversely affect our revenues 

  

general economic and geopolitical risks 

  

continued softness in corporate information technology spending or other changes in general economic conditions that affect demand for computer hardware or software could adversely affect our revenues terrorist activity and armed conflict pose the additional risk of general economic disruption and could require changes in our international operations and security arrangements thus increasing our operating costs these conditions lend additional uncertainty to the timing and budget for technology investment decisions by our customers 

  

competition 

  

we continue to experience intensive competition across all markets for our products and services these competitive pressures may result in decreased sales volumes price reductions andor increased operating costs such as for marketing and sales incentives resulting in lower revenues gross margins and operating income 

  

taxation of extraterritorial income 

  

in august 2001 a world trade organization “wto” dispute panel determined that the tax provisions of the fsc repeal and extraterritorial income exclusion act of 2000 “eti” constitute an export subsidy prohibited by the wto agreement on subsidies 

  

   

part ii item 7 7a 

  

and countervailing measures the us government appealed the panel’s decision and lost its appeal if the eti provisions are repealed and financially comparable replacement tax legislation is not enacted the loss of the eti tax benefit to us could be significant 

  

other potential tax liabilities 

  

we are subject to income taxes in both the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes in the ordinary course of our business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain we are regularly under audit by tax authorities although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different than that which is reflected in historical income tax provisions and accruals should additional taxes be assessed as a result of an audit or litigation a material effect on our income tax provision and net income in the period or periods for which that determination is made could result 

  

finite insurance programs 

  

in addition to conventional third party insurance arrangements we have entered into captive insurance arrangements for the purpose of protecting against possible catastrophic and other risks not covered by traditional insurance markets as of june 30 2003 potential coverage available under captive insurance arrangements was 10 billion subject to deductibles exclusions and other restrictions while we believe these arrangements are an effective way to insure against such risks the potential liabilities associated with certain of the issues and uncertainties discussed herein could exceed the coverage provided by such arrangements 

  

other 

  

other issues and uncertainties may include 

  

   

   

   

   

   




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

we are exposed to foreign currency interest rate and fixed income and equity price risks a portion of these risks is hedged but fluctuations could impact our results of operations and financial position we hedge a portion of anticipated revenue and accounts receivable exposure to foreign currency fluctuations primarily with option contracts we monitor our foreign currency exposures daily to maximize the overall effectiveness of our foreign currency hedge positions principal currencies hedged include the euro japanese yen british pound and canadian dollar fixed income securities are subject to interest rate risk the portfolio is diversified and structured to minimize credit risk we routinely use options to hedge a portion of our exposure to interest rate risk in the event of a catastrophic increase in interest rates securities held in our equity and other investments portfolio are subject to price risk and are generally not hedged however we use options to hedge our price risk on certain highly volatile equity securities that are held primarily for strategic purposes 

we use a valueatrisk var model to estimate and quantify our market risks var is the expected loss for a given confidence level in fair value of our portfolio due to adverse market movements over a defined time horizon the var model is not intended to represent actual losses in fair value but is used as a risk estimation and management tool the model used for currencies and equities is geometric brownian motion which allows incorporation of optionality with regard to these risk exposures for interest rate risk the mean reverting geometric brownian motion is used to reflect the principle that fixedincome securities prices revert to maturity value over time 

valueatrisk is calculated by first simulating 10000 market price paths over 20 days for equities interest rates and foreign exchange rates taking into account historical correlations among the different rates and prices each resulting unique set of equities prices interest rates and foreign exchange rates is applied to substantially all individual holdings to reprice each holding the 250 th worst performance out of 10000 represents the valueatrisk over 20 days at the 975 th percentile confidence level several risk factors are not captured in the model including liquidity risk operational risk credit risk and legal risk 

certain securities in our equity portfolio are held for strategic purposes we hedge the value of a portion of these securities through the use of derivative contracts such as putcall collars in these arrangements we hedge a security’s market risk below the purchased put strike and forgo most or all of the benefits of the security’s appreciation above the sold call strike in exchange for premium received for the sold call we also hold equity securities for general investment return purposes we have incurred material impairment charges related to these securities the var amounts disclosed below are used as a risk management tool and reflect an estimate of potential reductions in fair value of our portfolio losses in fair value over a 20day holding period can exceed the reported var by significant amounts and can also accumulate over a longer time horizon than the 20day holding period used in the var analysis var amounts are not necessarily reflective of potential accounting losses including determinations of otherthantemporary losses in fair value in accordance with us gaap 

the var numbers are shown separately for interest rate currency and equity risks these var numbers include the underlying portfolio positions and related hedges we use historical data to estimate var given reliance on historical data var is most effective in estimating risk exposures in markets in which there are no fundamental changes or shifts in market conditions an inherent limitation in var is that the distribution of past changes in market risk factors may not produce accurate predictions of future market risk 

  

   

part ii item 7a 8 

  

the following table sets forth the var calculations for substantially all of our positions 

  

   

the total var for the combined risk categories is 987 million at june 30 2003 and 908 million at june 30 2002 the total var is 32 less at june 30 2003 and 34 less at june 30 2002 than the sum of the separate risk categories for each of those years in the above table due to the diversification benefit of the combination of risks the reasons for the change in risk in portfolios include larger investment portfolio size asset allocation shifts and changes in foreign exchange exposures relative to the us dollar

the company believes that making its products trustworthy is critical to their success and has launched a companywide effort called trustworthy computing trustworthy computing has four pillars reliability security privacy and business integrity reliability means that a computer system is dependable is available when needed and performs as expected and at appropriate levels security means that a system is resilient to attack and that the confidentiality integrity and availability of both the system and its data are protected privacy means that individuals have the ability to control data about themselves and that those using such data faithfully adhere to fair information principles business integrity in this context is about being responsible to customers and helping them find appropriate solutions for their business issues addressing problems with products or services and being open in interactions with customers while the company is continuing to invest significantly in delivering new capabilities that customers ask for microsoft is making security improvements a high priority

competition 

  

the software business is intensely competitive and subject to rapid technological change as the company pursues its largest strategic initiative microsoft net the company could experience more intense competition during the transition from the traditional core businesses to its new products based on the net architecture the company continues to face movement from pcbased applications to serverbased applications or webbased application hosting services from proprietary software to open source software such as the linux operating system and from pcs to internetbased devices a number of microsoft’s most significant competitors including ibm sun microsystems oracle and aoltime warner are collaborating with one another on various initiatives directed at competing with microsoft these initiatives relate in part to efforts to move software from individual pcs to centrally managed servers which would present significant challenges to the company’s historical business model other competitive collaborative efforts include the development of new platform technologies that are intended to replicate much of the value of microsoft windows operating systems new computing form factors including nonpc information devices are gaining popularity and competing with pcs running microsoft’s software products 

microsoft faces formidable competition in these new areas and in all areas of its current business activities the rapid pace of technological change particularly in the area of internet platforms and services continually creates new opportunities for existing competitors and startups and can quickly render existing technologies less valuable global software piracy—the unlawful copying and distribution of microsoft’s copyrighted software products—deprives the company of large amounts of revenue on an annual basis

revenue 

  

the company’s revenue growth rate was 16 in fiscal 2000 10 in fiscal 2001 and 12 in fiscal 2002 revenue growth in fiscal 2002 was led by the addition of xbox video game system revenue and the strong penetration of microsoft windows xp professional and home operating systems revenue growth in fiscal 2001 was driven primarily by licensing of microsoft windows 2000 professional microsoft sql server and the other net enterprise servers revenue growth in fiscal 2000 was driven by strong licensing of microsoft windows nt workstation windows 2000 professional windows nt server windows 2000 server microsoft office 2000 and sql server

the continued adoption of microsoft’s net enterprise server offerings enterprise services revenue in fiscal 2001 was up 34 compared to fiscal 2000 and server platforms increased 10 while revenue from developer tools and services was flat in fiscal 2000 server platforms revenue growth was particularly strong led by increased adoption by customers of windows nt server and windows 2000 server revenue from server applications grew strongly in fiscal 2000 largely due to the strong success of sql server 70 while software developer tools and services revenue declined due to increased suite licensing versus standalone licenses and the lack of a release upgrade of the visual studio development system 

  

consumer software services and devices consumer software services and devices revenue was 163 billion 195 billion and 359 billion in 2000 2001 and 2002 consumer software services and devices includes the xbox video game system msn internet access msn network service pc and online games learning and productivity software mobility and embedded systems the majority of the revenue growth from fiscal 2001 stemmed from sales of the xbox video game system released in fiscal 2002 msn internet access revenue increased as a result of both a higher subscriber base and higher average revenue per subscriber due to a reduction in promotional subscriber programs revenue from msn network services increased despite a declining internet advertising market revenue from embedded systems in fiscal 2002 grew nicely however learning and productivity software revenue and pc and online games declined compared to fiscal 2001 in fiscal 2001 revenue from msn network services grew strongly despite a decline in the online advertising market msn internet access revenue also grew solidly from fiscal 2000 as a result of an increased subscriber base partially offset by a decline in the average revenue per subscriber due to a larger mix of subscribers contracted under rebate programs revenue from embedded systems grew strongly from the prior year while learning and productivity software revenue and pc and online games revenue declined reflecting softness in the overall consumer market in fiscal 2000 online revenue growth was very strong and reflected higher subscriber totals offset by lower net prices for internet access subscriptions compared to the prior year additionally strong sales of entertainment software in fiscal 2000 produced robust revenue growth in pc and online games 

  

consumer commerce investments consumer commerce investments revenue was 182 million 299 million and 242 million in 2000 2001 and 2002 consumer commerce investments include expedia inc the homeadvisor online real estate service and the carpoint online automotive service the decline in revenue compared to fiscal 2001 reflects the sale of microsoft’s majority ownership of expedia inc to usa networks inc on february 4 2002 acquisitions of travelscapecom and vacationspotcom by expedia inc and increased product offerings from expedia led to the strong revenue growth in fiscal 2001 the increased overall reach of all properties led to the strong revenue growth in fiscal 2000 

  

other other revenue which primarily includes hardware and microsoft press was 754 million 630 million and 530 million in 2000 2001 and 2002 in fiscal 2002 continued declines in the it book and consumer market led to a decline in microsoft press and hardware sales lower sales of gaming devices and other hardware peripherals as a result of weakness in the consumer market caused the decline in revenue in fiscal 2001 continued success of the company’s new hardware device offerings led to revenue growth in fiscal 2000 

  

distribution channels 

  

microsoft distributes its products primarily through the following channels oem volume licensing online services and products and distributors and retailers oem channel revenue represents license fees from original equipment manufacturers who preinstall microsoft products primarily on pcs microsoft has three major geographic sales and marketing regions the south pacific and americas region the europe middle east and africa region and the asia region sales of volume licenses and packaged software products via these channels are primarily to distributors and resellers 

oem revenue was 701 billion in 2000 786 billion in 2001 and 900 billion in 2002 in fiscal 2002 reported licenses declined compared to fiscal 2001 however a strong increase in the mix of the higher priced windows 2000 and windows xp professional licenses and healthy growth in direct and system builder oems licenses led to higher average revenue per license and contributed to the overall oem revenue growth over fiscal 2001 in fiscal 2001 while total licenses were also impacted by a slowdown in pc shipments the mix of the higher priced windows 2000 professional and windows nt workstation increased substantially resulting in higher average revenue per license a relatively low growth rate in fiscal 2000 was due to lower business pc shipment growth combined with post midyear availability of windows 2000 professional average earned revenue per license also declined in fiscal 2000 compared to the prior year due in part to a mix shift to the lowerpriced windows 98 operating system reflecting the softness in demand for business pcs and lower prices on operating systems licensed through certain oem channel sectors 

south pacific and americas region revenue was 833 billion 952 billion and 1141 billion in 2000 2001 and 2002 in fiscal 2002 the majority of the revenue growth was driven by sales of the xbox video game system released during the year as well as strong windows xp professional licensing msn subscription revenue and revenue from microsoft great plains in fiscal 2001 revenue growth was led by strong licensing of windows 2000 professional and the family of net enterprise servers particularly sql server 2000 and exchange 2000 server revenue from enterprise services and msn subscription and services also grew strongly in fiscal 2001 in fiscal 2000 office 2000 integrated suites windows 2000 server online revenue and sql server sales were the primary drivers of the revenue growth strong retail sales of hardware devices and consumer software also contributed to the growth over the prior year 

europe middle east and africa region revenue was 502 billion 486 billion and 513 billion in 2000 2001 and 2002 in fiscal 2002 the majority of the growth was a result of strong multiyear licensing revenue of windows xp home and professional operating systems and enterprise software as well as the addition of xbox video game system revenue in the second half of the year in fiscal 2001 weakening local currencies negatively impacted translated revenue compared to the prior year while revenue from windows 2000 professional and the net enterprise server family of products was very healthy in fiscal 2000 retail sales of windows operating systems and

asia region revenue was 260 billion in 2000 306 billion in 2001 and 283 billion in 2002 in fiscal 2002 asia region revenue declined most notably due to lower consumer pc shipments which hampered revenue from localized versions of microsoft office 2000 and microsoft office xp especially the office personal edition xbox video game system sales partially offset the decline in office revenue in fiscal 2001 the region’s growth rate reflected strong revenue from localized versions of microsoft office 2000 and microsoft office xp especially the office personal edition this growth was also attributable to windows 2000 professional and net server applications licensing in fiscal 2000 the region’s growth rate reflected strong performance resulting from improved local economic conditions revenue growth was also influenced by robust growth of localized versions of microsoft office 2000 especially the office personal edition sold in japan windows platform and server licensing and strong adoption of sql server 

the company’s operating results are affected by foreign exchange rates approximately 30 27 and 25 of the company’s revenue was collected in foreign currencies during 2000 2001 and 2002 since a portion of local currency revenue is hedged and much of the company’s international manufacturing costs and operating expenses are also incurred in local currencies the impact of exchange rates is partially mitigated

sales and marketing sales and marketing expense as a percentage of revenue was 180 in 2000 193 in 2001 and 191 in 2002 in fiscal 2002 sales and marketing expense as a percentage of revenue decreased due to lower relative msn customer acquisition marketing and the large relative increase associated with the onset of xbox video game system revenue in fiscal 2001 sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue increased due to higher relative headcountrelated costs higher marketing and sales expenses associated with msn the microsoft agility advertising campaign and other new sales initiatives in fiscal 2000 sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue increased due to higher relative marketing costs associated with new product releases and online marketing microsoft expects that it will increase spending on information worker server platforms and business solutions sales forces and windows client msn and home  entertainment marketing

losses on equity investees and other consists of microsoft’s share of income or loss from investments accounted for using the equity method and income or loss attributable to minority interests the decrease in losses on equity investees and other in fiscal 2002 was attributed to the divestiture of certain equity investments in fiscal 2002 the increase in losses on equity investees and other in fiscal 2001 reflects an increase in the number of such investments during the year in fiscal 2000 losses on equity investees and other decreased reflecting smaller losses from the msnbc entities

item 7 

  

the company recorded net investment incomeloss in each year as follows 

  

 

  

in fiscal 2002 otherthantemporary impairments primarily related to the company’s investment in att and other cable and telecommunication investments net gains on the sales of investments included a 125 billion gain on the sale of the company’s share of expedia interest and dividend income decreased 66 million from fiscal 2001 as a result of lower interest rates and dividend income 

in fiscal 2001 otherthantemporary impairments primarily related to cable and telecommunication investments net gains from the sales of investments in fiscal 2001 included a gain from microsoft’s investment in titus communications which was merged with jupiter telecommunications and the closing of the sale of transpoint to checkfree holdings corp interest and dividend income increased 591 million from fiscal 2000 reflecting a larger investment portfolio in fiscal year 2000 investment income increased primarily as a result of a larger investment portfolio generated by cash from operations coupled with realized gains from the sale of securities 

at june 30 2002 unrealized losses on equity and other investments of 623 million were deemed to be temporary in nature the following among other factors could result in some investments being deemed otherthantemporarily impaired in future periods changes in the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost the financial health of and business outlook for the investee including industry and sector performance changes in technology and operational and financing cash flow factors and the company’s intent and ability to hold the investment 

in connection with the definitive agreement to combine att broadband with comcast in a new company to be called att comcast corporation microsoft has agreed to exchange its att 5 convertible preferred debt securities for approximately 115 million shares of att comcast corporation it is expected that the transaction will close by december 31 2002 while it is possible that microsoft could incur a loss on this exchange transaction up to the carrying value of the att debt securities management believes that the ultimate loss if any will be significantly less as management is unable to predict whether there will be a gain or loss on the exchange no loss has been recorded related to this contingent exchange transaction as of june 30 2002 

the company’s effective tax rate for fiscal 2002 was 32 the effective tax rate for fiscal 2001 and fiscal 2000 was 33 and 34 respectively the decrease in the effective tax rate is due primarily to lower taxes on foreign earnings 

  

accounting changes 

  

effective july 1 2001 microsoft adopted sfas 141 business combinations and sfas 142 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 141 requires business combinations to be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting it also specifies the types of acquired intangible assets that are required to be recognized and reported separate from goodwill sfas 142 requires that goodwill and certain intangibles no longer be amortized but instead tested for impairment at least annually there was no impairment of goodwill upon adoption of sfas 142 goodwill amortization on a pretax basis was 234 million in fiscal 2000 and 311 million in fiscal 2001

part ii 

item 7 

  

cash flow from operations was 1451 billion for fiscal 2002 an increase of 109 billion from fiscal 2001 the increase reflects strong growth in unearned revenue cash used for financing was 457 billion in fiscal 2002 a decrease of 101 billion from the prior year the decrease reflects the repurchase of put warrants in the prior year the company repurchased 1228 million shares of common stock under its share repurchase program in fiscal 2002 compared to 890 million shares repurchased in the prior year in addition 51 million shares of common stock were acquired in fiscal 2002 under a structured stock repurchase transaction the company entered into the structured stock repurchase transaction in fiscal 2001 giving it the right to acquire 51 million of its shares in exchange for an upfront net payment of 264 million cash used for investing was 1085 billion in fiscal 2002 an increase of 211 billion from fiscal 2001 

cash flow from operations was 1342 billion in fiscal 2001 an increase of 200 billion from the prior year the increase was primarily attributable to the growth in revenue and other changes in working capital partially offset by the decrease in the stock option income tax benefit reflecting decreased stock option exercises by employees cash used for financing was 559 billion in fiscal 2001 an increase of 339 billion from the prior year the increase primarily reflects the repurchase of put warrants in fiscal 2001 compared to the sale of put warrants in the prior fiscal year as well as an increase in common stock repurchased all outstanding put warrants were either retired or exercised during fiscal 2001 during fiscal 2001 the company repurchased 890 million shares cash used for investing was 873 billion in fiscal 2001 a decrease of 658 million from the prior year in fiscal 2000 cash flow from operations was 1143 billion a decrease of 720 million from the prior year reflecting working capital changes partially offset by the increase in the stock option income tax benefit cash used for financing was 219 billion in fiscal 2000 an increase of 133 billion from the prior year reflecting an increase in common stock repurchased versus the prior year during fiscal 2000 the company repurchased 552 million shares cash used for investing was 939 billion in fiscal 2000 a decrease of 808 million from the prior year

management believes existing cash and shortterm investments together with funds generated from operations should be sufficient to meet operating requirements the company’s cash and shortterm investments are available for strategic investments mergers and acquisitions other potential largescale needs and to fund the share repurchase program microsoft has not paid cash dividends on its common stock 

  

subsequent event 

  

on july 11 2002 microsoft acquired navision as as a result of the successful close of a tender offer microsoft purchased navision’s shares for approximately 145 billion in stock and cash navision is a provider of integrated business software solutions for small and mediumsized companies 

  

application of critical accounting policies 

  

microsoft’s financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses these estimates and assumptions are affected by management’s application of accounting policies critical accounting policies for microsoft include revenue recognition impairment of investment securities accounting for research and development costs accounting for legal contingencies and accounting for income taxes 

microsoft accounts for the licensing of software in accordance with american institute of certified public accountants aicpa statement of position sop 972 software revenue recognition the application of sop 972 requires judgment including whether a software arrangement includes multiple elements and if so whether vendorspecific objective evidence vsoe of fair value exists for those elements end users receive certain elements of the company’s products over a period of time these elements include browser technologies updates and technical support the fair value of which is recognized over the product’s estimated life cycle changes to the elements in a software arrangement the ability to identify vsoe for those elements the fair value of the respective elements and changes to a product’s estimated life cycle could materially impact the amount of earned and unearned revenue judgment is also required to assess whether future releases of certain software represent new products or upgrades and enhancements to existing products 

sfas 115 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities and securities and exchange commission sec staff accounting bulletin sab 59 accounting for noncurrent marketable equity securities provide guidance on determining when an investment is otherthantemporarily impaired which also requires judgment in making this judgment microsoft evaluates among other factors the duration and extent to which the fair value of an investment is less than its cost the financial health of and business outlook for the investee including factors such as industry and sector performance changes in technology and operational and financing cash flow and the company’s intent and ability to hold the investment 

microsoft accounts for research and development costs in accordance with several accounting pronouncements including sfas 2 accounting for research and development costs and sfas 86 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold leased or other 

  

 

part ii 

item 7 

  

wise marketed sfas 86 specifies that costs incurred internally in creating a computer software product should be charged to expense when incurred as research and development until technological feasibility has been established for the product once technological feasibility is established all software costs should be capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers judgment is required in determining when the technological feasibility of a product is established microsoft has determined that technological feasibility for its products is reached shortly before the products are released to manufacturing costs incurred after technological feasibility is established are not material and accordingly the company expenses all research and development costs when incurred 

microsoft is subject to various legal proceedings and claims the outcomes of which are subject to significant uncertainty sfas 5 accounting for contingencies requires that an estimated loss from a loss contingency should be accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated disclosure of a contingency is required if there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss has been incurred the company evaluates among other factors the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss changes in these factors could materially impact the company’s financial position or its results of operations 

sfas 109 accounting for income taxes establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for the effect of income taxes the objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity’s financial statements or tax returns judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the company’s financial statements or tax returns fluctuations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact the company’s financial position or its results of operations 

  

issues and uncertainties 

  

the following issues and uncertainties among others should be considered in evaluating the company’s financial outlook 

  

challenges to the company’s business model since its inception the company’s business model has been based upon customers agreeing to pay a fee to license software developed and distributed by microsoft under this commercial software development “csd” model software developers bear the costs of converting original ideas into software products through investments in research and development offsetting these costs with the revenues received from the distribution of their products the company believes that the csd model has had substantial benefits for users of software allowing them to rely on the expertise of the company and other software developers that have powerful incentives to develop innovative software that is useful reliable and compatible with other software and hardware in recent years there has been a growing challenge to the csd model often referred to as the open source movement under the open source model software is produced by global “communities” of programmers and the resulting software and the intellectual property contained therein is licensed to end users at little or no cost the company believes that there are significant problems with the open source model the principal drawback being that no single entity is responsible for the open source software and thus users have no recourse if a product does not work properly or at all further without the market incentives associated with the csd model the company believes that the vigorous innovation and growth of the software industry over the last 25 years would not have occurred nonetheless the popularization of the open source movement continues to pose a significant challenge to the company’s business model including recent efforts by proponents of the open source model to convince governments worldwide to mandate the use of open source software in their purchase and deployment of software products to the extent the open source model gains increasing market acceptance sales of the company’s products may decline the company may have to reduce the prices it charges for its products and revenues and operating margins may consequently decline 

  

new products and services the company has made significant investments in research and development for new products services and technologies including microsoft net xbox business applications msn mobile and wireless technologies and television significant revenue from these investments may not be achieved for a number of years if at all moreover these products and services may never be profitable and even if they are profitable operating margins for these businesses are not expected to be as high as the margins historically experienced in our desktop and enterprise software and services businesses 

  

declines in demand for software if overall market demand for pcs servers and other computing devices declines significantly and consumer and corporate spending for such products declines microsoft’s revenue growth will be adversely affected additionally the company’s revenues would be unfavorably impacted if customers reduce their purchases of new software products or upgrades to existing products if such new offerings are not perceived to add significant new functionality or other value to prospective purchasers 

  

product development schedule the development of software products is a complex and timeconsuming process new products and enhancements to existing products can require long development and testing periods significant delays in new product releases or significant problems in creating new products could negatively impact the company’s revenues 

  

international operations microsoft develops and sells products throughout the world the prices of the company’s products in countries outside of the united states are generally higher than the company’s prices in the united states because of the cost incurred in localizing software for nonus markets the costs of producing and selling the company’s products in these countries also are higher pressure to globalize microsoft’s pricing structure might require that the company reduce the sales price of its software in other countries even though the costs of the software continue to be higher than in the united states unfavorable changes in trade protection laws policies and measures and other regulatory requirements affecting trade and investment unexpected changes in regulatory requirements for software social political labor or economic conditions in a specific country or region including foreign exchange rates difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations and potential adverse foreign tax consequences among other factors could also have a negative effect on the company’s business and results of operations outside of the united states 

  

 

part ii 

item 7 

  

  

intellectual property rights microsoft diligently defends its intellectual property rights but unlicensed copying and use of software represents a loss of revenue to the company while this adversely affects us revenue revenue loss is even more significant outside the united states particularly in countries where laws are less protective of intellectual property rights throughout the world microsoft actively educates consumers on the benefits of licensing genuine products and educates lawmakers on the advantages of a business climate where intellectual property rights are protected however continued efforts may not affect revenue positively and further deterioration in compliance with existing legal protections or reductions in the legal protection for intellectual property rights of software developers could adversely affect revenue 

  

taxation of extraterritorial income in august 2001 a world trade organization “wto” dispute panel determined that the extraterritorial tax “eti” provisions of the fsc repeal and extraterritorial income exclusion act of 2000 constitute an export subsidy prohibited by the wto agreement on subsidies and countervailing measures agreement the us government appealed the panel’s decision and lost its appeal on january 29 2002 the wto dispute settlement body adopted the appellate body report president bush has stated the us will bring its tax laws into compliance with the wto ruling but the administration and congress have not decided on a solution for this issue in july 2002 representative bill thomas chairman of the house ways and means committee introduced the american competitiveness and corporate accountability act of 2002 if enacted that bill would repeal the eti regime and introduce broadbased international reform the proposed reforms would not materially affect the company on august 30 2002 a wto arbitration panel determined that the european union may impose up to 404 billion per year in countermeasures if the us rules are not brought into compliance the wto decision does not repeal the eti tax benefit and it does not require the european union to impose trade sanctions so it is not possible to predict what impact the wto decision will have on future results pending final resolution of these matters if the eti exclusion is repealed and replacement legislation is not enacted the loss of tax benefit to the company could be significant 

litigation as discussed in note 19—contingencies of the notes to financial statements the company is subject to a variety of claims and lawsuits while the company believes that none of the litigation matters in which the company is currently involved will have a material adverse impact on the company’s financial position or results of operations it is possible that one or more of these matters could be resolved in a manner that would ultimately have a material adverse impact on the business of the company and could negatively impact its revenues and operating margins 

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

the company is exposed to foreign currency interest rate and equity price risks a portion of these risks is hedged but fluctuations could impact the company’s results of operations and financial position the company hedges the exposure of accounts receivable and a portion of anticipated revenue to foreign currency fluctuations primarily with option contracts the company monitors its foreign currency exposures daily to maximize the overall effectiveness of its foreign currency hedge positions principal currencies hedged include the euro japanese yen british pound and canadian dollar fixed income securities are subject to interest rate risk the portfolio is diversified and consists primarily of investment grade securities to minimize credit risk the company routinely uses options to hedge its exposure to interest rate risk in the event of a catastrophic increase in interest rates many securities held in the company’s equity and other investments portfolio are subject to price risk the company uses options to hedge its price risk on certain highly volatile equity securities 

the company uses a valueatrisk var model to estimate and quantify its market risks var is the expected loss for a given confidence level in fair value of the company’s portfolio due to adverse market movements over a defined time horizon the var model is not intended to represent actual losses in fair value but is used as a risk estimation and management tool the model used for currencies and equities is geometric brownian motion which allow incorporation of optionality of these exposures for interest rates the mean reverting geometric brownian motion is used to reflect the principle that fixedincome securities prices over time revert to maturity value 

valueatrisk is calculated by first simulating 10000 market price paths over 20 days for equities interest rates and foreign exchange rates taking into account historical correlations among the different rates and prices each resulting unique set of equities prices interest rates and foreign exchange rates is applied to substantially all individual holdings to reprice each holding the 250 th worst performance out of 10000 represents the valueatrisk over 20 days at the 975 th percentile several risk factors are not captured in the model including liquidity risk operational risk credit risk and legal risk 

a substantial amount of the company’s equity portfolio is held for strategic purposes the company attempts to hedge the value of these securities through the use of derivative contracts such as collars the company has incurred substantial impairment charges related to certain of these securities in fiscal 2002 and fiscal 2001 such impairment charges have been incurred primarily for strategic equity holdings that the company has not been able to hedge the var amounts disclosed below are not necessarily reflective of potential accounting losses as they are used as a risk management tool and reflect an estimate of potential reductions in fair value of the company’s portfolio losses in fair value over a 20day holding period can exceed the reported var by significant amounts and can also accumulate over a longer time horizon than the 20day holding period used in the var analysis 

the var numbers are shown separately for interest rate currency and equity risks these var numbers include the underlying portfolio positions and related hedges historical data is used to estimate var given reliance on historical data var is most effective in estimating risk exposures in markets in which there are no fundamental changes or shifts in market conditions an inherent limitation in var is that the distribution of past changes in market risk factors may not produce accurate predictions of future market risk 

  

 

part ii 

item 7a 8 

  

the following table sets forth the var calculations for substantially all of the company’s positions 

  

 

  

the total var for the combined risk categories is 908 million at june 30 2002 and 759 million at june 30 2001 the total var is 34 less at june 30 2002 and 19 less at june 30 2001 than the sum of the separate risk categories for each of those years in the above table due to the diversification benefit of the combination of risks the reasons for the change in risk in portfolios include larger investment portfolio size higher foreign exchange exposure due to stronger nonus currencies and asset allocation shifts

requires constant attention to computing technology trends and shifting
consumer demand and rapid product innovation  the pace of change is
accelerating as the computing needs of our customers move beyond the pc toward
intelligent devices and appliances

most of the companys software products are developed internally  the company
also purchases technology licenses intellectual property rights and oversees
thirdparty development and localization of certain products  internal
development enables microsoft to maintain closer technical control over its
products and gives the company the freedom to designate which modifications and
enhancements are most important and when they should be implemented  the
company has created a substantial body of proprietary development tools and has
evolved development methodologies for creating and enhancing its products
these tools and methodologies are also designed to simplify a products
portability among different operating systems microprocessors or computing
devices  product documentation is generally created internally

the company believes that a crucial factor in the success of a new product is
getting it to market quickly to respond to new user needs or advances in
intelligent devices pcs servers and the internet without compromising
product quality  the company strives to become informed at the earliest
possible time about changing usage patterns and hardware advances that may
affect software design  before releasing new software platforms microsoft
provides to software vendors a range of development training testing
resources and guidelines for developing applications

to best serve the needs of users around the world microsoft localizes many of
its products to reflect local languages and conventions and to improve the
quality and usability of the product in international markets  localizing a
product might require modifying the user interface altering dialog boxes and
translating text  in japanese versions for example all user messages and
documentation are in japanese with monetary references in the japanese yen
various microsoft products have been localized into more than 30 languages

during fiscal years 1999 2000 and 2001 the company spent 297 billion 377
billion and 438 billion respectively on product research and development
activities excluding funding of joint venture activity  those amounts
represented 150 164 and 173 respectively of revenue in each of those
years  the company is committed to continue high expenditures for research and
product development

competition


the software business is intensely competitive and subject to rapid
technological change  as the company pursues its largest strategic initiative
microsoft net the company could experience more intense competition during the
transition from the traditional core businesses to its new products based on the
 net platform  the company continues to face movements from pcbased
applications to serverbased applications or webbased application hosting
services from proprietary software to open source software and from pcs to
internetbased devices  a number of microsofts most significant competitors
including ibm sun microsystems oracle and aol time warner are collaborating
with one another on various initiatives directed at competing with microsoft
these initiatives relate in part to efforts to move software from individual pcs
to centrally managed servers which would present significant challenges to the
companys historical business model  other competitive collaborative efforts
include the development of new platform technologies that are intended to
replicate much of the value of microsoft windows operating systems  new
computing form factors including nonpc information devices are gaining
popularity and competing with pcs running microsofts software products

microsoft faces formidable competition in these new areas and in all areas of
its current business activity including competition from many companies much
larger than microsoft  the rapid pace of technological change particularly in
the area of internet platforms and services continually creates new
opportunities for existing competitors and startups and can quickly render
existing technologies less valuable  the company also faces relentless
competition from software pirates who unlawfully copy and distribute microsofts
copyrighted software products depriving the company of large amounts of revenue
on an annual basis

the companys competitive position may be adversely affected by one or more of
the following factors in the future particularly in view of the fast pace of
technological change in the computing industry

desktop and enterprise software and services


the companys competitors include many software application vendors such as ibm
lotus oracle apple filemaker inc sun microsystems corel qualcomm and
local application developers in europe and asia  ibm and corel have large
installed bases with their spreadsheet and word processor products
respectively and both have aggressive pricing strategies  also ibm and apple
preinstall certain of their application software products on various models of
their pcs competing directly with microsofts desktop application software
sun microsystems star office is also very aggressive with its pricing offering
a free download from the web or nominal charge for a cd  additionally web
based application hosting services provide an alternative to pcbased
applications such as microsoft office

microsofts operating system products face substantial competition from a wide
variety of companies  competitors such as ibm apple computer sun
microsystems and others are vertically integrated in both software development
and hardware manufacturing and have developed operating systems that they
preinstall on their own computers  many of these operating system software
products are also licensed to thirdparty oems for preinstallation on their
computers  microsofts operating system products compete with unixbased
operating systems from a wide range of companies including ibm hewlett
packard sun

                                      10

microsystems and others variants of unix run on a wide variety of computer
platforms and have gained increasing acceptance as desktop operating systems
with increased attention toward open source software the linux operating system
has gained increasing acceptance as well several computer manufacturers
preinstall linux on pc servers and many leading software developers have written
applications that run on linux microsoft windows operating systems are also
threatened by alternative platforms such as those based on internet browsing
software and java technology promoted by aol time warner and sun microsystems

the company competes in the business of providing enterprisewide computing
solutions with several competitors who enjoy a larger share of sales and larger
installed bases  many companies offer operating system software for mainframes
and midrange computers including ibm hewlettpackard and sun microsystems
since legacy business systems are typically supportintensive these competitors
also offer substantial support services  software developers that provide
competing server applications for pcbased distributed clientserver
environments include oracle ibm computer associates sybase and informix
there are also several software vendors who offer connectivity servers  as
mentioned above there are numerous companies and organizations that offer
internet and intranet server software which compete against the companys
business systems  additionally ibm has a large installed base of lotus notes
and ccmail both of which compete with the companys collaboration and email
products

the companys developer products compete against offerings from borland
macromedia oracle sun microsystems sybase symantec and other companies

consumer software services and devices


microsofts online services network msn faces formidable competition from aol
time warner including its compuserve unit yahoo and a vast array of web
sites and portals that offer content of all types and email instant messaging
calendaring chat and search and shopping services among other things  in
addition the ease of entry into internet services has allowed numerous web
based service companies to build significant businesses in areas such as email
electronic commerce web search engines directories and information of
numerous types  competitors include aol time warner yahoo excite lycos
infoseek altavista and many others  the companys msnbc joint ventures face
considerable competition from other 24hour cable and internet news
organizations such as cnn cnn headline news and fox news network  msnbc also
competes with traditional news media such as newspapers magazines and
broadcast tv

the companys consumer group continues to see consolidation across the various
entertainment and productivity segments in which microsoft competes
competitors include vivendi havas intuit electronic arts the learning
company infogrammes and logitech  still other competitors own branded
content such as disney and lucasarts

additionally pcbased games and the companys future xbox compete and will
compete headtohead against games created for proprietary systems such as the
nintendo gamecube and the sony playstation  game developers like electronic
arts namco midway activision konami thq to name a few are both partners
and competitors in the games software development segment

microsoft faces many competitors in the mobile devices space including palm
symbian nokia and openwave  the embedded operating system market is highly
fragmented with many competitive offerings  key competitors include wind river
and versions of embeddable linux from commercial linux vendors such as red hat
lineo and monta vista  the largest competitor remains inhouse operating
systems developed by device manufacturers  however this is changing as more
device builders opt for commercial offerings as connectivity and richer features
are required in devices

item 7  managements discussion and analysis of results of operations and
         financial condition

results of operations for 1999 2000 and 2001

microsoft develops manufactures licenses and supports a wide range of
software products for a multitude of computing devices  microsoft software
includes scalable operating systems for servers personal computers pcs and
intelligent devices server applications for clientserver environments
knowledge worker productivity applications and software development tools  the
companys online efforts include the msn network of internet products and
services and alliances with companies involved with broadband access and various
forms of digital interactivity  microsoft also licenses consumer software
programs sells hardware devices provides consulting services trains and
certifies system integrators and developers and researches and develops
advanced technologies for future software products

managements discussion and analysis contains statements that are forward
looking  these statements are based on current expectations and assumptions
that are subject to risks and uncertainties  actual results could differ
materially because of factors discussed below under issues and uncertainties

                                                                         revenue

the companys revenue growth rate was 29 in fiscal 1999 16 in fiscal 2000
and 10 in fiscal 2001  revenue growth in fiscal 2001 was driven primarily by
licensing of microsoft windows 2000 professional microsoft sql server and the
other net enterprise servers  consumer software services and devices revenue
also grew strongly  partially offsetting those items was flat revenue growth
from windows millennium edition windows me and windows 98 operating systems
reflecting the slowdown in consumer pc shipments and a higher mix of windows
2000 professional and windows nt workstation  revenue growth in fiscal 2000 was
driven by strong licensing of microsoft windows nt workstation windows 2000
professional windows nt server windows 2000 server microsoft office 2000 and
sql server  consumer software services and devices revenue also grew
strongly  partially offsetting those items was slower growth from windows
operating systems sold through the original equipment manufacturer oem channel
due to slow demand for business pcs throughout a significant portion of fiscal
2000  revenue growth in fiscal 1999 reflected the continued adoption of windows
operating systems and microsoft office  in addition the companys estimate for
future product returns was reduced by 250 million in fiscal 1999

in fiscal 1999 microsoft made two changes related to the ratable recognition of
revenue for a portion of its revenue for certain products  american institute
of certified public accountants aicpa statement of position sop 989
modification of sop 972 software revenue recognition with respect to certain
transactions requires companies to use the average sales price of each
undelivered element of software arrangements to unbundle revenue  prior
authoritative accounting guidance allowed a comparison of the total price
differential between a licensed product sold through different channels of
distribution to derive the value of undelivered elements offered to customers
acquiring product from one channel but not the other  upon adoption of this new
rule in the fourth quarter of fiscal 1999 the percentages of the total
arrangement treated as unearned decreased  this change reduced the amount of
microsoft windows and microsoft office sales treated as unearned and increased
the amount of revenue recognized upon shipment  additionally as part of the
companys long range planning process and a review of product shipment cycles
it was determined that the life cycle of windows should be extended from two
years to three years


product revenue

microsoft has four segments  desktop and enterprise software and services
consumer software services and devices consumer commerce investments and
other  the management discussion and analysis presentation of revenue differs
from that reported under the companys segment information appearing in the
notes to financial statements because reconciling items are allocated to those
segments

desktop and enterprise software and services

desktop and enterprise software and services revenue was 1784 billion 2040
billion and 2241 billion in 1999 2000 and 2001  desktop and enterprise
software and services includes desktop applications desktop platforms and
enterprise software and services

desktop applications revenue was 777 billion 930 billion and 954 billion
in 1999 2000 and 2001  desktop applications includes revenue from microsoft
office microsoft project visio client access licenses cals for windows nt
server and windows 2000 server exchange and backoffice microsoft great
plains and bcentral  in fiscal 2001 revenue from client access licenses
increased 14 reflecting strong licensing growth of windows nt server and
windows 2000 server cals  office revenue growth was flat during the year  in
fiscal 2000 and 1999 revenue growth from microsoft office integrated suites
including the premium professional small business and standard editions were
very solid

desktop platforms revenue was 674 billion 702 billion and 804 billion in
1999 2000 and 2001  desktop platforms includes revenue from windows 2000
professional windows nt workstation windows me windows 98 and other desktop
operating systems  fiscal 2001 revenue growth reflected the strong adoption of
windows 2000 professional partially offset by flat revenue growth from windows
me and windows 98 operating systems reflecting the slowdown in consumer pc
shipments and a higher mix of windows 2000 professional and windows nt
workstation  in fiscal 2000 desktop platforms revenue growth was modest due to
soft demand for business pcs during most of the year a slowdown in shipments in
anticipation of the post midyear availability of windows 2000 operating
systems and as expected a longer business migration cycle for the newest
windows operating system offerings  in fiscal 1999 windows units licensed
through the oem channel particularly windows nt workstation increased strongly
over the prior year  organizational licensing of windows nt workstation and
windows 98 also contributed to the growth

enterprise software and services revenue was 333 billion 408 billion and
483 billion in 1999 2000 and 2001  enterprise software and services
includes enterprise platforms server applications developer tools and
services and enterprise services  as a result of the continued adoption of
microsofts net enterprise server offerings in fiscal 2001 server applications
revenue increased 31 versus the prior year  enterprise services revenue
representing consulting and product support services was up 34 compared to
fiscal 2000  enterprise platforms which includes windows 2000 server and
windows nt server operating systems increased 10 while revenue from developer
tools and services was flat with the prior year  in fiscal 2000 enterprise
platforms revenue growth was particularly strong led by increased adoption by
customers of windows nt server and windows 2000 server  revenue from server
applications grew strongly largely due to the strong success of sql server 70
software developer tools and services revenue declined due to increased suite
licensing versus standalone licenses and the lack of a release upgrade of the
visual studio development system  in fiscal 1999 the revenue growth rate for
windows nt server was healthy  revenue from server applications grew strongly
reflecting in part the release of sql server 70  the visual studio 60
development system drove healthy developer tools and services revenue growth
consulting services revenue rose substantially

consumer software services and devices

consumer software services and devices revenue was 119 billion 163
billion and 195 billion in 1999 2000 and 2001  consumer software
services and devices includes msn internet access msn network service webtv
internet access and services pc and online games learning and productivity
software mobile and wireless devices and embedded systems  in fiscal 2001
revenue from msn network services grew strongly in light of the decline in the
online advertising market  msn internet access revenue also grew solidly as a
result of an increased subscriber base partially offset by a decline in the
average revenue per subscriber due to a larger mix of subscribers contracted
under rebate programs  revenue from embedded systems grew strongly from the
prior year while learning and productivity software revenue and pc and online
games revenue declined reflecting softness in the overall consumer market  in
fiscal 2000 online revenue growth was very strong and reflected higher
subscriber totals offset by lower net prices for internet access subscriptions
compared to the prior year  additionally strong sellthrough of entertainment
software produced robust revenue growth  in fiscal 1999 online advertising
revenue rose substantially and internet access revenue increased moderately

                                      19

consumer commerce investments

consumer commerce investments revenue was 62 million 182 million and 299
million in 1999 2000 and 2001  consumer commerce investments include expedia
inc the homeadvisor online real estate service and the carpoint online
automotive service  acquisitions of travelscapecom and vacationspotcom by
expedia inc and increased product offerings from expedia led to the strong
revenue growth in fiscal 2001  the increased overall reach of all properties
led to the strong revenue growth in fiscal 2000 and 1999

on july 16 2001 usa networks inc usa announced an agreement to acquire a
controlling interest in expedia through the purchase of up to 375 million
shares approximately 75 of the current outstanding shares  if holders of more
than 375 million expedia shares elect to sell their shares to usa there will
be a pro rata reduction among all electing shareholders  microsoft has agreed
to transfer all of its 337 million shares and warrants subject to proration
it is expected that the transaction will close by december 31 2001

other

other revenue was 653 million 754 million and 630 million in 1999 2000
and 2001  other primarily includes hardware and microsoft press  lower sales
of gaming devices and other hardware peripherals as a result of weakness in the
consumer market caused the decline in revenue in fiscal 2001  continued success
of the companys new hardware device offerings led to the revenue growth in
fiscal 2000  revenue from hardware devices and microsoft press was relatively
flat in fiscal 1999

distribution channels

microsoft distributes its products primarily through oem licenses
organizational licenses online services and products and retail packaged
products  oem channel revenue represents license fees from original equipment
manufacturers who preinstall microsoft products primarily on pcs  microsoft
has three major geographic sales and marketing regions the south pacific and
americas region the europe middle east and africa region and the asia
region  sales of organizational licenses and packaged products via these
channels are primarily to and through distributors and resellers

oem revenue was 640 billion in 1999 701 billion in 2000 and 786 billion
in 2001  although total licenses were impacted by a slowdown in pc shipments in
fiscal 2001 the mix of the higher priced windows 2000 professional and windows
nt workstation in the oem channel increased substantially resulting in higher
average revenue per license  the relatively low growth rate in fiscal 2000 was
due to lower business pc shipment growth especially as a result of the soft
demand for business pcs and component shortages for part of the year  these
issues combined with post midyear availability of windows 2000 professional
resulted in lower revenue growth  average earned revenue per license also
declined compared to the prior year due in part to a mix shift to the lower
priced windows 98 operating system reflecting the softness in demand for
business pcs and lower prices on operating systems licensed through certain oem
channel sectors  in fiscal 1999 pc shipment growth coupled with an increased
penetration of higher value 32bit operating systems drove the oem revenue
increases

south pacific and americas region revenue was 725 billion 833 billion and
952 billion in 1999 2000 and 2001  in fiscal 2001 revenue growth
principally in the united states was led by strong licensing of windows 2000
professional and the family of net enterprise servers particularly sql server
2000 and exchange 2000 server  revenue from enterprise services and msn
subscription and services grew strongly  in fiscal 2000 office 2000 integrated
suites windows 2000 server online revenue and sql server sales were the
primary drivers of the revenue growth  strong retail sales of hardware devices
and consumer software also contributed to the growth over the prior year
revenue growth was particularly strong in latin america and australia moderate
in canada and modest in the united states  in fiscal 1999 server
applications windows nt server windows nt workstation and microsoft office
all exhibited solid yearoveryear growth rates  organizational licensing
activity was strong  revenue growth was solid in the united states and moderate
in latin america and the south pacific

europe middle east and africa region revenue was 433 billion 502 billion
and 486 billion in 1999 2000 and 2001  in fiscal 2001 weakening local
currencies negatively impacted translated revenue compared to the prior year
revenue in the region would have increased 6 if foreign exchange rates were
constant with those of the prior year  revenue from windows 2000 professional
and the net enterprise server family of products was very healthy  in fiscal
2000 retail sales of windows operating systems and office licensing produced
moderate growth in the region  growth from sql server licensing new

                                      20

hardware device offerings and entertainment software was especially strong
revenue growth measured in constant dollars was very healthy in germany and
italy robust in the middle east and low in the united kingdom in fiscal 1999
all major products grew strongly over the prior year revenue growth was solid
in the united kingdom germany and france and was particularly high in sweden
the netherlands and spain

asia region revenue was 178 billion in 1999 260 billion in 2000 and 306
billion in 2001  in fiscal 2001 the regions growth rate reflected strong
revenue from localized versions of microsoft office 2000 and microsoft office
xp especially the office personal suite  the growth was also attributable to
windows 2000 professional and net server applications licensing  revenue
growth was particularly strong in korea and the greater china region resulting
from advantageous economic conditions as well as successful antipiracy efforts
in fiscal 2000 the regions growth rate reflected strong performance resulting
from improved local economic conditions  revenue growth was also influenced by
robust growth of localized versions of microsoft office 2000 especially the
office personal edition sold in japan windows platform and server licensing
and strong adoption of sql server  revenue grew strongly in nearly all
countries in the asia region  in fiscal 1999 japan taiwan china hong kong
and southeast asia had moderate revenue growth while revenue grew very strongly
in korea

the companys operating results are affected by foreign exchange rates
approximately 29 30 and 27 of the companys revenue was collected in
foreign currencies during 1999 2000 and 2001  since a portion of local
currency revenue is hedged and much of the companys international manufacturing
costs and operating expenses are also incurred in local currencies the impact
of exchange rates is partially mitigated

                                                              operating expenses

cost of revenue

cost of revenue as a percent of revenue was 143 in 1999 131 in 2000 and
137 in 2001  in fiscal 2001 higher support and service costs associated with
the msn internet access and msn network services were partially offset by the
lower relative costs associated with organizational licensing and the drop in
the mix of packaged product versus the prior year  cost of revenue in fiscal
2000 reflected lower costs associated with webtv networks operations partially
offset by the growth in hardware peripherals costs  cost of revenue as a
percentage of revenue decreased in fiscal 1999 primarily due to the trend in mix
shift to oem and organizational licenses  additionally cost of revenue in 1999
was positively impacted by a reduction in estimates of obsolete inventory and
other manufacturing costs of 67 million

research and development

development rd  in fiscal 2001 the increase in rd expense was the result
of higher headcountrelated costs and investments in new product initiatives

costs  the increase in fiscal 1999 reflected higher development headcount
related costs offset by lower infrastructure and thirdparty development costs

losses on equity investees and other incorporates microsofts share of income or
loss from the msnbc entities avanade wireless knowledge starband
communications and other investments accounted for using the equity method
the increase in losses on equity investees and other in fiscal 2001 reflects an
increase in the number of such investments during the year  in fiscal 2000 and
1999 losses on equity investees decreased reflecting smaller losses from the
msnbc entities

in fiscal 2001 the company reported an investment loss of 36 million a
decrease in investment income of 336 billion versus fiscal 2000  net
recognized losses were 222 billion in fiscal 2001 reflecting 480 billion in
impairments of certain investments primarily in the cable and telecommunication
industries and 592 million of net losses attributable to derivative
instruments  these losses were partially offset by higher net gains from the
sales of investments including a gain from microsofts investment in titus
communications which was merged with jupiter telecommunications and the
closing of the sale of transpoint to checkfree holdings corp  interest and
dividend income increased 591 million from the prior year reflecting a larger
investment portfolio  in fiscal years 2000 and 1999 investment income
increased primarily as a result of a larger investment portfolio generated by
cash from operations coupled with realized gains from the sale of securities

fiscal 2000 was 34  excluding the impact of the gain on the sale of softimage

                                                               accounting change

effective july 1 2000 microsoft adopted statement of financial accounting
standards sfas 133 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging
activities which establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative
instruments including certain derivative instruments embedded in other
contracts and for hedging activities  all derivatives whether designated in
hedging relationships or not are required to be recorded on the balance sheet
at fair value  if the derivative is designated as a fair value hedge the
changes in the fair value of the derivative and the hedged item are recognized
in earnings  if the derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge changes in
the fair value of the derivative are recorded in other comprehensive income
oci and are recognized in the income statement when the hedged item affects
earnings


the adoption of sfas 133 resulted in a cumulative pretax reduction to income of
560 million 375 million aftertax and a cumulative pretax reduction to oci
of 112 million 75 million aftertax  the reduction to income was mostly
attributable to a loss of approximately 300 million reclassified from oci for
the time value of options and a loss of approximately 250 million reclassified
from oci for derivatives not designated as hedging instruments  the reduction
to oci was mostly attributable to losses of approximately 670 million on cash
flow hedges offset by the reclassifications out of oci of the approximately 300
million loss for the time value of options and the approximately 250 million
loss for derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments

financial condition

diversified among industries and individual issuers  microsofts investments
are generally liquid and investment grade  the portfolio is invested
predominantly in us dollar denominated securities but also includes foreign
currency positions in order to diversify financial risk  the portfolio is
primarily invested in shortterm securities to minimize interest rate risk and
facilitate rapid deployment for immediate cash needs

cash flow from operations was 1342 billion in fiscal 2001 an increase of
200 billion from the prior year  the increase was primarily attributable to
the growth in revenue and other changes in working capital partially offset by
the decrease in the stock option income tax benefit reflecting decreased stock
option exercises by employees  cash used for financing was 559 billion in
fiscal 2001 an increase of 339 billion from the prior year  the increase
primarily reflects the repurchase of put warrants in fiscal 2001 compared to
the sale of put warrants in the prior fiscal year as well as an increase in
common stock repurchased  all outstanding put warrants were either retired or
exercised during fiscal 2001  during fiscal

million from the prior year reflecting working capital changes partially offset

year reflecting an increase in common stock repurchased versus the prior year

billion from the prior year reflecting the growth in the investment portfolio

microsoft has no material longterm debt  stockholders equity at june 30 2001
was 4729 billion  microsoft will continue to invest in sales marketing and
product support infrastructure  additionally research and development
activities will include investments in existing and advanced areas of
technology including using cash to acquire technology  additions to property
and equipment will continue including new facilities and computer systems for
rd sales and marketing support and administrative staff  commitments for
constructing new buildings were 181 million on june 30 2001  cash will also
be used for strategic opportunities

in addition cash will be used to repurchase common stock to provide shares for
employee stock option and purchase plans  since fiscal 1990 microsoft has
repurchased 854 million common shares while 212 billion shares were issued
under the companys employee stock option and purchase plans  the market value
of all outstanding stock options was 66 billion as of june 30 2001  during

exchangeable preferred stock  the companys convertible preferred stock matured
on december 15 1999  each preferred share was converted into 11273 common
shares

management believes existing cash and shortterm investments together with funds
generated from operations should be sufficient to meet operating requirements
the companys cash and shortterm investments are available for strategic
investments mergers and acquisitions and other potential largescale needs and
to fund the share repurchase program  microsoft has not paid cash dividends on
its common stock

recently issued accounting standards

in june 2001 the financial accounting standards board issued sfas 141 business
combinations and sfas 142 goodwill and other intangible assets  sfas 141
requires business combinations initiated after june 30 2001 to be accounted for
using the purchase method of accounting  it also specifies the types of
acquired intangible assets that are required to be recognized and reported
separately from goodwill  sfas 142 will require that goodwill and certain
intangibles no longer be amortized but instead tested for impairment at least
annually  sfas 142 is required to be applied starting with fiscal years
beginning after december 15 2001 with early application permitted in certain
circumstances  the company plans to early adopt sfas 142 in fiscal 2002 and
does not expect any impairment of goodwill upon adoption  goodwill amortization
was approximately 300 million in fiscal 2001 and approximately 225 million in
fiscal 2000

issues and uncertainties

while microsoft management is optimistic about the companys longterm
prospects the following issues and uncertainties among others should be
considered in evaluating its growth outlook

rapid technological change and competition
rapid change uncertainty due to new and emerging technologies and fierce
competition characterize the software industry which means that microsofts
market position is always at risk  microsofts ability to maintain its current
market share may depend upon the companys ability to satisfy customer
requirements enhance existing products develop and introduce new products and
achieve market acceptance of such products  this process grows more challenging
as the pace of change continues to accelerate  open source

                                      23
page

software new computing devices new microprocessor architectures the internet
and webbased computing models are among the competitive challenges the company
must meet if microsoft does not successfully identify new product opportunities
and develop and bring new products to market in a timely and costefficient
manner the companys business growth will suffer and demand for its products
will decrease

future initiatives

the company plans to continue to make significant investments in software
research and development including microsoft net hailstorm xbox wireless
technologies digital devices television and small business  it is
anticipated that these investments in research and development will increase
over historical spending levels  significant revenue from these product
opportunities may not be achieved for a number of years if at all

pc growth rates

the nature of the pc marketplace is changing in ways that may reduce microsofts
software sales and revenue growth  overall market demand for pcs can
significantly impact microsofts revenue growth  recently manufacturers have
sought to reach more consumers by developing and producing lower cost pcs  pcs
that come without preinstalled software or contain software with reduced
functionality  in addition to the influx of lowcost pcs a market for handheld
computing and communication devices has developed  while these devices are not
as powerful or versatile as pcs they threaten to erode sales growth in the
market for pcs with preinstalled software  this may affect microsofts revenue
growth because manufacturers may choose not to install microsoft software in
these lowcost pcs or consumers may purchase alternative intelligent devices
that do not use microsoft software  these lowerpriced devices require
microsoft to provide lowerpriced software with a subset of the original
functionality  as a result the company may generate less revenue from the sale
of software produced for these devices than from the sale of software for pcs

product development

the software industry is inherently complex  new products and product
enhancements can require long development and testing periods  significant
delays in new product releases or significant problems in creating new products
could damage microsofts business  the company anticipates that windows xp and
xbox will be released in fiscal 2002  delays in either product may adversely
affect revenue and net income

prices

the competitive factors described above may require microsoft to lower product
prices to meet competition reducing the companys revenue and net income

earnings process

an increasingly higher percentage of the companys revenue is subject to ratable
recognition which impacts the timing of revenue and earnings recognition
ratable revenue recognition may be required for additional products depending
on specific license terms and conditions  also maintenance and new
subscription programs are increasing in popularity

employee compensation

microsoft employees currently receive salaries incentive bonuses other
benefits and stock options  new government regulations poor stock price
performance or other factors could diminish the value of the option program to
current and prospective employees and require the company to pay higher salaries
and other cash compensation

international operations

microsoft develops and sells products throughout the world  the prices of the
companys products in countries outside of the united states are generally
higher than the companys prices in the united states because of the cost
incurred in localizing software for nonus markets  the costs of producing
and selling the companys products in these countries are also higher  pressure
to globalize microsofts pricing structure might require that the company reduce
the sales price of its software in other countries even though the costs of the
software continue to be higher than in the united states  unfavorable changes
in software piracy trade protection laws policies and measures and other
regulatory requirements affecting trade and investment unexpected changes in
regulatory requirements for software social political labor or economic
conditions in a specific country or region difficulties in staffing and
managing foreign

                                      24
page

operations and potential adverse foreign tax consequences among other factors
could also have an impact on the companys business and results of operations
outside of the united states

intellectual property rights

microsoft diligently defends its intellectual property rights but unlicensed
copying of software represents a loss of revenue to the company  while this
adversely affects us revenue revenue loss is even more significant outside of
the united states particularly in countries where laws are less protective of
intellectual property rights  throughout the world microsoft actively educates
consumers on the benefits of licensing genuine products and educates lawmakers
on the advantages of a business climate where intellectual property rights are
protected  however continued efforts may not affect revenue positively

litigation

litigation regarding intellectual property rights patents and copyrights
occurs in the software industry  in addition there are government regulation
and investigation risks along with other general corporate legal risks  the
company is a defendant in a lawsuit filed by the antitrust division of the us
department of justice and a group of eighteen state attorneys general alleging
violations of the sherman act and various state antitrust laws  after the
trial the district court entered findings of fact and conclusions of law
stating that microsoft had violated sections 1 and 2 of the sherman act and
various state antitrust laws  a judgment was entered on june 7 2000 ordering
among other things the breakup of microsoft into two companies  the judgment
was stayed pending an appeal  on june 28 2001 the us court of appeals for
the district of columbia circuit affirmed in part reversed in part and vacated
the judgment in its entirety and remanded the case to the district court for a
new trial on one section 1 claim and for entry of a new judgment consistent with
its ruling  in its ruling the court of appeals substantially narrowed the
bases of liability found by the district court but affirmed some of the
district courts conclusions that microsoft had violated section 2  on
september 6 2001 the plaintiffs announced that on remand they will not ask the
court to break microsoft up that they will seek imposition of conduct remedies
and that they will not retry the one section 1 claim returned to the district
court by the court of appeals  on august 7 2001 microsoft petitioned the
supreme court for a writ of certiorari to review the appellate courts ruling
concerning its disqualification of the district court judge  microsoft may
petition the supreme court to review other aspects of the appellate courts
decision after final judgment is entered  in response to the court of appeals
decision microsoft has modified the terms of its agreements with computer
manufacturers to permit them to remove internet explorer icons from windows when
the manufacturer wants to promote an alternative browser and modifying other
provisions of the agreements  while the company cannot predict with certainty
the final outcome of this matter its resolution may result in additional
changes to the companys business practices and could affect how the company
develops and markets new products and services  in addition while the court of
appeals ruling vacated the remedies portion of the judgment in its entirety it
is possible the district court could enter a new judgment providing for certain
remedies that would have a material adverse effect on the company if the company
cannot obtain relief from such provisions on appeal

a large number of antitrust class action lawsuits have been initiated against
microsoft these cases allege that microsoft has competed unfairly and
unlawfully monopolized alleged markets for operating systems and certain
software applications and seek to recover alleged overcharges that the
complaints contend microsoft charged for these products although microsoft
believes the claims are without merit and is vigorously defending the cases the
company cannot predict with certainty the outcome of these lawsuits

future growth rate

the revenue growth rate in 2002 may not approach the level attained in prior
years because of the fixed nature of a significant portion of operating
expenses coupled with the possibility of slower revenue growth operating
margins in 2002 may decrease from those in 2001 in addition with the
anticipated introduction of xbox in fiscal 2002 cost of revenue as a percentage
of revenue may increase versus prior years



item 7a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

the company is exposed to foreign currency interest rate and securities price
risks  a portion of these risks is hedged but fluctuations could impact the
companys results of operations and financial position

                                      25
page

the company hedges the exposure of accounts receivable and a portion of
anticipated revenue to foreign currency fluctuations primarily with option
contracts the company monitors its foreign currency exposures daily to maximize
the overall effectiveness of its foreign currency hedge positions principal
currencies hedged include the euro japanese yen british pound and canadian
dollar fixed income securities are subject to interest rate risk the portfolio
is diversified and consists primarily of investment grade securities to minimize
credit risk the company routinely uses options to hedge its exposure to
interest rate risk in the event of a catastrophic increase in interest rates
many securities held in the companys equity and other investments portfolio are
subject to price risk the company uses options to hedge its price risk on
certain highly volatile equity securities

the company uses a valueatrisk var model to estimate and quantify its market
risks  the var model is not intended to represent actual losses in fair value
but is used as a risk estimation and management tool  assumptions applied to
the var model at june 30 2000 and june 30 2001 include the following normal
market conditions monte carlo modeling with 10000 simulated market price
paths a 975 confidence interval and a 20day estimated loss in fair value
for each market risk category  accordingly 975 of the time the estimated 20
day loss in fair value would be nominal for foreign currency denominated
investments and accounts receivable at june 30 2000 and june 30 2001 and
would not exceed 211 million and 363 million at june 30 2000 and june 30
2001 for interestsensitive investments or 102 billion and 520 million at
june 30 2000 and june 30 2001 for equity securities
