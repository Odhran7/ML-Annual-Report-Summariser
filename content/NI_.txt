nisource inc is an energy holding company under the public utility holding company act of 2005 whose primary subsidiaries are fully regulated natural gas and electric utility companies serving approximately 37 million customers in six states nisource is the successor to an indiana corporation organized in 1987 under the name of nipsco industries inc which changed its name to nisource on april 14 1999 

nisource’s principal subsidiaries include nisource gas distribution group inc a natural gas distribution holding company and nipsco a gas and electric company nisource derives substantially all of its revenues and earnings from the operating results of these rateregulated businesses 

nisource has two reportable segments gas distribution operations and electric operations the following is a summary of the business for each reporting segment refer to item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and note 23 segments of business in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information related to each segment 

gas distribution operations 

our natural gas distribution operations serve approximately 32 million customers in six states through our whollyowned subsidiary nisource gas distribution group inc we own five distribution subsidiaries that provide natural gas to approximately 24 million residential commercial and industrial customers in ohio pennsylvania virginia kentucky and maryland additionally we distribute natural gas to approximately 853000 customers in northern indiana through our whollyowned subsidiary nipsco we operate approximately 54600 miles of distribution main pipeline plus the associated individual customer service lines and 1000 miles of transmission main pipeline located in our service areas described below throughout our service areas we also have gate stations and other operations support facilities 

we earn revenues that are approved by the jurisdictions in which we operate for the delivery of natural gas to our customers the approved revenues include provisions to adjust billings for fluctuations in the cost of natural gas revenues are adjusted for differences between actual costs subject to reconciliation and the amounts billed in current rates 

electric operations 

we generate transmit and distribute electricity through our subsidiary nipsco to approximately 483000 customers in 20 counties in the northern part of indiana and also engage in wholesale electric and transmission transactions we own and operate sources of generation as well as source power through ppas we continue to transition our generation portfolio to primarily renewable sources during 2021 we operated rosewater for the full year and indiana crossroads wind went into service during december 2021 we also purchased energy generated from renewable sources through ppas in october 2021 nipsco completed the retirement of two coalburning units with installed capacity of approximately 903 mw at schahfer generating station located in wheatfield in as of december 31 2021 we have multiple ppas that provide 500 mw of capacity with contracts expiring between 2024 and 2040 see below for information on our owned operating facilities

nipsco participates in the miso transmission service and wholesale energy market miso is a nonprofit organization created in compliance with ferc regulations to improve the flow of electricity in the regional marketplace and to enhance electric reliability additionally miso is responsible for managing energy markets transmission constraints and the dayahead realtime financial transmission rights and ancillary markets nipsco transferred functional control of its electric transmission assets to miso and transmission service for nipsco occurs under the miso open access transmission tariff nipsco units are dispatched by miso which takes into account economics reliability of the miso system and unit availability during the year ended december 31 2021 nipsco units were dispatched to meet 4787 of its load requirements and nipsco purchased 5213 from the miso market 

business strategy 

we focus our business strategy on providing safe and reliable service through our core rateregulated assetbased utilities which generate substantially all of our operating income our utilities continue to move forward on core safety infrastructure and environmental investment programs supported by complementary regulatory and customer initiatives across all six states in which we operate our goal is to develop strategies that benefit all stakeholders as we i embark on longterm infrastructure investment and safety programs to better serve our customers ii align our tariff structures with our cost structure and iii address changing customer conservation patterns these strategies focus on improving safety and reliability enhancing customer service ensuring customer affordability and reducing emissions while generating sustainable returns 

the safety of our customers communities and employees has been and remains our top priority sms is an established operating model within nisource with the continued support and advice from our quality review board a panel of third parties with safety operations expertise engaged by management to advise on safety matters we are continuing to mature our sms processes capabilities and talent as we collaborate within and across industries to enhance safety and reduce operational risk additionally we continue to pursue regulatory and legislative initiatives that will allow residential customers not currently on our system to obtain gas service in a cost effective manner 

in november 2021 we submitted our 2021 integrated resource plan with the iurc the plan calls for the replacement of the retiring units with a diverse portfolio of resources including demand side management resources incremental solar standalone energy storage and upgrades to existing facilities at the sugar creek generating station among other steps refer to item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” for further discussion of these plans 

the nisource political action committee nipac provides our employees a voice in the political process nipac is a voluntary employee and director driven and funded political action committee and nipac makes bipartisan political contributions to local state and federal candidates where permitted and in accordance with established guidelines consistent with our commitments and our approach to engagement the nipac leadership committee members evaluate candidates for support on issues important to our business 

natural gas competition  open access to natural gas supplies over interstate pipelines and the deregulation of the gas supply has led to tremendous change in the energy markets ldc customers can purchase gas directly from producers and marketers in an open competitive market this separation or “unbundling” of the transportation and other services offered by ldcs allows customers to purchase the commodity independent of services provided by ldcs ldcs continue to purchase gas and recover the associated costs from their customers certain of our gas distribution operations’ subsidiaries are involved in programs that provide our residential and commercial customers the opportunity to purchase their natural gas requirements from third parties and use our gas distribution operations’ subsidiaries for transportation services as of december 31 2021 262 of our residential customers and 354 of our commercial customers participated in such programs 

gas distribution operations competes with i investorowned municipal and cooperative electric utilities throughout its service areas ii other regulated and unregulated natural gas intra and interstate pipelines and iii other alternate fuels such as propane and fuel oil gas distribution operations continues to be a strong competitor in the energy market as a result of strong customer preference for natural gas competition with providers of electricity has traditionally been the strongest in the residential and commercial markets of kentucky southern ohio central pennsylvania and western virginia due to comparatively low electric rates 

electric competition  indiana electric utilities generally have exclusive service areas under indiana regulations and retail electric customers in indiana do not have the ability to choose their electric supplier nipsco faces nonutility competition from other energy sources such as selfgeneration by large industrial customers and other distributed energy sources

seasonality 

a significant portion of our operations are subject to seasonal fluctuations in sales during the heating and cooling seasons revenues from gas and electric sales respectively are more significant than in other months the heating season is primarily from november through march and the cooling season is primarily from june through september 

rate case actions 

the following table describes current rate case actions as applicable in each of our jurisdictions net of tracker impacts see cost recovery and trackers below for further detail on trackers 



1 no approved roe is identified for this matter since the approved revenue increase is the result of a black box settlement under which parties agree upon the amount of increase without specifying ratemaking elements to establish the companys revenue requirement pursuant to the settlement for purposes of calculating its dsic columbia of pennsylvania shall use the equity return rate for gas utilities contained in the pennsylvania commission’s most recent quarterly report on the earnings of jurisdictional utilities including quarterly updates thereto 

2 the approved roe for natural gas capital riders  eg smrp is 9275 

3 columbia of virginias rate case resulted in a black box settlement representing a settlement to a specific revenue increase but not a specified roe the settlement provides use of a 970 roe for future save filings 

4 proposed new rates would be implemented in 2 steps with implementation of step 1 rates to be effective in september 2022 and step 2 rates to be effective in march 2023 

covid19 regulatory deferrals 

in addition to the cost deferred to a regulatory asset as noted in note 9 regulatory matters in the notes to consolidated financial statements certain states have permitted us to track lost late and disconnect fee revenues due to the pandemic while these costs do not qualify as regulatory assets under asc 980 we will consider seeking recovery of these costs in future regulatory proceedings 

competition and changes in the regulatory environment 

the regulatory frameworks applicable to our operations including environmental regulations at both the state and federal levels continue to evolve these changes have had and will continue to have an impact on our operations structure and profitability management continually seeks new ways to be more competitive and profitable in this environment we believe we are in all material respects in compliance with such laws and regulations and do not expect continued compliance to have a material impact on our capital expenditures earnings or competitive position we continue to monitor existing and pending laws and regulations and the impact of regulatory changes cannot be predicted with certainty refer to note 19e environmental matters in the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information regarding environmental regulations that are applicable to our operations 

the gas distribution operations utilities have pursued nontraditional revenue sources within the evolving natural gas marketplace these efforts include i the sale of products and services upstream of the companies’ service territory ii the sale of products and services in the companies’ service territories and iii gas supply cost incentive mechanisms for service to their 

item 1 business 

n i s ource i nc  

core markets the upstream products are made up of transactions that occur between an individual gas distribution operations utility and a buyer for the sales of unbundled or rebundled gas supply and capacity the onsystem services are offered by us to customers and include products such as the transportation and balancing of gas on the gas distribution operations utilitys system the incentive mechanisms give the gas distribution operations utilities an opportunity to share in the savings created from such situations as gas purchase prices paid below an agreed upon benchmark and their ability to reduce pipeline capacity charges with their customers 

we recognize that energy efficiency reduces emissions conserves natural resources and saves our customers money our gas distribution companies offers programs such as energy efficiency upgrades home checkups and weatherization services the increased efficiency of natural gas appliances and improvements in home building codes and standards contributes to a longterm trend of declining average use per customer while we are looking to expand offerings so the energy efficiency programs can benefit as many customers as possible our gas distribution operations have pursued changes in rate design to more effectively match recoveries with costs incurred columbia of ohio has adopted a straight fixed variable rate design that closely links the recovery of fixed costs with fixed charges columbia of maryland and columbia of virginia have regulatory approval for weather and revenue normalization adjustments for certain customer classes which adjust monthly revenues that exceed or fall short of approved levels columbia of pennsylvania continues to operate its pilot residential weather normalization adjustment and also has a fixed customer charge this weather normalization adjustment only adjusts revenues when actual weather compared to normal varies by more than 3 columbia of kentucky incorporates a weather normalization adjustment for certain customer classes and also has a fixed customer charge in a prior gas base rate proceeding nipsco implemented a higher fixed customer charge for residential and small customer classes moving toward recovering more of its fixed costs through a fixed recovery charge but has no weather or usage protection mechanism 

while increased efficiency of electric appliances and improvements in home building codes and standards has similarly impacted the average use per electric customer in recent years nipsco expects future growth in per customer usage as a result of increasing electric applications further growth is anticipated as electric vehicles become more prevalent these ongoing changes in use of electricity will likely lead to development of innovative rate designs and nipsco will continue efforts to design rates that increase the certainty of recovery of fixed costs 

cost recovery and trackers comparability of our line item operating results is impacted by regulatory trackers that allow for the recovery in rates of certain costs such as those described below increases in the expenses that are subject to approved regulatory tracker mechanisms generally lead to increased regulatory assets which ultimately result in a corresponding increase in operating revenues and therefore have essentially no impact on total operating income results certain approved regulatory tracker mechanisms allow for abbreviated regulatory proceedings in order for the operating companies to quickly implement revised rates and recover associated costs 

a portion of the gas distribution revenue is related to the recovery of gas costs the review and recovery of which occurs through standard regulatory proceedings all states in our operating area require periodic review of actual gas procurement activity to determine prudence and confirm the recovery of prudently incurred energy commodity costs supplied to customers 

a portion of the electric operations revenue is related to the recovery of fuel costs to generate power and the fuel costs related to purchased power these costs are recovered through a fac which is updated quarterly to reflect actual costs incurred to supply electricity to customers 

human capital 

human capital management governance and organizational practices  the compensation and human capital committee of our board of directors the board is primarily responsible for assisting the board in overseeing our human capital management practices in october 2021 the board renamed the compensation committee the “compensation and human capital committee” and clarified the committee’s responsibilities in its charter to include reviewing our human capital management function and programs including related procedures programs policies and practices and to make recommendations to management with respect to equal employment opportunity and diversity equity and inclusion initiatives employee engagement and corporate culture and talent management our board also reviews human capital management matters including talent strategy employee engagement and culture earlier in 2021 we hired a new senior vice president and chief human resources officer and a new vice president and chief diversity officer to lead these initiatives

operational risks 

we may not be able to execute our business plan or growth strategy including utility infrastructure investments 

business or regulatory conditions may result in us not being able to execute our business plan or growth strategy including identified planned and other utility infrastructure investments which includes investments related to natural gas pipeline modernization and investments related to our renewable energy projects and the buildtransfer execution goals within our business plan our “nisource next” initiative a comprehensive program designed to identify longterm sustainable capability enhancements and cost optimization improvements has increased the volume and pace of change and may not be effective as it continues our customer and regulatory initiatives may not achieve planned results utility infrastructure investments may not materialize may cease to be achievable or economically viable and may not be successfully completed natural gas may cease to be viewed as an economically and environmentally attractive fuel certain environmental activist groups investors and governmental entities continue to oppose natural gas delivery and infrastructure investments because of perceived environmental impacts associated with the natural gas supply chain and end use energy conservation energy efficiency distributed generation energy storage policies favoring electric heat over gas heat and other factors may reduce demand for natural gas and electricity in addition we consider acquisitions or dispositions of assets or businesses joint ventures and mergers from time to time as we execute on our business plan and growth strategy any of these circumstances could adversely affect our results of operations and growth prospects even if our business plan and growth strategy are executed there is still risk of among other things human error in maintenance installation or operations shortages or delays in obtaining equipment and performance below expected levels in addition to the other risks discussed in this section we are currently experiencing and expect to continue to experience supply chain challenges impacting our ability to obtain materials for our gas and electric projects risks to our capital projects is described in a separate risk factor below 

item 1a risk factors 

n i s ource i nc  

our gas distribution and transmission activities as well as generation transmission and distribution of electricity involve a variety of inherent hazards and operating risks including potential public safety risks 

our gas distribution and transmission activities as well as generation transmission and distribution of electricity involve a variety of inherent hazards and operating risks including but not limited to gas leaks and overpressurization downed power lines stray electrical voltage excavation or vehicular damage to our infrastructure outages environmental spills mechanical problems and other incidents which could cause substantial financial losses as demonstrated in part by the greater lawrence incident we also have distribution propane assets that involve similar risks in addition these hazards and risks have resulted and may in the future result in serious injury or loss of life to employees andor the general public significant damage to property environmental pollution impairment of our operations adverse regulatory rulings and reputational harm which in turn could lead to substantial losses for nisource and its stockholders the location of pipeline facilities including regulator stations liquefied natural gas and underground storage or generation transmission substation and distribution facilities near populated areas including residential areas commercial business centers and industrial sites could increase the level of damages resulting from such incidents as with the greater lawrence incident certain incidents have subjected and may in the future subject us to litigation or administrative or other legal proceedings from time to time both civil and criminal which could result in substantial monetary judgments fines or penalties against us be resolved on unfavorable terms and require us to incur significant operational expenses the occurrence of incidents has in certain instances adversely affected and could in the future adversely affect our reputation cash flows financial position andor results of operations we maintain insurance against some but not all of these risks and losses 

failure to adapt to advances in technology and manage the related costs could make us less competitive and negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition 

a key element of our electric business model includes generating power at central station power plants to achieve economies of scale and produce power at a competitive cost we continue to research plan for and implement new technologies that produce reliable costefficient power or reduce power consumption and improve the impact on the environment these technologies many of which nisource is implementing include renewable energy distributed generation energy storage and energy efficiency advances in technology changes in laws or regulations including subsidization and other alternative methods of producing power could reduce the cost of electric generation from these sources to a level that is competitive with most central station power electric production causing power sales to decline and the value of our generating facilities to decline other new technologies require us to make significant expenditures to remain competitive and may result in the obsolescence of certain operating assets 

our natural gas business model depends on widespread utilization of natural gas for space heating as a core driver of revenues alternative energy sources new technologies or alternatives to natural gas space heating including cold climate heat pumps andor efficiency of other products could reduce demand and increase customer attrition which would impact our ability to recover on our investments in our gas distribution assets 

in addition customers are increasingly expecting additional communications increased access to information and expanded electronic capabilities regarding their electric and natural gas services which in some cases involves additional investments in technology we also rely on technology to adequately maintain key business records 

our future success will depend in part on our ability to anticipate and successfully adapt to technological changes to offer services that meet customer demands and evolving industry standards including environmental impacts associated with our products and services and to recover all or a significant portion of any unrecovered investment in obsolete assets a failure by us to effectively adapt to changes in technology and manage the related costs could harm our ability to remain competitive in the marketplace for our products and services and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition 

aging infrastructure may lead to disruptions in operations and increased capital expenditures and maintenance costs all of which could negatively impact our financial results 

we have risks associated with aging electric and gas infrastructure these risks can be driven by threats such as but not limited to electrical faults mechanical failure internal corrosion external corrosion ground movement and stress corrosion andor cracking the age of these assets may result in a need for replacement a higher level of maintenance costs or unscheduled outages despite efforts by us to properly maintain or upgrade these assets through inspection scheduled maintenance and capital investment in addition the nature of the information available on aging infrastructure assets which in some cases is incomplete may make the operation of the infrastructure inspections maintenance upgrading and replacement of the assets particularly challenging missing or incorrect infrastructure data may lead to 1 difficulty properly locating facilities which 

item 1a risk factors 

n i s ource i nc  

can result in excavator damage and operational or emergency response issues and 2 configuration and control risks associated with the modification of system operating pressures in connection with turning off or turning on service to customers which can result in unintended outages or operating pressures also additional maintenance and inspections are required in some instances in order to improve infrastructure information and records and address emerging regulatory or risk management requirements which increases our costs 

supply chain issues related to shortages of materials and transportation logistics may lead to delays in the maintenance and replacement of aging infrastructure which could increase the probability andor impact of a public safety incident we lack diversity in suppliers of gas materials we may not be effective in ensuring that we can obtain adequate emergency supply on a timely basis in each state that no compromises are being made on quality and that we have alternate suppliers available the failure to operate our assets as desired could result in interruption of electric service major component failure at generating facilities and electric substations gas leaks and other incidents and an inability to meet firm service and compliance obligations which could adversely impact revenues and could also result in increased capital expenditures and maintenance costs which if not fully recovered from customers could negatively impact our financial results 

we may be unable to obtain insurance on acceptable terms or at all and the insurance coverage we do obtain may not provide protection against all significant losses 

our ability to obtain insurance as well as the cost and coverage of such insurance are affected by developments affecting our business international national state or local events and the financial condition and underwriting considerations of insurers for example some insurers are moving away from underwriting certain carbonintensive energyrelated businesses such as those in the coal industry or those exposed to certain perils such as wildfires as well as gas explosion events or other infrastructurerelated risks the utility insurance market continues to be impacted by a prevalence of severe losses and despite significant increases in rates over the past few years markets are experiencing unacceptable loss ratios we have not been able to obtain liability insurance coverage at previously procured limits at rates that are acceptable to us capacity limits insurers are willing to issue have decreased requiring participation from more insurers to provide adequate coverage insurance coverage may not continue to be available at limits rates or terms acceptable to us the premiums we pay for our insurance coverage have significantly increased as a result of market conditions and the accumulated loss ratio over the history of our operations and we do not expect those costs to decline in addition our insurance is not sufficient or effective under all circumstances and against all hazards or liabilities to which we are subject for example total expenses related to the greater lawrence incident exceeded the total amount of liability coverage available under our policies certain types of damages expenses or claimed costs such as fines and penalties have been and in the future may be excluded under the policies in addition insurers providing insurance to us may raise defenses to coverage under the terms and conditions of the respective insurance policies that could result in a denial of coverage or limit the amount of insurance proceeds available to us any losses for which we are not fully insured or that are not covered by insurance at all could materially adversely affect our results of operations cash flows and financial position 

the implementation of nipsco’s electric generation strategy including the retirement of its coal generation units may not achieve intended results 

our plan to replace our coal generation capacity by the end of 2028 with primarily renewable resources is well underway we submitted an integrated resource plan the “plan” to the iurc and our preferred energy resource plan which refines the timeline to retire the michigan city generating station to occur between 2026 and 2028 we submitted our 2021 plan to the iurc in november 2021 the 2021 plan calls for the replacement of the retiring units with a diverse portfolio of resources including demand side management resources incremental solar standalone energy storage and upgrades to existing facilities at the sugar creek generating station among other steps the precise timing of the retirement will be informed by regulatory and policy changes our ability to maintain reliability of the system and our ability to secure replacement capacity for additional information see “results and discussion of segment operations  electric operations” in managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

there are inherent risks and uncertainties in executing the projects associated with the 2018 and 2021 plans both for what has been already executed and what capacity is still planned including changes in market conditions supply chain disruptions regulatory approvals environmental regulations commodity costs and customer expectations which may impede nipsco’s ability to achieve the intended results and associated timelines changes in the cost availability and supply of generation capacity may affect the implementation of the results from the 2021 plan advancements in technology in replacement resources may not become commercially available or economically feasible as projected in the 2021 plan and the implementation execution may vary from that which has been communicated nipsco’s future success will depend in part on its ability to successfully implement its longterm electric generation plans to offer services that meet customer demands and evolving industry standards and to recover all or a significant portion of any unrecovered investment in obsolete assets

nipsco’s electric generation strategy could require significant future capital expenditures operating costs and charges to earnings that may negatively impact our financial position financial results and cash flows an inability to secure and deliver on renewable projects would negatively impact our generation transition timeline achievement of decarbonization goals and reputation 

our capital projects and programs subject us to construction risks and natural gas costs and supply risks and are subject to regulatory oversight including requirements for permits approvals and certificates from various governmental agencies 

our business requires substantial capital expenditures for investments in among other things capital improvements to our electric generating facilities electric and natural gas distribution infrastructure natural gas storage and other projects including projects for environmental compliance we are engaged in intrastate natural gas pipeline modernization programs to maintain system integrity and enhance service reliability and flexibility nipsco also is currently engaged in a number of capital projects including environmental improvements to its electric generating stations the construction of new transmission and distribution facilities and new projects related to renewable energy as we undertake these projects and programs we may be unable to complete them on schedule or at the anticipated costs due in part to shortages in materials as described more fully below additionally we may construct or purchase some of these projects and programs to capture anticipated future growth which may not materialize and may cause the construction to occur over an extended period of time 

our existing and planned capital projects require numerous permits approvals and certificates from federal state and local governmental agencies if there is a delay in obtaining any required regulatory approvals or if we fail to obtain or maintain any required approvals or to comply with any applicable laws or regulations we may not be able to construct or operate our facilities we may be forced to incur additional costs or we may be unable to recover any or all amounts invested in a project we also may not receive the anticipated increases in revenue and cash flows resulting from such projects and programs until after their completion other construction risks include changes in the availability and costs of materials equipment commodities or labor including changes to tariffs on materials delays caused by construction incidents or injuries work stoppages shortages in qualified labor poor initial cost estimates unforeseen engineering issues the ability to obtain necessary rightsofway easements and transmissions connections and general contractors and subcontractors not performing as required under their contracts 

we are monitoring risks related to increasing order and delivery lead times for construction and other materials increasing risk associated with the unavailability of materials due to global shortages in raw materials and issues with transportation logistics and risk of decreased construction labor productivity in the event of disruptions in the availability of materials critical to our gas and electric operations our efforts to enhance our resiliency to supply chain shortages may not be effective we are also seeing increasing prices associated with certain materials equipment and products which impacts our ability to complete major capital projects at the cost that was planned and approved to the extent that delays occur or costs increase customer affordability as well as our business operations results of operations cash flows and financial condition could be materially adversely affected in addition to the extent that delays occur on projects that target system integrity the risk of an operational incident could increase for more information on global availability of materials for our renewable projects see   results and discussion of segment operations  electric operations  electric supply and generation transition 

to the extent that delays occur costs become unrecoverable or recovery is delayed or we otherwise become unable to effectively manage and complete our capital projects our results of operations cash flows and financial condition may be adversely affected 

a significant portion of the gas and electricity we sell is used by residential and commercial customers for heating and air conditioning accordingly fluctuations in weather gas and electricity commodity costs inflation and economic conditions impact demand of our customers and our operating results 

energy sales are sensitive to variations in weather forecasts of energy sales are based on “normal” weather which represents a longterm historical average significant variations from normal weather resulting from climate change or other factors could have and have had a material impact on energy sales additionally residential usage and to some degree commercial usage is sensitive to fluctuations in commodity costs for gas and electricity whereby usage declines with increased costs thus affecting our financial results commodity prices have been increasing rising gas costs could heighten regulator and stakeholder sensitivity relative to the impact of base rate increases on customer affordability lastly residential and commercial customers’ usage is sensitive to economic conditions and factors such as unemployment consumption and consumer confidence therefore prevailing economic conditions affecting the demand of our customers may in turn affect our financial results 

item 1a risk factors

fluctuations in the price of energy commodities or their related transportation costs or an inability to obtain an adequate reliable and costeffective fuel supply to meet customer demands may have a negative impact on our financial results 

our current electric generating fleet is dependent on coal and natural gas for fuel and our gas distribution operations purchase and resell a portion of the natural gas we deliver to our customers these energy commodities are subject to price fluctuations and fluctuations in associated transportation costs we use physical hedging through the use of storage assets and use financial products in certain jurisdictions in order to offset fluctuations in commodity supply prices we rely on regulatory recovery mechanisms in the various jurisdictions in order to fully recover the commodity costs incurred in selling energy to our customers however while we have historically been successful in the recovery of costs related to such commodity prices there can be no assurance that such costs will be fully recovered through rates in a timely manner 

in addition we depend on electric transmission lines natural gas pipelines and other transportation facilities owned and operated by third parties to deliver the electricity and natural gas we sell to wholesale markets supply natural gas to our gas storage and electric generation facilities and provide retail energy services to our customers if transportation is disrupted or if capacity is inadequate we may be unable to sell and deliver our gas and electric services to some or all of our customers as a result we may be required to procure additional or alternative electricity andor natural gas supplies at thencurrent market rates which if recovery of related costs is disallowed could have a material adverse effect on our businesses financial condition cash flows results of operations andor prospects 

failure to attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce and maintain good labor relations could harm our results of operations 

we operate in an industry that requires many of our employees and contractors to possess unique technical skill sets an aging workforce without appropriate replacements the mismatch of skill sets to future needs the unavailability of talent for internal positions and the unavailability of contract resources may lead to operating challenges or increased costs these operating challenges include lack of resources loss of knowledge and a lengthy time period associated with skill development for example certain skills such as those related to construction maintenance and repair of transmission and distribution systems are in high demand and have a limited supply current and prospective employees may determine that they do not wish to work for us due to market economic employment and other conditions including those related to organizational changes as described in the risk factor below 

we face increased competition for talent in the current environment of sustained labor shortage and increased turnover rates additionally any regulatory changes requiring us to enforce a covid19 vaccination mandate and how such a mandate is implemented could impact the availability of and our ability to attract and retain sufficient qualified employees we are also facing increasing risk of worker illness and availability due to more contagious covid19 variants these or other employee workforce factors could negatively impact our business financial condition or results of operations 

a significant portion of our workforce is subject to collective bargaining agreements several of which are currently being renegotiated our collective bargaining agreements are generally negotiated on an operating company basis with some companies having multiple bargaining agreements which may span different geographies any failure to reach an agreement on new labor contracts or to renegotiate these labor contracts might result in strikes boycotts or other labor disruptions our workforce continuity plans may not be effective in avoiding work stoppages that may result from labor negotiations or mass resignations labor disruptions strikes or significant negotiated wage and benefit increases whether due to union activities employee turnover or otherwise could have a material adverse effect on our businesses results of operations andor cash flows 

our strategic plan includes enhanced technology and transmission and distribution investments and a reduction in reliance on coalfired generation as part of our strategic plan we will need to attract and retain personnel that are qualified to implement our strategy and may need to retrain or reskill certain employees to support our longterm objectives 

failure to hire and retain qualified employees including the ability to transfer significant internal historical knowledge and expertise to the new employees may adversely affect our ability to manage and operate our business if we are unable to successfully attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce and maintain satisfactory collective bargaining agreements safety service reliability customer satisfaction and our results of operations could be adversely affected

if we cannot effectively manage new initiatives and organizational changes we will be unable to address the opportunities and challenges presented by our strategy and the business and regulatory environment 

in order to execute on our sustainable growth strategy and enhance our culture of ongoing continuous improvement we must effectively manage the complexity and frequency of new initiatives and organizational changes the organizational changes from the nisource next initiative have put shortterm pressure on employees due to the volume and pace of change and in some cases loss of personnel frontline workers are being impacted by the variety of process and technology changes that are currently in progress 

if we are unable to make decisions quickly assess our opportunities and risks and successfully implement new governance managerial and organizational processes as needed to execute our strategy in this increasingly dynamic and competitive business and regulatory environment our financial condition results of operations and relationships with our business partners regulators customers employees and stockholders may be negatively impacted 

actions of activist stockholders could negatively affect our business and stock price and cause us to incur significant expenses 

we may be subject to actions or proposals from activist stockholders or others that may not be aligned with our longterm strategy or the interests of our other stockholders we have had communications with an activist stakeholder our response to suggested actions proposals director nominations and contests for the election of directors activist stockholders could disrupt our business and operations divert the attention of our board of directors management and employees and be costly and time‐consuming potential actions by activist stockholders or others may interfere with our ability to execute our strategic plans create perceived uncertainties as to the future direction of our business or strategy cause uncertainty with our regulators make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel and adversely affect our relationships with our existing and potential business partners any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations also we may be required to incur significant fees and other expenses related to responding to shareholder activism including for thirdparty advisors moreover our stock price could be subject to significant fluctuation or otherwise be adversely affected by the events risks and uncertainties of any stockholder activism 

we outsource certain business functions to thirdparty suppliers and service providers and substandard performance by those third parties could harm our business reputation and results of operations 

utilities rely on extensive networks of business partners and suppliers to support critical enterprise capabilities across their organizations like other companies in the utilities industry we are seeing slowing deliveries from suppliers and in some cases materials and labor shortages for capital projects we outsource certain services to third parties in areas including construction services information technology materials fleet environmental operational services corporate and other areas in addition to delays and unavailability at times outsourcing of services to third parties could expose us to inferior service quality or substandard deliverables which may result in noncompliance including with applicable legal requirements and industry standards interruption of service or accidents or reputational harm which could negatively impact our results of operations we do not have full visibility into our supply chain which may impact our ability to serve customers in a safe reliable and costeffective manner these risks include the risk of operational failure reputation damage disruption due to new supply chain disruptions exposure to significant commercial losses and fines and poorly positioned and distressed suppliers if we continue to see delayed deliveries and shortages or if any other difficulties in the operations of these thirdparty suppliers and service providers including their systems were to occur they could adversely affect our results of operations or adversely affect our ability to work with regulators unions customers or employees 

a cyberattack on any of our or certain thirdparty technology systems upon which we rely may adversely affect our ability to operate and could lead to a loss or misuse of confidential and proprietary information or potential liability 

we are reliant on technology to run our business which is dependent upon financial and operational technology systems to process critical information necessary to conduct various elements of our business including the generation transmission and distribution of electricity operation of our gas pipeline facilities and the recording and reporting of commercial and financial transactions to regulators investors and other stakeholders in addition to general information and cyber risks that all large corporations face eg ransomware malware unauthorized access attempts phishing attacks malicious intent by insiders thirdparty software vulnerabilities and inadvertent disclosure of sensitive information the utility industry faces evolving and increasingly complex cybersecurity risks associated with protecting sensitive and confidential customer and employee information electric grid infrastructure and natural gas infrastructure deployment of new business technologies along with maintaining legacy technology represents a largescale opportunity for attacks on our information systems and confidential customer and employee information as well as on the integrity of the energy grid and the natural gas infrastructure increasing

n i s ource i nc  

largescale corporate attacks in conjunction with more sophisticated threats continue to challenge power and utility companies any failure of our technology systems or those of our customers suppliers or others with whom we do business could materially disrupt our ability to operate our business and could result in a financial loss and possibly do harm to our reputation 

additionally our information systems experience ongoing often sophisticated cyberattacks by a variety of sources including foreign sources with the apparent aim to breach our cyberdefenses while we have implemented and maintain a cybersecurity program designed to protect our information technology operational technology and data systems from such attacks our cybersecurity program does not prevent all breaches or cyberattack incidents we have experienced an increase in the number of attempts by external parties to access our networks or our company data without authorization we have experienced and expect to continue to experience cyber intrusions and attacks to our information systems and our operational technology to our knowledge none of these intrusions or attacks have resulted in a material cybersecurity intrusion or data breach the risk of a disruption or breach of our operational technology or the compromise of the data processed in connection with our operations through cybersecurity breach or ransomware attack has increased as attempted attacks have advanced in sophistication and number around the world technological complexities combined with advanced cyberattack techniques lack of cyber hygiene and human error can result in a cyber incident such as a ransomware attack supplier noncompliance with cyber controls can also result in a cyber incident attacks can occur at any point in the supply chain or with any suppliers 

in addition we collect and retain personally identifiable information of our customers stockholders and employees customers stockholders and employees expect that we will adequately protect their personal information the regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding 

although we attempt to maintain adequate defenses to these attacks and work through industry groups and trade associations to identify common threats and assess our countermeasures a security breach of our information systems andor operational technology or a security breach of the information systems of our customers suppliers or others with whom we do business could i adversely impact our ability to safely and reliably deliver electricity and natural gas to our customers through our generation transmission and distribution systems and potentially negatively impact our compliance with certain mandatory reliability and gas flow standards ii subject us to reputational and other harm or liabilities associated with theft or inappropriate release of certain types of information such as system operating information or information personal or otherwise relating to our customers or employees iii impact our ability to manage our businesses andor iv subject us to legal and regulatory proceedings and claims from third parties in addition to remediation costs any of which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our businesses cash flows financial condition results of operations andor prospects although we do maintain cyber insurance it is possible that such insurance will not adequately cover any losses or liabilities we may incur as a result of a cybersecurity incident 

compliance with and changes in cybersecurity requirements have a cost and operational impact on our business and failure to comply with such laws and regulations could adversely impact our reputation results of operations financial condition andor cash flows 

as cyberattacks are becoming more sophisticated us government warnings have indicated that critical infrastructure assets including pipelines and electric infrastructure may be specifically targeted by certain groups in 2021 the transportation security administration “tsa” announced two new security directives in response to a ransomware attack on the colonial pipeline that occurred earlier in the year these directives require critical pipeline owners to comply with mandatory reporting measures designate a cybersecurity coordinator provide vulnerability assessments and ensure compliance with certain cybersecurity requirements such directives or other requirements may require expenditure of significant additional resources to respond to cyberattacks to continue to modify or enhance protective measures or to assess investigate and remediate any critical infrastructure security vulnerabilities any failure to comply with such government regulations or failure in our cybersecurity protective measures may result in enforcement actions that may have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition in addition there is no certainty that costs incurred related to securing against threats will be recovered through rates 

we are exposed to significant reputational risks which make us vulnerable to a loss of cost recovery increased litigation and negative public perception 

as a utility company we are subject to adverse publicity focused on the reliability of our services the speed with which we are able to respond effectively to electric outages natural gas leaks or events and related accidents and similar interruptions caused by storm damage physical or cyber security incidents or other unanticipated events as well as our own or third parties actions or failure to act we are subject to prevailing labor markets and high attrition which may impact the speed of our customer service response we are also facing supply chain challenges the impacts of which may adversely impact our reputation in

several areas as described elsewhere in these risk factors we are also subject to adverse publicity related to actual or perceived environmental impacts if customers legislators or regulators have or develop a negative opinion of us this could result in less favorable legislative and regulatory outcomes or increased regulatory oversight increased litigation and negative public perception the adverse publicity and investigations we experienced as a result of the greater lawrence incident may have an ongoing negative impact on the public’s perception of us it is difficult to predict the ultimate impact of this adverse publicity the foregoing may have continuing adverse effects on our business results of operations cash flow and financial condition 

we have continued financial liabilities related to the sale of the massachusetts business 

on october 9 2020 we completed the sale of the massachusetts business to eversource the sale of the massachusetts business involves separation or carveout activities and costs and possible disputes with eversource we have continued financial liabilities with respect to the business conducted by columbia of massachusetts as we retain responsibility for and have agreed to indemnify eversource against certain liabilities this responsibility includes liabilities for any fines arising out of the greater lawrence incident and liabilities of columbia of massachusetts or its affiliates pursuant to civil claims for injury of persons or damage to property to the extent such injury or damage occurred prior to the closing in connection with the massachusetts business it may also be difficult to determine whether a claim from a third party is our responsibility and we may expend substantial resources trying to determine whether we or eversource has responsibility for the claim 

the impacts of natural disasters acts of terrorism acts of war civil unrest cyberattacks accidents public health emergencies or other catastrophic events may disrupt operations and reduce the ability to service customers 

a disruption or failure of natural gas distribution systems or within electric generation transmission or distribution systems in the event of a major hurricane tornado terrorist attack acts of war civil unrest cyberattack as further detailed above accident public health emergency pandemic or other catastrophic event could cause delays in completing sales providing services or performing other critical functions we have experienced disruptions in the past from hurricanes and tornadoes and other events of this nature also companies in our industry face a heightened risk of exposure to acts of terrorism and vandalism our electric and gas physical infrastructure may be targets of physical security threats or terrorist activities that could disrupt our operations we have increased security given the current environment and may be required by regulators or by the future threat environment to make investments in security that we cannot currently predict in addition the supply chain constraints that we are experiencing could impact timely restoration of services the occurrence of such events could adversely affect our financial position and results of operations in accordance with customary industry practice we maintain insurance against some but not all of these risks and losses 

the physical impacts of climate change and the transition to a lower carbon future are impacting our business 

climate change is exacerbating the risks to our physical infrastructure by increasing the frequency of extreme weather including heat stresses to power lines and storms and floods that damage infrastructure in addition climate change is likely to cause lake and river level changes that affect the manner in which services are currently provided and droughts or other stresses on water used to supply services and other extreme weather conditions we have adapted and will continue to evolve our infrastructure and operations to meet current and future needs of our stakeholders with higher frequency of these and possibly other extreme weather events it may become more costly for us to safely and reliably deliver certain products and services to our customers some of these costs may not be recovered to the extent that we are unable to recover those costs or if higher rates resulting from recovery of such costs result in reduced demand for services our future financial results may be adversely impacted further as the intensity and frequency of significant weather events increases it may impact our ability to secure costefficient insurance as described above 

our strategy may be impacted by policy and legal technology market and reputational risks and opportunities that are associated with the transition to a lowercarbon economy as disclosed in other risk factors in this section as a result of increased awareness regarding climate change coupled with adverse economic conditions availability of alternative energy sources including private solar microturbines fuel cells energyefficient buildings and energy storage devices and new regulations restricting emissions including potential regulations of methane emissions some consumers and companies may use less energy meet their own energy needs through alternative energy sources or avoid expansions of their facilities including natural gas facilities resulting in less demand for our services as these technologies become a more costcompetitive option over time whether through cost effectiveness or government incentives and subsidies certain customers may choose to meet their own energy needs and subsequently decrease usage of our systems and services which may result in among other things our generating facilities becoming less competitive and economical further evolving investor sentiment related to the use of fossil fuels and initiatives to restrict continued production of fossil fuels could result in a significant impact on our electric generation and natural gas businesses in the future conversely demand for our services may increase as a result of

customer changes in response to climate change for example as the utilization of electric vehicles increases demand for electricity may increase resulting in increased usage of our systems and services any negative opinions with respect to our environmental practices or our ability to meet the challenges posed by climate change formed by regulators customers investors or legislators could harm our reputation and change the perceived value of our products and services 

changes in policy to combat climate change and technology advancement each of which can also accelerate the implications of a transition to a lower carbon economy may materially adversely impact our business financial position results of operations and cash flows  

we are subject to operational and financial risks and liabilities associated with the implementation and efforts to achieve our carbon emission reduction goals 

nipsco’s electric generation transition is a key element of our goal to achieve a 90 reduction in our scope 1 ghg emissions by 2030 compared with 2005 levels our analysis and plan for execution which is outlined in the nipsco 2021 integrated resource plan requires us to make a number of assumptions these goals and underlying assumptions involve risks and uncertainties and are not guarantees should one or more of our underlying assumptions prove incorrect our actual results and ability to achieve our emissions goal could differ materially from our expectations certain of the assumptions that could impact our ability to meet our emissions goal include but are not limited to the accuracy of current emission measurements service territory size and capacity needs remaining in line with expectations regulatory approval impacts of future environmental regulations or legislation impact of future ghg pricing regulations or legislation including a future carbon tax or methane fee price availability and regulation of carbon offsets price of fuel such as natural gas cost of energy generation technologies such as wind and solar natural gas and storage solutions adoption of alternative energy by the public including adoption of electric vehicles rate of technology innovation with regards to alternative energy resources our ability to implement our modernization plans for our pipelines and facilities the ability to complete and implement generation alternatives to nipsco’s coal generation and retirement dates of nipsco’s coal facilities by 2030 the ability to construct andor permit new natural gas pipelines the ability to procure resources needed to build at a reasonable cost the lack of scarcity of resources and labor project cancellations construction delays or overruns and the ability to appropriately estimate costs of new generation impact of any supply chain disruptions and enhancement of energy efficiencies any negative opinions with respect to these goals or our environmental practices including any inability to achieve or a scaling back of these goals formed by regulators customers investors or legislators could harm our reputation and have an adverse effect on our financial condition 

financial economic and market risks 

we have substantial indebtedness which could adversely affect our financial condition 

our business is capital intensive and we rely significantly on longterm debt to fund a portion of our capital expenditures and repay outstanding debt and on shortterm borrowings to fund a portion of daytoday business operations we had total consolidated indebtedness of 98015 million outstanding as of december 31 2021 our substantial indebtedness could have important consequences for example it could 

• limit our ability to borrow additional funds or increase the cost of borrowing additional funds 

• reduce the availability of cash flow from operations to fund working capital capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes 

• limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in the business and the industries in which we operate 

• lead parties with whom we do business to require additional credit support such as letters of credit in order for us to transact such business 

• place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to competitors that are less leveraged 

• increase vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions and 

• limit our ability to execute on our growth strategy which is dependent upon access to capital to fund our substantial infrastructure investment program 

some of our debt obligations contain financial covenants related to debttocapital ratios and crossdefault provisions our failure to comply with any of these covenants could result in an event of default which if not cured or waived could result in the acceleration of outstanding debt obligations 

a drop in our credit ratings could adversely impact our cash flows results of operation financial condition and liquidity 

item 1a risk factors 

n i s ource i nc  

the availability and cost of credit for our businesses may be greatly affected by credit ratings the credit rating agencies periodically review our ratings taking into account factors such as our capital structure earnings profile and in 2020 and 2021 the impacts of the covid19 pandemic we are committed to maintaining investment grade credit ratings however there is no assurance we will be able to do so in the future our credit ratings could be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if in its judgment the circumstances warrant any negative rating action could adversely affect our ability to access capital at rates and on terms that are attractive a negative rating action could also adversely impact our business relationships with suppliers and operating partners who may be less willing to extend credit or offer us similarly favorable terms as secured in the past under such circumstances 

certain of our subsidiaries have agreements that contain “ratings triggers” that require increased collateral in the form of cash a letter of credit or other forms of security for new and existing transactions if our credit ratings including the standalone credit ratings of certain of our subsidiaries are dropped below investment grade these agreements are primarily for insurance purposes and for the physical purchase or sale of gas or power as of december 31 2021 the collateral requirement that would be required in the event of a downgrade below the ratings trigger levels would amount to approximately 562 million in addition to agreements with ratings triggers there are other agreements that contain “adequate assurance” or “material adverse change” provisions that could necessitate additional credit support such as letters of credit and cash collateral to transact business 

if our or certain of our subsidiaries credit ratings were downgraded especially below investment grade financing costs and the principal amount of borrowings would likely increase due to the additional risk of our debt and because certain counterparties may require additional credit support as described above such amounts may be material and could adversely affect our cash flows results of operations and financial condition losing investment grade credit ratings may also result in more restrictive covenants and reduced flexibility on repayment terms in debt issuances lower share price and greater stockholder dilution from common equity issuances in addition to reputational damage within the investment community 

the global outbreak of the novel coronavirus and its variants covid19 has adversely impacted and may continue to adversely impact our business results of operations financial condition liquidity and cash flows 

the covid19 pandemic has resulted in widespread impacts on the global economy and financial markets and could lead to a prolonged reduction in economic activity extended disruptions to supply chains and capital markets and reduced labor availability and productivity we continue to monitor how covid19 is affecting our workforce customers suppliers operations financial results and cash flow the extent of the impact in the future will vary and depend on the duration and severity of the impact on the global national and local economies 

our future operating results and liquidity may continue to be impacted by the pandemic but the extent of the impact remains uncertain primarily in 2020 we experienced lower revenues higher expenses for personal protective equipment and supplies and higher bad debt expense as a consequence of the pandemic which negatively impacted our results of operations although our revenues were higher in 2021 compared to 2020 we may continue to experience ongoing impact of the pandemic which includes but is not limited to 

• lower revenue and cash flow resulting from the decrease in commercial and industrial gas and electric demand as businesses comply with operating restrictions andor businesses experience negative economic impact from the pandemic potentially offset by higher residential demand 

• lower revenue and cash flow in the event of the suspension of late payment and reconnection fees in some jurisdictions 

• a decline in revenue due to an increase in customer attrition rates as well as lower revenue growth if customer additions slow due to a prolonged economic downturn 

• a continued increase in bad debt and a decrease in cash flows resulting from the suspension of shutoffs and the inability of our customers to pay for their gas and electric service due to job loss or other factors partially offset by regulatory deferrals 

• lower revenues on a prolonged basis resulting from higher customer bankruptcies predominately focused on commercial and industrial customers not able to sustain operations through any broader economic downturn 

• a continued delay in cash flows as more customers utilize the more flexible payment plans we offer and 

• an increase in internal labor costs from higher overtime 

we also face the risk of not achieving operational compliance andor customer requirements because of work restrictions or unavailable employees due to the pandemic for more information regarding the items above and additional items related to the pandemic that we are evaluating and monitoring please see our discussion of these topics in part ii item 7 management

discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  executive summary  introduction  covid19 in this report and in our future filings with the securities and exchange commission to the extent the pandemic adversely affects our business results of operations financial condition liquidity or cash flows it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risk factors described herein 

the duration and ultimate impact of the covid19 pandemic on our business results of operations and financial condition including liquidity capital and financing resources will depend on numerous evolving factors and future developments which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted at this time such factors and developments may include the geographic spread severity and duration of the covid19 pandemic including whether there are periods of increased covid19 cases the further spread of the delta variant omicron variant or the emergence of other new or more contagious variants that may render vaccines ineffective or less effective disruption to our operations resulting from employee illnesses or any inability to attract retain or motivate employees the development availability and administration of effective treatment or vaccines and the willingness of individuals to receive a vaccine or otherwise comply with various mandates the extent and duration of the impact on the us or global economy including the pace and extent of recovery when the covid19 pandemic subsides and the actions that have been or may be taken by various governmental authorities in response to the outbreak 

adverse economic and market conditions including as a result of the covid19 pandemic increases in interest rates or changes in investor sentiment could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations cash flows financial condition and liquidity 

deteriorating sluggish or volatile economic conditions in our operating jurisdictions could adversely impact our ability to maintain or grow our customer base and collect revenues from customers which could reduce our revenue or growth rate and increase operating costs the continued spread of covid19 has resulted in widespread impacts on the global economy and financial markets and could lead to a prolonged reduction in economic activity disruptions to supply chains and capital markets and reduced labor availability and productivity 

in connection with the pandemic certain state regulatory commissions instituted disconnection moratoriums and the suspension of collection of late payment fees deposits and reconnection fees which impacted our ability to pursue our standard credit risk mitigation practices following the issuance of these moratoriums certain of our regulated operations have been authorized to record a regulatory asset for bad debt expense above levels currently in rates we have reinstated our common credit mitigation practices as moratoriums have expired but it is possible that such moratoriums will be reinstated as the pandemic continues 

in addition the pandemic has impacted our physical business operations resulting in delays in conducting certain residential work and additional costs required to comply with pandemicrelated health and safety protocols 

further we rely on access to the capital markets to finance our liquidity and longterm capital requirements including expenditures for our utility infrastructure and to comply with future regulatory requirements to the extent not satisfied by the cash flow generated by our operations we have historically relied on longterm debt and on the issuance of equity securities to fund a portion of our capital expenditures and repay outstanding debt and on shortterm borrowings to fund a portion of daytoday business operations successful implementation of our longterm business strategies including capital investment is dependent upon our ability to access the capital and credit markets including the banking and commercial paper markets on competitive terms and rates an economic downturn or uncertainty market turmoil changes in interest rates changes in tax policy challenges faced by financial institutions changes in our credit ratings or a change in investor sentiment toward us or the utilities industry generally could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital or refinance debt for example because nipsco’s current generating facilities substantially rely on coal for its operations certain financial institutions may choose not to participate in our financing arrangements in addition large institutional investors may choose to sell or choose not to purchase our stock due to environmental social and governance “esg” concerns or concerns regarding renewable energy supply chain challenges reduced access to capital markets increased borrowing costs andor lower equity valuation levels could reduce future earnings per share and cash flows refer to note 15 “longterm debt” in the notes to consolidated financial statements for information related to outstanding longterm debt and maturities of that debt in addition any rise in interest rates may lead to higher borrowing costs which may adversely impact reported earnings cost of capital and capital holdings 

if in the future we face limits to the credit and capital markets or experience significant increases in the cost of capital or are unable to access the capital markets it could limit our ability to implement or increase the costs of implementing our business plan which in turn could materially and adversely affect our results of operations cash flows financial condition and liquidity

most of our revenues are subject to economic regulation at either the federal or state level as such the revenues generated by us are subject to regulatory review by the applicable federal or state authority these rate reviews determine the rates charged to customers and directly impact revenues our financial results are dependent on frequent regulatory proceedings in order to ensure timely recovery of costs and investments as described in more detail in the risk factor below the outcomes of these proceedings are uncertain potentially lengthy and could be influenced by many factors some of which may be outside of our control including the cost of providing service the necessity of expenditures the quality of service regulatory interpretations customer intervention economic conditions and the political environment further the rate orders are subject to appeal which creates additional uncertainty as to the rates that will ultimately be allowed to be charged for services 

the actions of regulators and legislators could result in outcomes that may adversely affect our earnings and liquidity 

the rates that our electric and natural gas companies charge their customers are determined by their state regulatory commissions and by the ferc these commissions also regulate the companies accounting operations the issuance of certain securities and certain other matters the ferc also regulates the transmission of electric energy the sale of electric energy at wholesale accounting issuance of certain securities and certain other matters including reliability standards through the north american electric reliability corporation nerc 

under state and federal law our electric and natural gas companies are entitled to charge rates that are sufficient to allow them an opportunity to recover their prudently incurred operating and capital costs and a reasonable rate of return on invested capital to attract needed capital and maintain their financial integrity while also protecting relevant public interests our electric and natural gas companies are required to engage in regulatory approval proceedings as a part of the process of establishing the terms and rates for their respective services each of these companies prepares and submits periodic rate filings with their respective regulatory commissions for review and approval which allows for various entities to challenge our current or future rates structures or mechanisms and could alter or limit the rates we are allowed to charge our customers these proceedings typically involve multiple parties including governmental bodies and officials consumer advocacy groups and various consumers of energy who have differing concerns any change in rates including changes in allowed rate of return are subject to regulatory approval proceedings that can be contentious lengthy and subject to appeal this may lead to uncertainty as to the ultimate result of those proceedings established rates are also subject to subsequent prudency reviews by state regulators whereby various portions of rates could be adjusted subject to refund or disallowed including cost recovery mechanisms the ultimate outcome and timing of regulatory rate proceedings could have a significant effect on our ability to recover costs or earn an adequate return adverse decisions in our proceedings could adversely affect our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

there can be no assurance that regulators will approve the recovery of all costs incurred by our electric and natural gas companies including costs for construction operation and maintenance and compliance with current and future changes in environmental federal pipeline safety critical infrastructure and cyber security laws and regulations challenges arise with state regulators on inflationary pricing for electric and gas materials and potential price increases ensuring that updated pricing for electric and gas materials is included in plans and regulatory assumptions and ensuring there is a regulatory recovery model for emergency inventory stock there is debate among state regulators and other stakeholders over how to transition to a decarbonized economy and prudency arguments relative to investing in natural gas assets when the depreciable life of the assets may be shortened due to electrification the inability to recover a significant amount of operating costs could have an adverse effect on a company’s financial position results of operations and cash flows 

changes to rates may occur at times different from when costs are incurred additionally catastrophic events at other utilities could result in our regulators and legislators imposing additional requirements that may lead to additional costs for the companies 

in addition to the risk of disallowance of incurred costs regulators may also impose downward adjustments in a company’s allowed roe as well as assess penalties and fines regulators may reduce roe to mitigate potential customer bill increases due to items unrelated to capital investments such as potential increases in taxes and incremental costs related to covid19 these actions would have an adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

our electric business is subject to mandatory reliability and critical infrastructure protection standards established by nerc and enforced by the ferc the critical infrastructure protection standards focus on controlling access to critical physical and cybersecurity assets compliance with the mandatory reliability standards could subject our electric utilities to higher operating costs in addition compliance with phmsa regulations could subject our gas utilities to higher operating costs if our

businesses are found to be in noncompliance we could be subject to sanctions including substantial monetary penalties or damage to our reputation 

changes in tax laws as well as the potential tax effects of business decisions could negatively impact our business results of operations including our expected project returns from our planned renewable energy projects financial condition and cash flows 

our business operations are subject to economic conditions in certain industries 

business operations throughout our service territories have been and may continue to be adversely affected by economic events at the national and local level where our businesses operate in particular sales to large industrial customers such as those in the steel oil refining industrial gas and related industries are impacted by economic downturns including the downturn resulting from the covid19 pandemic geographic or technological shifts in production or production methods and consumer demand for environmentally friendly products and practices the us manufacturing industry continues to adjust to changing market conditions including international competition inflation and increasing costs and fluctuating demand for its products in addition our results of operations are negatively impacted by lower revenues resulting from higher bankruptcies predominately focused on commercial and industrial customers not able to sustain operations through the economic disruptions related to the pandemic 

we are exposed to risk that customers will not remit payment for delivered energy or services and that suppliers or counterparties will not perform under various financial or operating agreements 

our extension of credit is governed by a corporate credit risk policy involves considerable judgment by our employees and is based on an evaluation of a customer or counterparty’s financial condition credit history and other factors we monitor our credit risk exposure by obtaining credit reports and updated financial information for customers and suppliers and by evaluating the financial status of our banking partners and other counterparties by reference to marketbased metrics such as credit default swap pricing levels and to traditional credit ratings provided by the major credit rating agencies adverse economic conditions result in an increase in defaults by customers suppliers and counterparties as stated above in connection with the covid19 pandemic state regulatory moratoriums which have now expired impacted our ability to pursue our standard credit risk mitigation practices 

we are a holding company and are dependent on cash generated by our subsidiaries to meet our debt obligations and pay dividends on our stock 

we are a holding company and conduct our operations primarily through our subsidiaries which are separate and distinct legal entities substantially all of our consolidated assets are held by our subsidiaries accordingly our ability to meet our debt obligations or pay dividends on our common stock and preferred stock is largely dependent upon cash generated by these subsidiaries in the event a major subsidiary is not able to pay dividends or transfer cash flows to us our ability to service our debt obligations or pay dividends could be negatively affected 

the trading prices for our equity units initially consisting of corporate units and related treasury units and series c mandatory convertible preferred stock are expected to be affected by among other things the trading prices of our common stock the general level of interest rates and our credit quality 

the trading prices of the equity units initially consisting of corporate units which are listed on the new york stock exchange and the related treasury units and series c mandatory convertible preferred stock in the secondary market are expected to be affected by among other things the trading prices of our common stock the general level of interest rates and our credit quality it is impossible to predict whether the price of our common stock or interest rates will rise or fall the price of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in the future in response to many events or factors including those discussed in the risk factors herein many of which events and factors are beyond our control fluctuations in interest rates may give rise to arbitrage opportunities based upon changes in the relative value of the common stock underlying the purchase contracts and of the other components of the equity units any such arbitrage could in turn affect the trading prices of the corporate units treasury units mandatory convertible preferred stock and our common stock 

the early settlement right triggered under certain circumstances and the supermajority rights of the mandatory convertible preferred stock following a fundamental change could discourage a potential acquirer 

the fundamental change early settlement right with respect to the purchase contracts triggered under certain circumstances by a fundamental change and the supermajority voting rights of the mandatory convertible preferred stock in connection with certain

fundamental change transactions jointly could discourage a potential acquirer including potential acquirers that would otherwise seek a transaction with us that would be attractive to our investors 

our equity units initially consisting of corporate units and related mandatory convertible preferred stock and the issuance and sale of common stock in settlement of the purchase contracts and conversion of mandatory convertible preferred stock may all adversely affect the market price of our common stock and will cause dilution to our stockholders 

the market price of our common stock is likely to be influenced by our equity units initially consisting of corporate units and related mandatory convertible preferred stock for example the market price of our common stock could become more volatile and could be depressed by 

• investors’ anticipation of the sale into the market of a substantial number of additional shares of our common stock issued upon settlement of the purchase contracts or conversion of our mandatory convertible preferred stock 

• possible sales of our common stock by investors who view our equity units initially consisting of corporate units or related mandatory convertible preferred stock as a more attractive means of equity participation in us than owning shares of our common stock and 

• hedging or arbitrage trading activity that may develop involving our equity units initially consisting of corporate units or related mandatory convertible preferred stock and our common stock 

in addition we cannot predict the effect that future issuances or sales of our common stock if any including those made upon the settlement of the purchase contracts or conversion of the mandatory convertible preferred stock may have on the market price for our common stock 

our equity units initially consisting of corporate units and the issuance and sale of substantial amounts of common stock including issuances and sales upon the settlement of the purchase contracts or conversion of the mandatory convertible preferred stock could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and will cause dilution to our stockholders 

capital market performance and other factors may decrease the value of benefit plan assets which then could require significant additional funding and impact earnings 

the performance of the capital markets affects the value of the assets that are held in trust to satisfy future obligations under defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans we have significant obligations in these areas and hold significant assets in these trusts as noted in note 12 pension and other postretirement benefits in the notes to consolidated financial statements these assets are subject to market fluctuations and may yield uncertain returns which fall below our projected rates of return a decline in the market value of assets may increase the funding requirements of the obligations under the defined benefit pension plan additionally changes in interest rates affect the liabilities under these benefit plans as interest rates decrease the liabilities increase which could potentially increase funding requirements further the funding requirements of the obligations related to these benefits plans may increase due to changes in governmental regulations and participant demographics including increased numbers of retirements or longer life expectancy assumptions as well as voluntary early retirements in addition lower asset returns result in increased expenses ultimately significant funding requirements and increased pension or other postretirement benefit plan expense could negatively impact our results of operations and financial position 

we have significant goodwill any future impairments of goodwill could result in a significant charge to earnings in a future period and negatively impact our compliance with certain covenants under financing agreements 

in accordance with gaap we test goodwill for impairment at least annually and review our definitelived intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate its fair value might be below its carrying value goodwill is also tested for impairment when factors examples of which include reduced cash flow estimates a sustained decline in stock price or market capitalization below book value indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 

a significant charge in the future could impact the capitalization ratio covenant under certain financing agreements we are subject to a financial covenant under our revolving credit facility which requires us to maintain a debt to capitalization ratio that does not exceed 70 as of december 31 2021 the ratio was 574

changes in the method for determining libor and the potential replacement of the libor benchmark interest rate could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

some of our indebtedness bears interest at a variable rate based on libor from time to time we also enter into hedging instruments to manage our exposure to fluctuations in the libor benchmark interest rate in addition these hedging instruments as well as hedging instruments that our subsidiaries use for hedging natural gas price and basis risk rely on liborbased rates to calculate interest accrued on certain payments that may be required to be made under these agreements such as late payments or interest accrued if any cash collateral should be held by a counterparty any changes announced by regulators in the method pursuant to which the libor rates are determined may result in a sudden or prolonged increase or decrease in the reported libor rates if that were to occur the level of interest payments we incur may change 

in july 2017 the united kingdom financial conduct authority “fca” which regulates libor announced that the fca intends to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of libor after 2021 in november 2020 the board of governors of the us federal reserve system the federal deposit insurance corporation and the office of the us comptroller of the currency collectively issued a statement encouraging banks to stop entering into financial contracts that use libor as a reference rate as soon as possible and no later than december 31 2021 in march 2021 the fca announced that 1week and 2‑month us dollar “usd” libor will cease publication after december 31 2021 and that the remaining usd libor tenors will cease publication after june 30 2023 it is not possible to predict the effect of these changes other reforms or the establishment of alternative reference rates in the united kingdom or elsewhere in the united states efforts to identify a set of alternative us dollar reference interest rates include proposals by the alternative reference rates committee of the federal reserve board and the federal reserve bank of new york the alternative reference rates committee has proposed the secured overnight financing rate sofr as its recommended alternative to libor and the federal reserve bank of new york began publishing sofr rates in april 2018 on february 18 2022 we entered into an amended and restated revolving credit agreement which among other things amended the interest rate provisions applicable to borrowings under this agreement to utilize sofr as the reference rate rather than libor sofr is intended to be a broad measure of the cost of borrowing cash overnight that is collateralized by us treasury securities however because sofr is a broad us treasury repurchase agreement financing rate that represents overnight secured funding transactions it differs fundamentally from libor because of these and other differences there is no assurance that sofr will perform in the same way as libor would have performed at any time and there is no guarantee that it is a comparable substitute for libor 

in addition although certain of our libor based obligations provide for alternative methods of calculating the interest rate payable on certain of our obligations if libor is not reported uncertainty as to the extent and manner of future changes may result in interest rates andor payments that are higher than lower than or that do not otherwise correlate over time with the interest rates or payments that would have been made on our obligations if a liborbased rate was available in its current form 

litigation regulatory and legislative risks 

the outcome of legal and regulatory proceedings investigations inquiries claims and litigation related to our business operations may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position or liquidity 

we are involved in legal and regulatory proceedings investigations inquiries claims and litigation in connection with our business operations including those related to the greater lawrence incident the most significant of which are summarized in note 19 “other commitments and contingencies” in the notes to consolidated financial statements our insurance does not cover all costs and expenses that we have incurred relating to the greater lawrence incident and may not fully cover incidents that could occur in the future due to the inherent uncertainty of the outcomes of such matters there can be no assurance that the resolution of any particular claim or proceeding would not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position or liquidity 

the greater lawrence incident has materially adversely affected and may continue to materially adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

in connection with the greater lawrence incident we have incurred and will incur various costs and expenses while we have recovered the full amount of our liability insurance coverage available under our policies total expenses related to the incident exceeded such amount expenses in excess of our liability insurance coverage have materially adversely affected and may continue to materially adversely affect our results of operations cash flows and financial position we may also incur additional costs associated with the greater lawrence incident beyond the amount currently anticipated including in connection with civil litigation further state or federal legislation may be enacted that would require us to incur additional costs by mandating various changes including changes to our operating practice standards for natural gas distribution operations and safety in

addition if it is determined in other matters that we did not comply with applicable statutes regulations or rules in connection with the operations or maintenance of our natural gas system and we are ordered to pay additional amounts in penalties or other amounts our financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

our settlement with the us attorney’s office in respect of federal charges in connection with the greater lawrence incident may expose us to further penalties liabilities and private litigation and may impact our operations 

on february 26 2020 the company entered into a dpa and columbia of massachusetts entered into a plea agreement with the us attorney’s office to resolve the us attorney’s office’s investigation relating to the greater lawrence incident which was subsequently approved by the united states district court for the district of massachusetts the court the agreements impose various compliance and remedial obligations on the company and columbia of massachusetts failure to comply with the terms of these agreements could result in further enforcement action by the us attorney’s office expose the company and columbia of massachusetts to penalties financial or otherwise and subject the company to further private litigation each of which could impact our operations and have a material adverse effect on our business 

our businesses are subject to various federal state and local laws regulations tariffs and policies we could be materially adversely affected if we fail to comply with such laws regulations tariffs and policies or with any changes in or new interpretations of such laws regulations tariffs and policies 

our businesses are subject to various federal state and local laws regulations tariffs and policies including but not limited to those relating to natural gas pipeline safety employee safety the environment and our energy infrastructure in particular we are subject to significant federal state and local regulations applicable to utility companies including regulations by the various utility commissions in the states where we serve customers these regulations significantly influence our operating environment may affect our ability to recover costs from utility customers and cause us to incur substantial compliance and other costs existing laws regulations tariffs and policies may be revised or become subject to new interpretations and new laws regulations tariffs and policies may be adopted or become applicable to us and our operations in some cases compliance with new laws regulations tariffs and policies increases our costs supply chain constraints may challenge our ability to remain in compliance if we cannot obtain the materials that we need to operate our business in a compliant manner if we fail to comply with laws regulations and tariffs applicable to us or with any changes in or new interpretations of such laws regulations tariffs or policies our financial condition results of operations regulatory outcomes and cash flows may be materially adversely affected 

our businesses are regulated under numerous environmental laws the cost of compliance with these laws and changes to or additions to or reinterpretations of the laws could be significant liability from the failure to comply with existing or changed laws could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

our businesses are subject to extensive federal state and local environmental laws and rules that regulate among other things air emissions water usage and discharges ghg and waste products such as coal combustion residuals compliance with these legal obligations require us to make expenditures for installation of pollution control equipment remediation environmental monitoring emissions fees and permits at many of our facilities these expenditures are significant and we expect that they will continue to be significant in the future furthermore if we fail to comply with environmental laws and regulations or are found to have caused damage to the environment or persons that failure or harm may result in the assessment of civil or criminal penalties and damages against us injunctions to remedy the failure or harm and the inability to operate facilities as designed 

existing environmental laws and regulations may be revised and new laws and regulations seeking to change environmental regulation of the energy industry may be adopted or become applicable to us with an increasing focus on both coal and natural gas revised or additional laws and regulations may result in significant additional expense and operating restrictions on our facilities or increased compliance costs which may not be fully recoverable from customers through regulated rates and could therefore impact our financial position financial results and cash flow moreover such costs could materially affect the continued economic viability of one or more of our facilities 

an area of significant uncertainty and risk are the laws concerning emission of ghg while we continue to reduce ghg emissions through the retirement of coalfired electric generation increased sourcing of renewable energy priority pipeline replacement energy efficiency programs and leak detection and repair ghg emissions are currently an expected aspect of the electric and natural gas business revised or additional future ghg legislation andor regulation related to the generation of electricity or the extraction production distribution transmission storage and end use of natural gas could materially impact our gas supply financial position financial results and cash flows

summary of consolidated financial results 

a summary of our consolidated financial results for the years ended december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 are presented below 



the majority of the costs of energy in both segments are tracked costs that are passed through directly to the customer resulting in an equal and offsetting amount reflected in operating revenues 

the increase in net income available to common shareholders during 2021 was primarily due to higher operating income for the year ended december 31 2021 compared to the same period in 2020 operating revenues were higher due to favorable rate case outcomes in 2021 operating expenses were lower as we did not have expenses associated with the massachusetts business in 2021 and the loss on sale of the massachusetts business was primarily incurred in 2020 for additional information on operating income variance drivers see results and discussion of segment operations for gas and electric operations in this managements discussion in addition we recognized a favorable change in total other deductions which was partially offset by an increase in income tax expense in 2021 see below for the primary drivers of this change

other deductions net 

the change in other deductions net in 2021 compared to 2020 is primarily driven by the loss on early extinguishment of debt in 2020 lower longterm and shortterm debt interest in 2021 and higher nonservice pension benefits partially offset by charitable contributions in 2021 the lower interest in 2021 was due to the early extinguishment of high rate debt in 2020 and lower balances on shortterm debt during the year ended december 31 2021 compared to the same period in 2020 see note 15 longterm debt note 16 shortterm borrowings and note 12 pension and other postretirement benefits in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

income taxes 

the increase in income tax expense in 2021 compared to the same period in 2020 is primarily attributable to higher pretax income resulting from the items discussed above state jurisdictional mix of pretax income in 2021 tax effected at statutory tax rates and increased amortization of excess deferred federal income taxes in 2021 compared to 2020 these items are offset by decreased deferred tax expense recognized on the sale of the columbia of massachusetts regulatory liability in 2020 established due to tcja in 2017 that would have otherwise been recognized over the amortization period and onetime adjustments to deferred tax balances

results and discussion of operations 

presentation of segment information 

our operations are divided into two primary reportable segments gas distribution operations and electric operations the remainder of our operations which are not significant enough on a standalone basis to warrant treatment as an operating segment are presented as corporate and other within the notes to the consolidated financial statements and primarily are comprised of interest expense on holding company debt and unallocated corporate costs and activities

weather 

in general we calculate the weatherrelated revenue variance based on changing customer demand driven by weather variance from normal heating degree days net of weather normalization mechanisms our composite heating degree days reported do not directly correlate to the weatherrelated dollar impact on the results of gas distribution operations heating degree days experienced during different times of the year or in different operating locations may have more or less impact on volume and dollars depending on when and where they occur when the detailed results are combined for reporting there may be weatherrelated dollar impacts on operations when there is not an apparent or significant change in our aggregated composite heating degree day comparison 

throughput 

the decrease in total volumes sold and transported in 2021 compared to 2020 of 545 mmdth is primarily attributable to the sale of the massachusetts business in 2020 

commodity price impact 

cost of energy for the gas distribution operations segment is principally comprised of the cost of natural gas used while providing transportation and distribution services to customers all of our gas distribution operations companies have stateapproved recovery mechanisms that provide a means for full recovery of prudently incurred gas costs these are tracked costs that are passed through directly to the customer and the gas costs included in revenues are matched with the gas cost expense recorded in the period the difference is recorded on the consolidated balance sheets as underrecovered or overrecovered gas cost to be included in future customer billings therefore increases in these tracked operating expenses are offset by increases in operating revenues and have essentially no impact on net income 

certain gas distribution operations companies continue to offer choice opportunities where customers can choose to purchase gas from a thirdparty supplier through regulatory initiatives in their respective jurisdictions

columbia of massachusetts asset sale 

on october 9 2020 we completed the sale of our massachusetts business in march 2021 we reached an agreement with eversource regarding the final purchase price including net working capital adjustments this resulted in a pretax loss for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 of 68 million and 4124 million respectively based on asset and liability balances as of the close of the transaction on october 9 2020 transaction costs and the final purchase price the pretax loss is presented as loss on sale of assets net on the statements of consolidated income loss

weather 

in general we calculate the weatherrelated revenue variance based on changing customer demand driven by weather variance from normal heating or cooling degree days our composite heating or cooling degree days reported do not directly correlate to the weatherrelated dollar impact on the results of electric operations heating or cooling degree days experienced during different times of the year may have more or less impact on volume and dollars depending on when they occur when the detailed results are combined for reporting there may be weatherrelated dollar impacts on operations when there is not an apparent or significant change in our aggregated composite heating or cooling degree day comparison 

sales 

the increase in total volumes sold in 2021 compared to 2020 of 10278 gwh was primarily attributable to decreased usage by industrial and commercial customers during the second and third quarters of 2020 due to covid19 there was no significant variance during the first three months and last three months of 2021 compared to the same period in 2020 

commodity price impact 

cost of energy for the electric operations segment is principally comprised of the cost of coal natural gas purchased for internal generation of electricity at nipsco and the cost of power purchased from thirdparty generators of electricity nipsco has a stateapproved recovery mechanism that provides a means for full recovery of prudently incurred fuel costs the majority of these fuel costs are passed through directly to the customer and the fuel costs included in operating revenues are matched with the fuel cost expense recorded in the period the difference is recorded on the consolidated balance sheets as underrecovered or overrecovered fuel cost to be included in future customer billings therefore increases in these tracked operating expenses are offset by increases in operating revenues and have essentially no impact on net income

nipscos performance remains closely linked to the performance of the steel industry nipsco’s mwh sales to steelrelated industries accounted for approximately 481 and 459 of the total industrial mwh sales for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively 



electric supply and generation transition 

nipsco continues to execute on an electric generation transition consistent with the preferred pathway from its 2018 integrated resource plan which outlines plans to retire its remaining coalfired generation by 2028 to be replaced by lowercost reliable and cleaner options we expect to have capital investment requirements of approximately 20 billion primarily in 2022 and 2023 to replace the generation capacity of rm schahfer generating stations coalfired units we retired rm schahfer generating station units 14 and 15 on october 1 2021 the remaining two units are still scheduled to be retired in 2023 refer to note 6 property plant and equipment and note 19f other matters in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 

the current replacement plan primarily includes renewable sources of energy including wind solar and battery storage to be obtained through a combination of nipsco ownership and ppas nipsco has sold and may in the future sell renewable energy credits from this generation to third parties because this helps keep the cost of energy more affordable for our customers nipsco has executed several ppas to purchase 100 of the output from renewable generation facilities at a fixed price per mwh each facility supplying the energy will have an associated nameplate capacity and payments under the ppas will not begin until the associated generation facility is constructed by the ownerseller nipsco has also executed several btas with developers to construct renewable generation facilities our current replacement program will be augmented by the preferred energy resource plan outlined in our 2021 integrated resource plan see executive summary  your energy your future in this managements discussion for additional information

liquidity and capital resources 

we continually evaluate the availability of adequate financing to fund our ongoing business operations working capital and core safety and infrastructure investment programs our financing is sourced through cash flow from operations and the issuance of debt andor equity external debt financing is provided primarily through the issuance of longterm debt accounts receivable securitization programs and our 15 billion commercial paper program which is backstopped by our committed revolving credit facility with a total availability from thirdparty lenders of 185 billion on february 18 2022 we amended our revolving credit agreement to among other things extend its term to february 18 2027 the commercial paper program and credit facility provide costeffective shortterm financing until it can be replaced with a balance of longterm debt and equity financing that achieves our desired capital structure we utilize an atm equity program that allows us to issue and sell shares of our common stock up to an aggregate issuance of 7500 million through december 31 2023 as of december 31 2021 the atm program including the impact of the forward sale agreement had approximately 3000 million of equity available for issuance on april 19 2021 we completed the sale of 8625 million equity units which provided net proceeds of 8355 million  after underwriting and issuance costs we intend to use the net proceeds from the offering for renewable generation investments and general corporate purposes including additions to working capital and repayment of existing indebtedness see note 13 equity in the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information on our atm program and equity units 

we believe these sources provide adequate capital to fund our operating activities and capital expenditures in 2022 and beyond 

greater lawrence incident as discussed in part i item 1a risk factors and in note 19 other commitments and contingencies in the notes to consolidated financial statements due to the inherent uncertainty of litigation there can be no assurance that the outcome or resolution of any particular claim related to the greater lawrence incident will not continue to have an adverse impact on our cash flows through income generated from operating activities amounts available under the shortterm revolving credit facility and our ability to access capital markets we believe we have adequate capital available to settle remaining anticipated claims associated with the greater lawrence incident 

operating activities 

net cash from operating activities for the year ended december 31 2021 was 12179 million an increase of 1139 million from 2020 this increase was primarily driven by a year over year decrease in net payments related to the greater lawrence incident during 2021 we paid 156 million compared to 2267 million of payments during the same period in 2020 this was offset by increased cash outflows related to inventory balances primarily due to lower purchasing and prices in 2020 as well as decreased cash inflows related to the under collection of gas and fuel costs 

investing activities 

net cash used for investing activities for the year ended december 31 2021 was 22049 million an increase of 13258 million from 2020 in 2020 our investing outflows were lower by 11159 million as a result of proceeds from the sale of the massachusetts business our current year investing activities were comprised of capital expenditures related to system growth and reliability and payments made to the developers of our renewable generation assets

capital expenditures the table below reflects actual capital expenditures and certain other investing activities by segment for 2021 



1 amounts differ from those presented in note 23 segments of business in the notes to consolidated financial statements due to the allocation of corporate and other maintenance costs to the gas distribution and electric operations segments 

2 amounts differ from those presented on the statements of consolidated cash flows primarily due to the capitalized portion of the corporate incentive plan payout inclusion of capital expenditures included in current liabilities and afudc equity 

we expect to make capital investments totaling approximately 10 billion during the 20212024 period comprised of annual investments of 19 to 22 billion for growth safety and reliability and an additional 20 billion in renewable generation to replace the retiring coalfired generation capacity of schahfer generating station 

the following graph illustrates in billions the midpoint of forecasted capital investments by expected recovery period for the next three years 

regulatory capital programs we replace pipe and modernize our gas infrastructure to enhance safety and reliability by reducing leaks which subsequently reduces ghg emissions in 2021 we continued to move forward on core infrastructure and environmental investment programs supported by complementary regulatory and customer initiatives across all six states of our operating area

we expect to have capital investment requirements of approximately 20 billion primarily in 2022 and 2023 to replace the generation capacity of all rm schahfer generating stations coalfired units these investments include our portion of the joint venture obligations including construction milestone payments included in the agreements 

our expected payments include employer contributions to pension and other postretirement benefits plans expected to be made in 2022 plan contributions beyond 2022 are dependent upon a number of factors including actual returns on plan assets which cannot be reliably estimated at this time in 2022 we expect to make contributions of approximately 28 million to our pension plans and approximately 215 million to our postretirement medical and life plans refer to note 12 pension and other postretirement benefits in the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information 

we cannot reasonably estimate the settlement amounts or timing of cash flows related to certain of our longterm obligations classified as total other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets

environmental and safety matters 

phmsa regulations 

on december 27 2020 the protecting our infrastructure of pipelines and enhancing safety pipes act of 2020 was signed into law reauthorizing funding for federal pipeline safety programs through september 30 2023 among other things the pipes act requires that phmsa revise the pipeline safety regulations to require operators to update as needed their existing distribution integrity management plans emergency response plans and operation and maintenance plans the pipes act also requires phmsa to adopt new requirements for managing records and updating as necessary existing district regulator stations to eliminate common modes of failure that can lead to overpressurization phmsa must also require that operators implement and utilize advanced leak detection technologies that enable the location and categorization of all leaks that are hazardous or potentially hazardous to human safety or the environment natural gas companies including nisource and our subsidiaries may see increased costs depending on how phmsa implements the new mandates resulting from the pipes act 

climate change issues 

increased frequency of severe and extreme weather events associated with climate change could materially impact our facilities energy sales and results of operations we are unable to predict these events however we perform ongoing assessments of physical risk including physical climate risk to our business more extreme and volatile temperatures increased storm intensity and flooding and more volatile precipitation leading to changes in lake and river levels are among the weather events that are most likely to impact our business efforts to mitigate these physical risks continue to be implemented on an ongoing basis 

future legislative and regulatory programs at both the federal and state levels could significantly limit allowed ghg emissions or impose a cost or tax on ghg emissions revised or additional future ghg legislation andor regulation related to the generation of electricity or the extraction production distribution transmission storage and end use of natural gas could materially impact our gas supply financial position financial results and cash flows we continue to monitor the implementation of final and proposed legislation and regulations including the infrastructure investment and jobs act build

back better legislation and the epas proposed methane regulations for the oil and natural gas industry but we cannot predict their final form or impact on our business at this time 

on july 8 2019 the epa published the final ace rule which establishes emission guidelines for states to use when developing plans to limit carbon dioxide at coalfired electric generating units based on heat rate improvement measures the us court of appeals for the dc circuit vacated and remanded the rule on january 19 2021 on october 29 2021 the us supreme court agreed to review the scope of the epa’s authority to impose ghg emission standards under the clean air act we will continue to monitor this matter 

in february 2021 the united states rejoined the paris agreement an international treaty through which parties set nationally determined contributions to reduce ghg emissions build resilience and adapt to the impacts of climate change subsequently the biden administration released a target for the united states to achieve a 5052 ghg reduction from 2005 levels by 2030 which supports the presidents goals to create a carbonfree power sector by 2035 and net zero emissions economy no later than 2050 there are many pathways to reach these goals 

in 2021 the maryland commission of climate change published a building energy transition plan policy recommendations included in this plan such as the adoption of an allelectric construction code are supported by the commission but do not necessarily reflect current state policy the report is intended to guide maryland policy makers on decisions related to reducing ghg emissions from buildings in pursuit of achieving targets in marylands 2030 greenhouse gas reduction act plan and the commissions recommendation that maryland achieve netzero emissions by 2045 columbia of maryland will continue to monitor this matter but we cannot predict its final impact on our business at this time 

in response to these transition risks we continue to actively implement our plans to reduce scope 1 ghg emissions by 90 from 2005 levels by 2030 and to significantly reduce methane emissions a component of scope 1 ghg emissions these plans include the retirement of coalfired electric generation increased sourcing of renewable energy and methane reductions from priority pipeline replacement traditional leak detection and repair and deployment of advanced leak detection and repair as discussed above in this managements discussion within results and discussion of segment operations  electric operations nipsco continues to execute on an electric generation transition consistent with the preferred pathways identified in its 2018 and 2021 integrated resource plans we expect to have capital investment requirements of approximately 20 billion primarily in 2022 and 2023 to replace the generation capacity previously supplied by rm schahfer we continue to expect to retire michigan city generating station between 2026 and 2028 the preferred path of the 2021 integrated resource plan outlined new generation investments estimated to be up to 750 million and we are currently evaluating future projects in line with the preferred path 

additionally we are active in several efforts to accelerate the development and demonstration of lowercarbon energy technologies and resources such as hydrogen and renewable natural gas rng to enable affordable pathways to economywide decarbonization 

market risk disclosures 

risk is an inherent part of our businesses the extent to which we properly and effectively identify assess monitor and manage each of the various types of risk involved in our businesses is critical to our profitability we seek to identify assess monitor and manage in accordance with defined policies and procedures the following principal market risks that are involved in our businesses commodity price risk interest rate risk and credit risk we manage risk through a multifaceted process with oversight by the risk management committee that requires constant communication judgment and knowledge of specialized products and markets our senior management takes an active role in the risk management process and has developed policies and procedures that require specific administrative and business functions to assist in the identification assessment and control of various risks these may include but are not limited to market operational financial compliance and strategic risk types in recognition of the increasingly varied and complex nature of the energy business our risk management process policies and procedures continue to evolve and are subject to ongoing review and modification 

commodity price risk 

our gas and electric operations have commodity price risk primarily related to the purchases of natural gas and power to manage this market risk our subsidiaries use derivatives including commodity futures contracts swaps forwards and options we do not participate in speculative energy trading activity 

commodity price risk resulting from derivative activities at our rateregulated subsidiaries is limited and does not bear signification exposure to earnings risk since regulations allow recovery of prudently incurred purchased power fuel and gas

costs through the ratemaking process including gains or losses on these derivative instruments these changes are included in the gca and fac regulatory raterecovery mechanisms if these mechanisms were to be adjusted or eliminated these subsidiaries may begin providing services without the benefit of the traditional ratemaking process and may be more exposed to commodity price risk 

our subsidiaries are required to make cash margin deposits with their brokers to cover actual and potential losses in the value of outstanding exchange traded derivative contracts the amount of these deposits some of which is reflected in our restricted cash balance may fluctuate significantly during periods of high volatility in the energy commodity markets 

refer to note 10 risk management activities in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information on our commodity price risk assets and liabilities as of december 31 2021 and 2020 

interest rate risk 

we are exposed to interest rate risk as a result of changes in interest rates on borrowings under our revolving credit agreement commercial paper program and accounts receivable programs which have interest rates that are indexed to shortterm market interest rates based upon average borrowings and debt obligations subject to fluctuations in shortterm market interest rates an increase or decrease in shortterm interest rates of 100 basis points 1 would have increased or decreased interest expense by 31 million and 123 million for 2021 and 2020 respectively we are also exposed to interest rate risk as a result of changes in benchmark rates that can influence the interest rates of future debt issuances from time to time we may enter into forward interest rate instruments to lock in long term interest costs and or rates 

refer to note 10 risk management activities in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information on our interest rate risk assets and liabilities as of december 31 2021 and 2020   

credit risk 

due to the nature of the industry credit risk is embedded in many of our business activities our extension of credit is governed by a corporate credit risk policy in addition our risk management committee has put guidelines in place which document management approval levels for credit limits evaluation of creditworthiness and credit risk mitigation efforts exposures to credit risks are monitored by the risk management function which is independent of commercial operations credit risk arises due to the possibility that a customer supplier or counterparty will not be able or willing to fulfill its obligations on a transaction on or before the settlement date for derivativerelated contracts credit risk arises when counterparties are obligated to deliver or purchase defined commodity units of gas or power to us at a future date per execution of contractual terms and conditions exposure to credit risk is measured in terms of both current obligations and the market value of forward positions net of any posted collateral such as cash and letters of credit 

we closely monitor the financial status of our banking credit providers we evaluate the financial status of our banking partners through the use of marketbased metrics such as credit default swap pricing levels and also through traditional credit ratings provided by major credit rating agencies 

certain individual state regulatory commissions instituted regulatory moratoriums in connection with the covid19 pandemic that impacted our ability to pursue our credit risk mitigation practices for customer accounts receivable following the issuances of these moratoriums certain of our regulated operations have been authorized to recognize a regulatory asset for bad debt costs above levels currently in rates we have now resumed our common credit mitigation practices in all jurisdictions as these moratoriums have expired see the covid19 discussion in part i item 1a risk factors for risks that have been identified related to the pandemic and refer to note 9 regulatory matters in the notes to consolidated financial statements for state specific regulatory moratoriums

critical accounting policies and estimates 

we apply certain accounting policies in accordance with gaap which require that we make estimates and judgments that have had and may continue to have significant impacts on our operations and consolidated financial statements we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates we believe the following represent the more significant items requiring the use of judgment in preparing our consolidated financial statements 

item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued

basis of accounting for rateregulated subsidiaries asc topic 980 regulated operations  provides that rateregulated subsidiaries account for and report assets and liabilities consistent with the economic effect of the way in which regulators establish rates if the rates established are designed to recover the costs of providing the regulated service and if the competitive environment makes it probable that such rates can be charged and collected certain expenses and credits subject to utility regulation or rate determination normally reflected in income are deferred on the consolidated balance sheets and are recognized in income as the related amounts are included in service rates and recovered from or refunded to customers the total amounts of regulatory assets and liabilities reflected on the consolidated balance sheets were 24922 million and 19800 million at december 31 2021 and 19305 million and 20655 million at december 31 2020 respectively for additional information refer to note 9 “regulatory matters” in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

in the event that regulation significantly changes the opportunity for us to recover our costs in the future all or a portion of our regulated operations may no longer meet the criteria for the application of asc topic 980 regulated operations  in such event a writedown of all or a portion of our existing regulatory assets and liabilities could result if transition cost recovery is approved by the appropriate regulatory bodies that would meet the requirements under gaap for continued accounting as regulatory assets and liabilities during such recovery period the regulatory assets and liabilities would be reported at the recoverable amounts if we were unable to continue to apply the provisions of asc topic 980 regulated operations  we would be required to apply the provisions of asc topic 98020 discontinuation of rateregulated accounting  in management’s opinion our regulated subsidiaries will be subject to asc topic 980 regulated operations for the foreseeable future 

certain of the regulatory assets reflected on our consolidated balance sheets require specific regulatory action in order to be included in future service rates although recovery of these amounts is not guaranteed we believe that these costs meet the requirements for deferral as regulatory assets if we determine that the amounts included as regulatory assets are no longer recoverable a charge to income would immediately be required to the extent of the unrecoverable amounts 

one of the more significant items recorded through the application of this accounting guidance is the regulatory overlay for jv accounting the application of hlbv to consolidated vies generally results in the recognition of profit from the related joint ventures over a time frame that is different from when the regulatory return is earned in accordance with the principles of asc 980 we have recognized a regulatory deferral of certain amounts representing the timing difference between the profit earned from the joint ventures and the amount included in regulated rates to recover our approved investments in consolidated joint ventures for additional information refer to note 1s vies and allocation of earnings in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

equity unit transactions we record the series c mandatory convertible preferred stock and forward purchase contracts that comprise the corporate units as a single unit of account and classify the corporate units as equity under the provisions of asc 480 and asc 815 significant judgments regarding the economic linkage between the preferred stock and the forward purchase contracts as well as the substance of the terms and conditions of the corporate units were required by management in making these determinations 

the initial classification of the corporate units whether viewed as a single unit of account or as two freestanding financial instruments would affect our financial results if determined to be two units of account the forward purchase contracts underlying the corporate units would be classified as a derivative and result in impacts to net income through the recognition of interest expense and marktomarket adjustments if determined to be one unit of accountthe equity classification of the corporate units would have no material impact on net income each classification has differing impacts to the numerator in the computation of eps 

we consider that there are a small number of similar equity hosted unit structures and that our unit structure is unique we also consider that the provisions of asc 480 and asc 815 that govern the determination of unit of account are highly complex and that alternate conclusions reached under this guidance would result in materially different financial results see note 13 equity in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional details of the equity unit transaction 

pension and postretirement benefits we have defined benefit plans for both pension and other postretirement benefits the calculation of the net obligations and annual expense related to the plans requires a significant degree of judgment regarding the discount rates to be used in bringing the liabilities to present value expected longterm rates of return on plan assets health care trend rates and mortality rates among other assumptions due to the size of the plans and the longterm nature of the associated liabilities changes in the assumptions used in the actuarial estimates could have material impacts on the measurement of the net obligations and annual expense recognition differences between actuarial assumptions and actual plan results are deferred into

aoci or a regulatory balance sheet account depending on the jurisdiction of our entity these deferred gains or losses are then amortized into the income statement when the accumulated differences exceed 10 of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or the fair value of plan assets known in gaap as the “corridor” method or when settlement accounting is triggered 

the discount rates expected longterm rates of return on plan assets health care cost trend rates and mortality rates are critical assumptions methods used to develop these assumptions are described below while a third party actuarial firm assists with the development of many of these assumptions we are ultimately responsible for selecting the final assumptions 

the discount rate is utilized principally in calculating the actuarial present value of pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit plan costs our discount rates for both pension and other postretirement benefits are determined using spot rates along an aarated above median yield curve with cash flows matching the expected duration of benefit payments to be made to plan participants 

the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets is a component utilized in calculating annual pension and other postretirement benefit plan costs we estimate the expected return on plan assets by evaluating expected bond returns equity risk premiums target asset allocations the effects of active plan management the impact of periodic plan asset rebalancing and historical performance we also consider the guidance from our investment advisors in making a final determination of our expected rate of return on assets for measurement of 2021 net periodic benefit cost we selected an expected pretax longterm rate of return of 520 and 550 for our pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets respectively 

we estimate the assumed health care cost trend rate which is used in determining our other postretirement benefit net expense based upon our actual health care cost experience the effects of recently enacted legislation thirdparty actuarial surveys and general economic conditions 

we utilize a full yield curve approach to estimate the service and interest components of net periodic benefit cost for pension and other postretirement benefits by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows for further discussion of our pension and other postretirement benefits see note 12 “pension and other postretirement benefits” in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

typically we use the society of actuaries’ most recently published mortality data in developing a best estimate of mortality as part of the calculation of the pension and other postretirement benefit obligations due to the ongoing covid19 pandemic we adjusted our mortality assumption through 2023 to reflect anticipated slow recovery 

the following tables illustrate the effects of changes in these actuarial assumptions while holding all other assumptions constant

goodwill and other intangible assets we have six goodwill reporting units comprised of the six state operating companies within the gas distribution operations reportable segment our goodwill assets at december 31 2021 were 1486 million most of which resulted from the acquisition of columbia on november 1 2000 

as required by gaap we test for impairment of goodwill on an annual basis and on an interim basis when events or circumstances indicate that a potential impairment may exist our annual goodwill test takes place in the second quarter of each year and was performed on may 1 2021 a qualitative step 0 test was completed on may 1 2021 for all reporting units in the step 0 analysis we assessed various assumptions events and circumstances that would have affected the estimated fair value of the applicable reporting units as compared to their baseline may 1 2020 step 1 fair value measurement the results of this assessment indicated that it was more likely than not that the estimated fair value of the reporting unit substantially exceeded the related carrying value of our reporting unit therefore no step 1 analysis was required and no impairment charges were indicated since the annual evaluation there have been no indications that the fair values of the goodwill reporting units have decreased below the carrying values 

as noted above application of the qualitative goodwill impairment test requires evaluating various events and circumstances to determine whether it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount although we believe all relevant factors were considered in the qualitative impairment analysis to reach the conclusion that goodwill is not impaired significant changes in any one of the assumptions could potentially result in the recording of an impairment that could have significant impacts on the consolidated financial statements 

see note 7 goodwill and other intangible assets in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 

unbilled revenue we record utility operating revenues when energy is delivered to our customers however the determination of energy sales to individual customers is based upon the reading of their meters which occurs on a systematic basis throughout the month at the end of each month amounts of energy delivered to customers since the date of their last meter reading are estimated and corresponding unbilled revenues are calculated this unbilled revenue is estimated each month based upon historical usage customer rates and weather significant fluctuations in energy demand for the unbilled period or changes in the composition of customer classes could impact the accuracy of the unbilled revenue estimate refer to note 3 revenue recognition in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our significant judgments and estimates related to unbilled revenue recognition 

income taxes the consolidated income tax provision and deferred income tax assets and liabilities as well as any unrecognized tax benefits and valuation allowances require use of estimates and significant management judgement although we believe that current estimates for deferred tax assets and liabilities are reasonable actual results could differ from these estimates for a variety of reasons including reasonable projections of taxable income the ability and intent to implement tax planning strategies if necessary and interpretations of applicable tax laws and regulations across multiple taxing jurisdictions ultimate resolution or clarification of income tax matters may result in favorable or unfavorable impacts to net income and cash flows and adjustments to taxrelated assets and liabilities could be material 

we account for uncertain income tax positions using a benefit recognition model with a twostep approach including a morelikelythannot recognition threshold and a measurement approach based on the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50 likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement we evaluate each position based solely on the technical merits and facts and circumstances of the position assuming the position will be examined by a taxing authority having full knowledge of all relevant information significant judgment is required to determine whether the recognition threshold has been met and if so the appropriate amount of tax benefits to be recorded in the consolidated financial statements at december 31 2021 we had 217 million of unrecognized tax benefits changes in these unrecognized tax benefits may result from remeasurement of amounts expected to be realized settlements with tax authorities and expiration of statutes of limitations 

valuation allowances against deferred tax assets are recorded when we conclude it is more likely than not such asset will not be realized in future periods accounting for income taxes also requires that only tax benefits for positions taken or expected to be taken on tax returns that meet the morelikelythannot recognition threshold can be recognized or continue to be recognized we evaluate each position solely on the technical merits and facts and circumstances of the position assuming that the position will be examined by a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information significant judgment is required to determine recognition thresholds and the related amount of tax benefits to be recognized at december 31 2021 we had established 78 million of valuation allowances related to certain state nol carryforwards refer to note 11 income taxes in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information

nisource’s principal subsidiaries include nisource gas distribution group inc a natural gas distribution holding company and nipsco a gas and electric company nisource derives substantially all of its revenues and earnings from the operating results of these rateregulated businesses 

on february 26 2020 nisource and columbia of massachusetts entered into an asset purchase agreement with eversource the asset purchase agreement upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the asset purchase agreement nisource and columbia of massachusetts agreed to sell to eversource with certain additions and exceptions 1 substantially all of the assets of columbia of massachusetts and 2 all of the assets held by any of columbia of massachusetts’ affiliates that primarily relate to the massachusetts business and 3 eversource agreed to assume certain liabilities of columbia of massachusetts and its affiliates the closing of the transaction occurred on october 9 2020 refer to note 1a company structure and principles of consolidation note 7 goodwill and other intangible assets note 20c legal proceedings and note 20e other matters in the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information

business strategy 

we focus our business strategy on providing safe and reliable service through our core rateregulated assetbased utilities which generate substantially all of our operating income our utilities continue to move forward on core safety infrastructure and environmental investment programs supported by complementary regulatory and customer initiatives across all six states in which we operate our goal is to develop strategies that benefit all stakeholders as we i address changing customer conservation patterns ii align our price structures with our cost structure and iii embark on longterm investment programs these strategies focus on improving safety and reliability enhancing customer service lowering customer bills and reducing emissions while generating sustainable returns 

the safety of our customers communities and employees remains our top priority the sms transitioned in 2020 from an accelerated project launch to an established operating model within nisource with the continued support and advice from the quality review board a panel of third parties with safety operations expertise engaged by management to advise on safety matters we are continuing to mature our sms processes capabilities and talent as we collaborate within and across industries to enhance safety and reduce operational risk 

in its 2018 integrated resource plan submission to the iurc nipsco laid out a plan to retire the rm schahfer generating station by 2023 and michigan city generating station by 2028 these units represent 72 of nipsco’s remaining generation capacity the current replacement plan includes renewable sources of energy including wind solar and battery storage to be obtained through a combination of nipsco investment and ppas refer to note 20e other matters in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of these plans

competition and changes in the regulatory environment 

the regulatory frameworks applicable to our operations including environmental regulations at both the state and federal levels continue to evolve these changes have had and will continue to have an impact on our operations structure and profitability management continually seeks new ways to be more competitive and profitable in this environment we believe we are in all material respects in compliance with such laws and regulations and do not expect continued compliance to have a material impact on our capital expenditures earnings or competitive position we continue to monitor existing and pending laws and regulations and the impact of regulatory changes cannot be predicted with certainty refer to note 20d environmental matters in the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information regarding environmental regulations that are applicable to our operations 

the gas distribution operations utilities have pursued nontraditional revenue sources within the evolving natural gas marketplace these efforts include i the sale of products and services upstream of the companies’ service territory ii the sale of products and services in the companies’ service territories and iii gas supply cost incentive mechanisms for service to their core markets the upstream products are made up of transactions that occur between an individual gas distribution operations utility and a buyer for the sales of unbundled or rebundled gas supply and capacity the onsystem services are offered by us to customers and include products such as the transportation and balancing of gas on the gas distribution operations utilitys system the incentive mechanisms give the gas distribution operations utilities an opportunity to share in the savings created from such situations as gas purchase prices paid below an agreed upon benchmark and their ability to reduce pipeline capacity charges with their customers 

increased efficiency of natural gas appliances and improvements in home building codes and standards has contributed to a longterm trend of declining average use per customer while historical rate design at the distribution level has been structured such that a large portion of cost recovery is based upon throughput rather than in a fixed charge operating costs are largely incurred on a fixed basis and do not fluctuate due to changes in customer usage as a result gas distribution operations have pursued changes in rate design to more effectively match recoveries with costs incurred each of the states in which gas distribution operations operate has different requirements regarding the procedure for establishing changes to rate design columbia of ohio has adopted a decoupled rate design that closely links the recovery of fixed costs with fixed charges columbia of maryland and columbia of virginia have regulatory approval for weather and revenue normalization adjustments for certain customer classes which adjust monthly revenues that exceed or fall short of approved levels columbia of pennsylvania continues to operate its pilot residential weather normalization adjustment columbia of kentucky incorporates a weather normalization adjustment in a prior gas base rate proceeding nipsco implemented a higher fixed customer charge for residential and small customer classes moving toward recovering more of its fixed costs through a fixed recovery charge but has no weather or usage protection mechanism 

cost recovery and trackers comparability of our line item operating results are impacted by regulatory trackers that allow for the future recovery in rates of certain costs as described below increases in expenses that are the subject to approved regulatory tracker mechanisms generally lead to increased regulatory assets which ultimately result in a corresponding increase in operating revenues and therefore have essentially no impact on total operating income results certain approved regulatory tracker mechanisms allow for abbreviated regulatory proceedings in order for the operating companies to quickly implement revised rates and recover associated costs 

a portion of the gas distribution revenue is related to the recovery of gas costs the review and recovery of which occurs through standard regulatory proceedings all states in our operating area require periodic review of actual gas procurement activity to determine prudence and confirm the recovery of prudently incurred energy commodity costs supplied to customers 

a portion of the electric operations revenue is related to the recovery of fuel costs to generate power and the fuel costs related to purchased power these costs are recovered through a fac which is updated quarterly to reflect actual costs incurred to supply electricity to customers 

natural gas competition  open access to natural gas supplies over interstate pipelines and the deregulation of the gas supply has led to tremendous change in the energy markets ldc customers can purchase gas directly from producers and marketers in an open competitive market this separation or “unbundling” of the transportation and other services offered by ldcs allows customers to purchase the commodity independent of services provided by ldcs ldcs continue to purchase gas and recover the associated costs from their customers our gas distribution operations’ subsidiaries are involved in programs that provide customers the opportunity to purchase their natural gas requirements from third parties and use our gas distribution operations’ subsidiaries for transportation services

n i s ource i nc  

gas distribution operations competes with i investorowned municipal and cooperative electric utilities throughout its service areas ii other regulated and unregulated natural gas intra and interstate pipelines and iii other alternate fuels such as propane and fuel oil gas distribution operations continues to be a strong competitor in the energy market as a result of strong customer preference for natural gas competition with providers of electricity has traditionally been the strongest in the residential and commercial markets of kentucky southern ohio central pennsylvania and western virginia due to comparatively low electric rates 

electric competition  indiana electric utilities generally have exclusive service areas under indiana regulations and retail electric customers in indiana do not have the ability to choose their electric supplier nipsco faces nonutility competition from other energy sources such as selfgeneration by large industrial customers and other distributed energy sources   

seasonality 

a significant portion of our operations are subject to seasonal fluctuations in sales during the heating and cooling seasons revenues from gas and electric sales respectively are more significant than in other months the heating season is primarily from november through march and the cooling season is primarily from june through september 

human capital 

human capital goals and objectives  we have aligned our human capital goals to achieve the overall company objectives by driving an enhanced talent strategy elevating support for frontline leaders fostering a culture of rigor and accountability and strengthening our human resources function as a whole 

workforce composition  as of december 31 2020 we had 7301 fulltime and 88 parttime employees 2728 employees were subject to collective bargaining agreements with various labor unions six of these agreements covering 527 employees are set to expire within one year 

diversity  our talent acquisition teams hired 612 external candidates in 2020 across all business segments 35 of external hires were female and 18 were racially or ethnically diverse in 2020 we engaged with communitybased organizations conducted career interest workshops in local schools and focused our employee mentorship program on females we also led a separate targeted development program for select employees to support the growth and development of female and ethnically diverse talent we offered several employee resource groups “ergs” and hosted mostly virtual activities throughout 2020 we have ergs set up to support africanamerican latinx veterans lgbtq female and asian employees among others and held several sponsored conversations between senior executives and the ergs

we may not be able to execute our business plan or growth strategy including utility infrastructure investments 

business or regulatory conditions may result in us not being able to execute our business plan or growth strategy including identified planned and other utility infrastructure investments which includes investments related to natural gas pipeline modernization and investments related to our renewable energy projects and the buildtransfer execution goals within our business plan our “nisource next” initiative a comprehensive program designed to identify longterm sustainable capability enhancements and cost optimization improvements may not be effective our customer and regulatory initiatives may not achieve planned results utility infrastructure investments may not materialize may cease to be achievable or economically viable and may not be successfully completed natural gas may cease to be viewed as an economically and environmentally attractive fuel environmental activist groups investors and governmental entities may continue to oppose natural gas delivery and infrastructure investments in the jurisdictions where we operate because of perceived environmental impacts associated with the natural gas supply chain and end use energy conservation energy efficiency distributed generation energy storage policies favoring electric heat over gas heat and other factors may reduce demand for natural gas and energy in addition we consider acquisitions or dispositions of assets or businesses joint ventures and mergers from time to time as we execute on our business plan and growth strategy any of these circumstances could adversely affect our results of operations and growth prospects even if our business plan and growth strategy are executed there is still risk of among other things human error in maintenance installation or operations shortages or delays in obtaining equipment and performance below expected levels in addition to the other risks discussed in this section 

our gas distribution and transmission activities as well as generation transmission and distribution of electricity involve a variety of inherent hazards and operating risks including potential public safety risks 

our gas distribution and transmission activities as well as generation transmission and distribution of electricity involve a variety of inherent hazards and operating risks including but not limited to gas leaks and overpressurization downed power lines excavation or vehicular damage to our infrastructure outages environmental spills mechanical problems and other incidents which could cause substantial financial losses as demonstrated in part by the greater lawrence incident in addition these hazards and risks have resulted and may in the future result in serious injury or loss of life to employees andor the general public significant damage to property environmental pollution impairment of our operations adverse regulatory rulings and reputational harm which in turn could lead to substantial losses for us the location of pipeline facilities including regulator stations liquefied natural gas and underground storage or generation transmission substation and distribution facilities near populated areas including residential areas commercial business centers and industrial sites could increase the level of damages resulting from such incidents as with the greater lawrence incident certain incidents have subjected and may in the future subject us to litigation or administrative or other legal proceedings from time to time both civil and criminal which could result in substantial monetary judgments fines or penalties against us be resolved on unfavorable terms and require us to incur significant operational expenses the occurrence of incidents has in certain instances adversely affected and could in the future adversely affect our reputation cash flows financial position andor results of operations we maintain insurance against some but not all of these risks and losses 

failure to adapt to advances in technology and manage the related costs could make us less competitive and negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition 

a key element of our business model includes generating power at central station power plants to achieve economies of scale and produce power at a competitive cost we continue to research plan for and implement new technologies that produce reliable costefficient power or reduce power consumption these technologies include renewable energy distributed generation energy storage and energy efficiency advances in technology changes in laws or regulations including subsidization and other alternative methods of producing power are reducing the cost of electric generation from these sources to a level that is competitive with most central station power electric production this could cause power sales to decline and the value of our generating facilities to decline new technologies may require us to make significant expenditures to remain competitive and may result in the obsolescence of certain operating assets 

our natural gas business model leverages widespread utilization of natural gas for space heating as a core driver of revenues alternative energy sources new technologies or alternatives to natural gas space heating including cold climate heat pumps andor efficiency of other products could reduce demand and increase customer attrition which would impact our ability to recover on our investments in our gas distribution assets 

item 1a risk factors 

n i s ource i nc  

in addition customers are increasingly expecting additional communications increased access to information and expanded electronic capabilities regarding their electric and natural gas services which in some cases involves additional investments in technology we also rely on technology to adequately maintain key business records 

our future success will depend in part on our ability to anticipate and successfully adapt to technological changes to offer services that meet customer demands and evolving industry standards and to recover all or a significant portion of any unrecovered investment in obsolete assets a failure by us to effectively adapt to changes in technology and manage the related costs could harm our ability to remain competitive in the marketplace for our products services and processes and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition 

aging infrastructure may lead to disruptions in operations and increased capital expenditures and maintenance costs all of which could negatively impact our financial results 

we have risks associated with aging infrastructure including our electric and gas infrastructure assets these risks can be driven by threats such as but not limited to electrical faults mechanical failure internal corrosion external corrosion ground movement and stress corrosion andor cracking the age of these assets may result in a need for replacement a higher level of maintenance costs or unscheduled outages despite efforts by us to properly maintain or upgrade these assets through inspection scheduled maintenance and capital investment in addition the nature of the information available on aging infrastructure assets which in some cases is incomplete may make inspections maintenance upgrading and replacement of the assets particularly challenging missing or incorrect infrastructure data may lead to 1 difficulty properly locating facilities which can result in excavator damage and operational or emergency response issues and 2 configuration and control risks associated with the modification of system operating pressures in connection with turning off or turning on service to customers which can result in unintended outages or operating pressures also additional maintenance and inspections are required in some instances in order to improve infrastructure information and records and address emerging regulatory or risk management requirements which increases our costs the failure to operate these assets as desired could result in interruption of electric service major component failure at generating facilities and electric substations gas leaks and other incidents and in our inability to meet firm service obligations which could adversely impact revenues and could also result in increased capital expenditures and maintenance costs which if not fully recovered from customers could negatively impact our financial results 

we may be unable to obtain insurance on acceptable terms or at all and the insurance coverage we do obtain may not provide protection against all significant losses 

our ability to obtain insurance as well as the cost and coverage of such insurance are affected by developments affecting our business international national state or local events and the financial condition and underwriting considerations of insurers for example some insurers are moving away from underwriting certain energy related businesses such as those in the coal industry or those exposed to certain perils such as wildfires as well as gas explosion events or other infrastructurerelated risks the utility insurance market is experiencing a hardening environment due to reductions in commercial suppliers and the capacity they are willing to issue increases in overall demand for capacity and a prevalence of severe losses we have not been able to obtain liability insurance coverage at previously procured limits at rates that are acceptable to us insurance coverage may not continue to be available at limits rates or terms acceptable to us the premiums we pay for our insurance coverage have significantly increased as a result of market conditions and the accumulated loss ratio over the history of our operations and we expect that they will continue to increase as a result of hardening in market conditions in addition our insurance is not sufficient or effective under all circumstances and against all hazards or liabilities to which we are subject for example total expenses related to the greater lawrence incident exceeded the total amount of liability coverage available under our policies certain types of damages expenses or claimed costs such as fines and penalties have been and in the future may be excluded under the policies in addition insurers providing insurance to us may raise defenses to coverage under the terms and conditions of the respective insurance policies that could result in a denial of coverage or limit the amount of insurance proceeds available to us any losses for which we are not fully insured or that are not covered by insurance at all could materially adversely affect our results of operations cash flows and financial position 

the implementation of nipsco’s electric generation strategy including the retirement of its coal generation units may not achieve intended results 

our plan to replace 80 of our coal generation capacity by mid2023 and all of our coal generation by the end of 2028 with primarily renewable resources may not progress as anticipated on october 31 2018 nipsco submitted its 2018 integrated resource plan with the iurc setting forth its short and longterm electric generation plans in an effort to maintain affordability while providing reliable flexible and cleaner sources of power the integrated resource plan evaluated demandside and supplyside resource alternatives to meet nipsco customers future energy requirements over the ensuing 20 years

the preferred option within the integrated resource plan retires the rm schahfer generating station by mid2023 and the michigan city generating station by the end of 2028 these stations represent 2080 mw of generating capacity equal to 72 of nipsco’s remaining generating capacity and 100 of nipscos remaining coalfired generating capacity the current replacement plan includes renewable sources of energy including wind solar and battery storage in the second quarter of 2020 the miso approved nipscos plan to retire the rm schahfer generating station in 2023 in february 2021 nipsco decided to submit modified attachment y notices to miso requesting accelerated retirement of two of the four units at rm schahfer generating station the two units are now expected to be retired by the end of 2021 with the remaining two units still scheduled to be retired in 2023 refer to note 20 e other matters  nipsco 2018 integrated resource plan in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 

there are inherent risks and uncertainties in executing the integrated resource plan including changes in market conditions regulatory approvals environmental regulations commodity costs and customer expectations which may impede nipsco’s ability to achieve the intended results nipsco’s future success will depend in part on its ability to successfully implement its longterm electric generation plans to offer services that meet customer demands and evolving industry standards and to recover all or a significant portion of any unrecovered investment in obsolete assets nipsco’s electric generation strategy could require significant future capital expenditures operating costs and charges to earnings that may negatively impact our financial position financial results and cash flows as required by statute nipsco plans to submit a new integrated resource plan to the iurc by november 1 2021 this submission will again outline nipscos short and long term plans for meeting the energy supply needs of its customers taking into account current perspectives on a range of factors including but not limited to new state and federal policy wholesale market rules forecasted customer demand and available resource alternativesthe analysis conclusions and preferred plan in the 2021 integrated resource plan may be different from the analysis conclusions and preferred plan in the 2018 integrated resource plan 

our capital projects and programs subject us to construction risks and natural gas costs and supply risks and are subject to regulatory oversight including requirements for permits approvals and certificates from various governmental agencies 

our business requires substantial capital expenditures for investments in among other things capital improvements to our electric generating facilities electric and natural gas distribution infrastructure natural gas storage and other projects including projects for environmental compliance we are engaged in intrastate natural gas pipeline modernization programs to maintain system integrity and enhance service reliability and flexibility nipsco also is currently engaged in a number of capital projects including environmental improvements to its electric generating stations the construction of new transmission facilities and new projects related to renewable energy as we undertake these projects and programs we may be unable to complete them on schedule or at the anticipated costs additionally we may construct or purchase some of these projects and programs to capture anticipated future growth in natural gas production which may not materialize and may cause the construction to occur over an extended period of time 

our existing and planned capital projects require numerous permits approvals and certificates from federal state and local governmental agencies if there is a delay in obtaining any required regulatory approvals or if we fail to obtain or maintain any required approvals or to comply with any applicable laws or regulations we may not be able to construct or operate our facilities we may be forced to incur additional costs or we may be unable to recover any or all amounts invested in a project we also may not receive the anticipated increases in revenue and cash flows resulting from such projects and programs until after their completion other construction risks include changes in costs of materials equipment commodities or labor including changes to tariffs on materials delays caused by construction incidents or injuries work stoppages shortages in qualified labor poor initial cost estimates unforeseen engineering issues the ability to obtain necessary rightsofway easements and transmissions connections and general contractors and subcontractors not performing as required under their contracts 

on may 1 2020 former president donald trump issued an executive order the “eo” prohibiting any transaction initiated after that day that i involves bulkpower system “bps” equipment designed developed manufactured or supplied by persons owned by controlled by or subject to the jurisdiction or direction of a foreign adversary and ii poses an unacceptable risk to national security implementing regulations from the us secretary of energy are still pending the eo also requires the us secretary of energy to review the risk of existing bulkpower system equipment sourced from foreign adversaries and to establish a task force to review and recommend federal procurement policies and procedures consistent with the considerations identified in the eo on july 8 2020 the us department of energy issued a request for information “rfi” seeking input from industry stakeholders to “understand the energy industry’s current practices to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities in the supply chain” for components of bulkpower system equipment the rfi identifies the following governments as “foreign adversaries” china cuba iran north korea russia and venezuela the rfi notes that the us secretary of energy retains

to the extent that delays occur costs become unrecoverable or we otherwise become unable to effectively manage and complete our capital projects our results of operations cash flows and financial condition may be adversely affected 

a significant portion of the gas and electricity we sell is used by residential and commercial customers for heating and air conditioning accordingly fluctuations in weather gas and electricity commodity costs and economic conditions impact demand of our customers and our operating results 

energy sales are sensitive to variations in weather forecasts of energy sales are based on “normal” weather which represents a longterm historical average significant variations from normal weather could have and have had a material impact on energy sales additionally residential usage and to some degree commercial usage is sensitive to fluctuations in commodity costs for gas and electricity whereby usage declines with increased costs thus affecting our financial results lastly residential and commercial customers’ usage is sensitive to economic conditions and factors such as unemployment consumption and consumer confidence therefore prevailing economic conditions affecting the demand of our customers may in turn affect our financial results 

fluctuations in the price of energy commodities or their related transportation costs or an inability to obtain an adequate reliable and costeffective fuel supply to meet customer demands may have a negative impact on our financial results 

our current electric generating fleet is dependent on coal and natural gas for fuel and our gas distribution operations purchase and resell a portion of the natural gas we deliver to our customers these energy commodities are subject to price fluctuations and fluctuations in associated transportation costs when appropriate we use hedging in order to offset fluctuations in commodity supply prices we rely on regulatory recovery mechanisms in the various jurisdictions in order to fully recover the commodity costs incurred in selling energy to our customers however while we have historically been successful in the recovery of costs related to such commodity prices there can be no assurance that such costs will be fully recovered through rates in a timely manner 

in addition we depend on electric transmission lines natural gas pipelines and other transportation facilities owned and operated by third parties to deliver the electricity and natural gas we sell to wholesale markets supply natural gas to our gas storage and electric generation facilities and provide retail energy services to customers if transportation is disrupted or if capacity is inadequate we may be unable to sell and deliver our gas and electric services to some or all of our customers as a result we may be required to procure additional or alternative electricity andor natural gas supplies at thencurrent market rates which if recovery of related costs is disallowed could have a material adverse effect on our businesses financial condition cash flows results of operations andor prospects 

failure to attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce and maintain good labor relations could harm our results of operations 

we operate in an industry that requires many of our employees to possess unique technical skill sets events such as an aging workforce without appropriate replacements the mismatch of skill sets to future needs or the unavailability of contract resources may lead to operating challenges or increased costs these operating challenges include lack of resources loss of knowledge and a lengthy time period associated with skill development in addition current and prospective employees may determine that they do not wish to work for us due to market economic employment and other conditions failure to hire and retain qualified employees including the ability to transfer significant internal historical knowledge and expertise to the new employees may adversely affect our ability to manage and operate our business if we are unable to successfully attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce safety service reliability customer satisfaction and our results of operations could be adversely affected 

some of our employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements our collective bargaining agreements are generally negotiated on an operating company basis any failure to reach an agreement on new labor contracts or to negotiate these labor contracts might result in strikes boycotts or other labor disruptions labor disruptions strikes or significant negotiated wage

and benefit increases whether due to union activities employee turnover or otherwise could have a material adverse effect on our businesses results of operations andor cash flows 

if we cannot effectively manage new initiatives and organizational changes we will be unable to address the opportunities and challenges presented by our strategy and the business and regulatory environment 

in order to execute on our sustainable growth strategy and enhance our culture of ongoing continuous improvement we must effectively manage the complexity and frequency of new initiatives and organizational changes if we are unable to make decisions quickly assess our opportunities and risks and implement new governance managerial and organizational processes as needed to execute our strategy in this increasingly dynamic and competitive business and regulatory environment our financial condition results of operations and relationships with our business partners regulators customers and stockholders may be negatively impacted 

we outsource certain business functions to thirdparty suppliers and service providers and substandard performance by those third parties could harm our business reputation and results of operations 

utilities rely on extensive networks of business partners and suppliers to support critical enterprise capabilities across their organizations global metrics indicate that deliveries from suppliers are slowing and that labor shortages are occurring in the energy sector we outsource certain services to third parties in areas including construction services information technology materials fleet environmental operational services and other areas outsourcing of services to third parties could expose us to inferior service quality or substandard deliverables which may result in noncompliance including with applicable legal requirements and industry standards interruption of service or accidents or reputational harm which could negatively impact our results of operations if any difficulties in the operations of these thirdparty suppliers and service providers including their systems were to occur they could adversely affect our results of operations or adversely affect our ability to work with regulators unions customers or employees 

a cyberattack on any of our or certain thirdparty computer systems upon which we rely may adversely affect our ability to operate and could lead to a loss or misuse of confidential and proprietary information or potential liability 

we are reliant on technology to run our business which is dependent upon financial and operational computer systems to process critical information necessary to conduct various elements of our business including the generation transmission and distribution of electricity operation of our gas pipeline facilities and the recording and reporting of commercial and financial transactions to regulators investors and other stakeholders in addition to general information and cyber risks that all large corporations face eg malware unauthorized access attempts phishing attacks malicious intent by insiders thirdparty software vulnerabilities and inadvertent disclosure of sensitive information the utility industry faces evolving and increasingly complex cybersecurity risks associated with protecting sensitive and confidential customer and employee information electric grid infrastructure and natural gas infrastructure deployment of new business technologies along with maintaining legacy technology represents a largescale opportunity for attacks on our information systems and confidential customer and employee information as well as on the integrity of the energy grid and the natural gas infrastructure increasing largescale corporate attacks in conjunction with more sophisticated threats continue to challenge power and utility companies any failure of our computer systems or those of our customers suppliers or others with whom we do business could materially disrupt our ability to operate our business and could result in a financial loss and possibly do harm to our reputation 

additionally our information systems experience ongoing often sophisticated cyberattacks by a variety of sources including foreign sources with the apparent aim to breach our cyberdefenses although we attempt to maintain adequate defenses to these attacks and work through industry groups and trade associations to identify common threats and assess our countermeasures a security breach of our information systems or a security breach of the information systems of our customers suppliers or others with whom we do business could i impact the reliability of our generation transmission and distribution systems and potentially negatively impact our compliance with certain mandatory reliability standards ii subject us to reputational and other harm or liabilities associated with theft or inappropriate release of certain types of information such as system operating information or information personal or otherwise relating to our customers or employees iii impact our ability to manage our businesses andor iv subject us to legal and regulatory proceedings and claims from third parties in addition to remediation costs any of which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our businesses cash flows financial condition results of operations andor prospects although we do maintain cyber insurance it is possible that such insurance will not adequately cover any losses or liabilities we may incur as a result of a cybersecurity incident 

we are exposed to significant reputational risks which make us vulnerable to a loss of cost recovery increased litigation and negative public perception

as a utility company we are subject to adverse publicity focused on the reliability of our services the speed with which we are able to respond effectively to electric outages natural gas leaks or events and related accidents and similar interruptions caused by storm damage or other unanticipated events as well as our own or third parties actions or failure to act we are also subject to adverse publicity related to actual or perceived environmental impacts if customers legislators or regulators have or develop a negative opinion of us this could result in less favorable legislative and regulatory outcomes or increased regulatory oversight increased litigation and negative public perception the adverse publicity and investigations we experienced as a result of the greater lawrence incident may have an ongoing negative impact on the public’s perception of us it is difficult to predict the ultimate impact of this adverse publicity the foregoing may have continuing adverse effects on our business results of operations cash flow and financial condition 

the sale of the massachusetts business poses risks and challenges that could negatively impact our business and we may not realize the expected benefits of the sale of the massachusetts business 

on october 9 2020 we completed the sale of the massachusetts business to eversource the sale of the massachusetts business involves separation or carveout activities and costs and possible disputes with eversource we have continued financial liabilities with respect to the business conducted by columbia of massachusetts as we retain responsibility for and have agreed to indemnify eversource against certain liabilities this responsibility includes liabilities for any fines arising out of the greater lawrence incident and liabilities of columbia of massachusetts or its affiliates pursuant to civil claims for injury of persons or damage to property to the extent such injury or damage occurred prior to the closing in connection with the massachusetts business it may also be difficult to determine whether a claim from a third party is our responsibility and we may expend substantial resources trying to determine whether we or eversource has responsibility for the claim 

further the sale of the massachusetts business may result in a dilutive impact to our future earnings if we are unable to offset the loss of revenue associated with the sale which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

the impacts of natural disasters acts of terrorism acts of war civil unrest cyberattacks accidents public health emergencies or other catastrophic events may disrupt operations and reduce the ability to service customers 

a disruption or failure of natural gas distribution systems or within electric generation transmission or distribution systems in the event of a major hurricane tornado terrorist attack acts of war civil unrest cyberattack as further detailed above accident public health emergency pandemic or other catastrophic event could cause delays in completing sales providing services or performing other critical functions we have experienced disruptions in the past from hurricanes and tornadoes and other events of this nature also companies in our industry face a heightened risk of exposure to acts of terrorism and vandalism the occurrence of such events could adversely affect our financial position and results of operations in accordance with customary industry practice we maintain insurance against some but not all of these risks and losses 

climate change has the potential to affect our business 

our strategy may be impacted by policy and legal technology market and reputational risks and opportunities that are associated with the transition to a lowercarbon economy as disclosed in other risk factors in this section in addition climate change may exacerbate the risks to our physical infrastructure including heat stresses to power lines storms that damage infrastructure lake and sea level changes that affect the manner in which services are currently provided droughts or other stresses on water used to supply services and other extreme weather conditions climate change and the transition to a lower carbon economy have the potential to affect our business by reducing our ability to serve customers increasing the costs we incur in providing our products and services impacting the demand for and consumption of our products and services due to changes in costs technology reputation and weather patterns and affecting the economic health of the regions in which we operate changes in policy to combat climate change and technology advancement each of which can also accelerate the implications of a transition to a lower carbon economy may materially adversely impact our business financial position results of operations and cash flows 

extreme weather conditions may negatively impact our operations 

we conduct our operations across a wide geographic area subject to varied and potentially extreme weather conditions which may from time to time persist for sustained periods of time despite preventative maintenance efforts persistent weather related stress on our infrastructure may reveal weaknesses in our systems not previously known to us or otherwise present various operational challenges across all business segments further adverse weather may affect our ability to conduct operations in a manner that satisfies customer expectations or contractual obligations including by causing service disruptions

financial economic and market risks 

we have substantial indebtedness which could adversely affect our financial condition 

our business is capital intensive and we rely significantly on longterm debt to fund a portion of our capital expenditures and repay outstanding debt and on shortterm borrowings to fund a portion of daytoday business operations we had total consolidated indebtedness of 97461 million outstanding as of december 31 2020 our substantial indebtedness could have important consequences for example it could 

• limit our ability to borrow additional funds or increase the cost of borrowing additional funds 

• reduce the availability of cash flow from operations to fund working capital capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes 

• limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in the business and the industries in which we operate 

• lead parties with whom we do business to require additional credit support such as letters of credit in order for us to transact such business 

• place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to competitors that are less leveraged 

• increase vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions and 

• limit our ability to execute on our growth strategy which is dependent upon access to capital to fund our substantial infrastructure investment program 

some of our debt obligations contain financial covenants related to debttocapital ratios and crossdefault provisions our failure to comply with any of these covenants could result in an event of default which if not cured or waived could result in the acceleration of outstanding debt obligations 

a drop in our credit ratings could adversely impact our cash flows results of operation financial condition and liquidity 

the availability and cost of credit for our businesses may be greatly affected by credit ratings the credit rating agencies periodically review our ratings taking into account factors such as our capital structure earnings profile and in 2020 and 2021 the impacts of the covid19 pandemic we are committed to maintaining investment grade credit ratings however there is no assurance we will be able to do so in the future our credit ratings could be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if in its judgment the circumstances warrant any negative rating action could adversely affect our ability to access capital at rates and on terms that are attractive a negative rating action could also adversely impact our business relationships with suppliers and operating partners who may be less willing to extend credit or offer us similarly favorable terms as secured in the past under such circumstances 

certain of our subsidiaries have agreements that contain “ratings triggers” that require increased collateral in the form of cash a letter of credit or other forms of security for new and existing transactions if our credit ratings including the standalone credit ratings of certain of our subsidiaries are dropped below investment grade these agreements are primarily for insurance purposes and for the physical purchase or sale of gas or power as of december 31 2020 the collateral requirement that would be required in the event of a downgrade below the ratings trigger levels would amount to approximately 539 million in addition to agreements with ratings triggers there are other agreements that contain “adequate assurance” or “material adverse change” provisions that could necessitate additional credit support such as letters of credit and cash collateral to transact business 

if our or certain of our subsidiaries credit ratings were downgraded especially below investment grade financing costs and the principal amount of borrowings would likely increase due to the additional risk of our debt and because certain counterparties may require additional credit support as described above such amounts may be material and could adversely affect our cash flows results of operations and financial condition losing investment grade credit ratings may also result in more restrictive covenants and reduced flexibility on repayment terms in debt issuances lower share price and greater stockholder dilution from common equity issuances in addition to reputational damage within the investment community 

the novel coronavirus covid19 pandemic adversely impacts our business results of operations financial condition liquidity and cash flows 

item 1a risk factors 

n i s ource i nc  

the continued spread of covid19 has resulted in widespread impacts on the global economy and financial markets and could lead to a prolonged reduction in economic activity extended disruptions to supply chains and capital markets and reduced labor availability and productivity we have experienced lower revenues higher expenses for personal protective equipment and supplies and higher bad debt expense as a consequence of the pandemic which has negatively impacted our results of operations as of december 31 2020 our future operating results and liquidity may continue to be impacted by the pandemic but the extent of the impact remains uncertain such ongoing impact of the pandemic includes but is not limited to 

• lower revenue and cash flow resulting from the decrease in commercial and industrial gas and electric demand as businesses comply with operating restrictions and reopening plans in each state and as businesses experience negative economic impact from the pandemic potentially offset by higher residential demand 

• lower revenue and cash flow due to the continuing suspension of late payment and reconnection fees in some jurisdictions 

• a decline in revenue due to an increase in customer attrition rates as well as lower revenue growth if customer additions slow due to a prolonged economic downturn 

• a continued increase in bad debt and a decrease in cash flows resulting from the suspension of shutoffs and the inability of our customers to pay for their gas and electric service due to job loss or other factors partially offset by regulatory deferral 

• lower revenues on a prolonged basis resulting from higher customer bankruptcies predominately focused on commercial and industrial customers not able to sustain operations through the broader economic downturn 

• a continued delay in cash flows as customers utilize the more flexible payment plans we offer and 

• an increase in internal labor costs from higher overtime 

we also face the risk of not achieving operational compliance andor customer requirements because of work restrictions or unavailable employees due to the pandemic for more information regarding the items above and additional items related to the pandemic that we are evaluating and monitoring please see our discussion of these topics in part ii item 7 management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  executive summary  introduction  covid19 in this report and in our future filings with the securities and exchange commission to the extent the pandemic adversely affects our business results of operations financial condition liquidity or cash flows it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risk factors described herein the degree to which the pandemic will impact us will depend in part on future developments including the continued severity and duration of the outbreak actions that may be taken by governmental authorities and to what extent and when normal economic and operating conditions can resume 

adverse economic and market conditions including as a result of the covid19 pandemic or increases in interest rates could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations cash flows financial condition and liquidity 

deteriorating sluggish or volatile economic conditions in our operating jurisdictions could adversely impact our ability to maintain or grow our customer base and collect revenues from customers which could reduce our revenue or growth rate and increase operating costs the continued spread of covid19 has resulted in widespread impacts on the global economy and financial markets and could lead to a prolonged reduction in economic activity disruptions to supply chains and capital markets and reduced labor availability and productivity 

in connection with the pandemic certain state regulatory commissions instituted disconnection moratoriums and the suspension of collection of late payment fees deposits and reconnection fees which impacted our ability to pursue our standard credit risk mitigation practices following the issuance of these moratoriums certain of our regulated operations have been authorized to record a regulatory asset for bad debt expense above levels currently in rates while several of these moratoriums remain in place we have reinstated our common credit mitigation practices where moratoriums have expired it is possible that such moratoriums will be extended or reinstated as the pandemic continues 

in addition the pandemic has impacted our physical business operations resulting in delays in conducting certain residential work and additional costs required to comply with pandemicrelated health and safety protocols 

further we rely on access to the capital markets to finance our liquidity and longterm capital requirements including expenditures for our utility infrastructure and to comply with future regulatory requirements to the extent not satisfied by the cash flow generated by our operations we have historically relied on longterm debt and on the issuance of equity securities to 

item 1a risk factors 

n i s ource i nc  

fund a portion of our capital expenditures and repay outstanding debt and on shortterm borrowings to fund a portion of daytoday business operations successful implementation of our longterm business strategies including capital investment is dependent upon our ability to access the capital and credit markets including the banking and commercial paper markets on competitive terms and rates an economic downturn or uncertainty market turmoil changes in tax policy challenges faced by financial institutions changes in our credit ratings or a change in investor sentiment toward us or the utilities industry generally could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital or refinance debt reduced access to capital markets increased borrowing costs andor lower equity valuation levels could reduce future earnings per share and cash flows refer to note 15 “longterm debt” in the notes to consolidated financial statements for information related to outstanding longterm debt and maturities of that debt in addition any rise in interest rates may lead to higher borrowing costs which may adversely impact reported earnings cost of capital and capital holdings 

if in the future we face limits to the credit and capital markets or experience significant increases in the cost of capital or are unable to access the capital markets it could limit our ability to implement or increase the costs of implementing our business plan which in turn could materially and adversely affect our results of operations cash flows financial condition and liquidity 

most of our revenues are subject to economic regulation and are exposed to the impact of regulatory rate reviews and proceedings 

most of our revenues are subject to economic regulation at either the federal or state level as such the revenues generated by us are subject to regulatory review by the applicable federal or state authority these rate reviews determine the rates charged to customers and directly impact revenues our financial results are dependent on frequent regulatory proceedings in order to ensure timely recovery of costs and investments 

the outcomes of these proceedings are uncertain potentially lengthy and could be influenced by many factors some of which may be outside of our control including the cost of providing service the necessity of expenditures the quality of service regulatory interpretations customer intervention economic conditions and the political environment further the rate orders are subject to appeal which creates additional uncertainty as to the rates that will ultimately be allowed to be charged for services the covid19 pandemic is another factor that will continue to influence the regulatory process such as the implementation of disconnection moratoriums as discussed above and the risk of not being able to recover costs andor returns on invested capital through raising rates during a pandemic which has disproportionately impacted vulnerable customers and communities 

additionally the costs of complying with current and future changes in environmental and federal pipeline safety laws and regulations are expected to be significant and their recovery through rates will also be contingent on regulatory approval 

our business operations are subject to economic conditions in certain industries 

business operations throughout our service territories have been and may continue to be adversely affected by economic events at the national and local level where our businesses operate in particular sales to large industrial customers such as those in the steel oil refining industrial gas and related industries are impacted by economic downturns including the downturn resulting from the covid19 pandemic geographic or technological shifts in production or production methods and consumer demand for environmentally friendly products and practices the us manufacturing industry continues to adjust to changing market conditions including international competition increasing costs and fluctuating demand for its products in addition our results of operations are negatively impacted by lower revenues resulting from higher bankruptcies predominately focused on commercial and industrial customers not able to sustain operations through the economic disruptions related to the pandemic 

we are exposed to risk that customers will not remit payment for delivered energy or services and that suppliers or counterparties will not perform under various financial or operating agreements 

our extension of credit is governed by a corporate credit risk policy involves considerable judgment by our employees and is based on an evaluation of a customer or counterparty’s financial condition credit history and other factors we monitor our credit risk exposure by obtaining credit reports and updated financial information for customers and suppliers and by evaluating the financial status of our banking partners and other counterparties by reference to marketbased metrics such as credit default swap pricing levels and to traditional credit ratings provided by the major credit rating agencies adverse economic conditions result in an increase in defaults by customers suppliers and counterparties as stated above in connection with the covid19 pandemic certain state regulatory commissions instituted regulatory moratoriums that have impacted our ability to pursue our standard credit risk mitigation practices

we are a holding company and are dependent on cash generated by our subsidiaries to meet our debt obligations and pay dividends on our stock 

we are a holding company and conduct our operations primarily through our subsidiaries which are separate and distinct legal entities substantially all of our consolidated assets are held by our subsidiaries accordingly our ability to meet our debt obligations or pay dividends on our common stock and preferred stock is largely dependent upon cash generated by these subsidiaries in the event a major subsidiary is not able to pay dividends or transfer cash flows to us our ability to service our debt obligations or pay dividends could be negatively affected 

capital market performance and other factors may decrease the value of benefit plan assets which then could require significant additional funding and impact earnings 

the performance of the capital markets affects the value of the assets that are held in trust to satisfy future obligations under defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans we have significant obligations in these areas and hold significant assets in these trusts as noted in note 12 pension and other postretirement benefits in the notes to consolidated financial statements these assets are subject to market fluctuations and may yield uncertain returns which fall below our projected rates of return a decline in the market value of assets may increase the funding requirements of the obligations under the defined benefit pension plan additionally changes in interest rates affect the liabilities under these benefit plans as interest rates decrease the liabilities increase which could potentially increase funding requirements further the funding requirements of the obligations related to these benefits plans may increase due to changes in governmental regulations and participant demographics including increased numbers of retirements or longer life expectancy assumptions as well as voluntary early retirements in addition lower asset returns result in increased expenses ultimately significant funding requirements and increased pension or other postretirement benefit plan expense could negatively impact our results of operations and financial position 

we have significant goodwill any future impairments of goodwill could result in a significant charge to earnings in a future period and negatively impact our compliance with certain covenants under financing agreements 

in accordance with gaap we test goodwill for impairment at least annually and review our definitelived intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate its fair value might be below its carrying value goodwill is also tested for impairment when factors examples of which include reduced cash flow estimates a sustained decline in stock price or market capitalization below book value indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 

a significant charge in the future could impact the capitalization ratio covenant under certain financing agreements we are subject to a financial covenant under our revolving credit facility which requires us to maintain a debt to capitalization ratio that does not exceed 70 as of december 31 2020 the ratio was 625 

changes in the method for determining libor and the potential replacement of the libor benchmark interest rate could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

some of our indebtedness including borrowings under our revolving credit agreement bears interest at a variable rate based on libor from time to time we also enter into hedging instruments to manage our exposure to fluctuations in the libor benchmark interest rate in addition these hedging instruments as well as hedging instruments that our subsidiaries use for hedging natural gas price and basis risk rely on liborbased rates to calculate interest accrued on certain payments that may be required to be made under these agreements such as late payments or interest accrued if any cash collateral should be held by a counterparty any changes announced by regulators in the method pursuant to which the libor rates are determined may result in a sudden or prolonged increase or decrease in the reported libor rates if that were to occur the level of interest payments we incur may change 

in july 2017 the united kingdom financial conduct authority “fca” which regulates libor announced that the fca intends to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of libor after 2021 in november 2020 the board of governors of the us federal reserve system the federal deposit insurance corporation and the office of the us comptroller of the currency collectively issued a statement encouraging banks to stop entering into financial contracts that use libor as a reference rate as soon as possible and no later than december 31 2021 it is not possible to predict the effect of these changes other reforms or the establishment of alternative reference rates in the united kingdom or elsewhere in the united states efforts to identify a set of alternative us dollar reference interest rates include proposals by the alternative reference rates committee of the federal reserve board and the federal reserve bank of new york the alternative reference rates committee has proposed the secured overnight financing rate sofr as its recommended alternative to libor and the federal reserve bank of new york began publishing sofr rates in april 2018 sofr is intended to be a 

item 1a risk factors 

n i s ource i nc  

broad measure of the cost of borrowing cash overnight that is collateralized by us treasury securities however because sofr is a broad us treasury repurchase agreement financing rate that represents overnight secured funding transactions it differs fundamentally from libor for example sofr is a secured overnight rate while libor is an unsecured rate that represents interbank funding over different maturities in addition because sofr is a transactionbased rate it is backwardlooking whereas libor is forwardlooking because of these and other differences there is no assurance that sofr will perform in the same way as libor would have performed at any time and there is no guarantee that it is a comparable substitute for libor 

in addition although certain of our libor based obligations provide for alternative methods of calculating the interest rate payable on certain of our obligations if libor is not reported which include without limitation requesting certain rates from major reference banks in london or new york uncertainty as to the extent and manner of future changes may result in interest rates andor payments that are higher than lower than or that do not otherwise correlate over time with the interest rates or payments that would have been made on our obligations if a liborbased rate was available in its current form 

litigation regulatory and legislative risks 

the outcome of legal and regulatory proceedings investigations inquiries claims and litigation related to our business operations may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position or liquidity 

we are involved in legal and regulatory proceedings investigations inquiries claims and litigation in connection with our business operations including those related to the greater lawrence incident the most significant of which are summarized in note 20 “other commitments and contingencies” in the notes to consolidated financial statements our insurance does not cover all costs and expenses that we have incurred or that we may incur in the future relating to the greater lawrence incident and may not fully cover incidents that could occur in the future due to the inherent uncertainty of the outcomes of such matters there can be no assurance that the resolution of any particular claim or proceeding would not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position or liquidity 

the greater lawrence incident has materially adversely affected and may continue to materially adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

in connection with the greater lawrence incident we have incurred and will incur various costs and expenses we have been subject to inquiries and investigations by government authorities and regulatory agencies regarding the greater lawrence incident including the massachusetts dpu and the massachusetts attorney generals office as further described in note 7 goodwill and other intangible assets note 20c legal proceedings and note 20e other matters in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

while we have recovered the full amount of our liability insurance coverage available under our policies total expenses related to the incident have exceeded such amount expenses in excess of our liability insurance coverage have materially adversely affected and may continue to materially adversely affect our results of operations cash flows and financial position 

we may also incur additional costs associated with the greater lawrence incident beyond the amount currently anticipated including in connection with the us attorney’s office investigation as well as civil litigation further state or federal legislation may be enacted that would require us to incur additional costs by mandating various changes including changes to our operating practice standards for natural gas distribution operations and safety if we are unable to recover the capital cost of the gas pipeline replacement through the pending property insurance litigation related to this matter or we incur a material amount of other costs our financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

further if it is determined in other matters that we did not comply with applicable statutes regulations or rules in connection with the operations or maintenance of our natural gas system and we are ordered to pay additional amounts in penalties or other amounts our financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

our settlement with the us attorney’s office in respect of federal charges in connection with the greater lawrence incident may expose us to further penalties liabilities and private litigation and may impact our operations 

on february 26 2020 the company entered into a dpa and columbia of massachusetts entered into a plea agreement with the us attorney’s office to resolve the us attorney’s office’s investigation relating to the greater lawrence incident which was subsequently approved by the united states district court for the district of massachusetts the court see note 20c legal proceedings” in the notes to consolidated financial statements the agreements impose various compliance and remedial obligations on the company and columbia of massachusetts failure to comply with the terms of these agreements could result in further enforcement action by the us attorney’s office expose the company and columbia of massachusetts

our businesses are subject to various laws regulations and tariffs we could be materially adversely affected if we fail to comply with such laws regulations and tariffs or with any changes in or new interpretations of such laws regulations and tariffs 

our businesses are subject to various laws regulations and tariffs including but not limited to those relating to natural gas pipeline safety employee safety the environment and our energy infrastructure existing laws regulations and tariffs may be revised or become subject to new interpretations and new laws regulations and tariffs may be adopted or become applicable to us and our operations in some cases compliance with new laws regulations and tariffs increases our costs if we fail to comply with laws regulations and tariffs applicable to us or with any changes in or new interpretations of such laws regulations or tariffs our financial condition results of operations regulatory outcomes and cash flows may be materially adversely affected 

our businesses are regulated under numerous environmental laws the cost of compliance with these laws and changes to or additions to or reinterpretations of the laws could be significant liability from the failure to comply with existing or changed laws could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

our businesses are subject to extensive federal state and local environmental laws and rules that regulate among other things air emissions water usage and discharges ghg and waste products such as coal combustion residuals compliance with these legal obligations require us to make expenditures for installation of pollution control equipment remediation environmental monitoring emissions fees and permits at many of our facilities these expenditures are significant and we expect that they will continue to be significant in the future furthermore if we fail to comply with environmental laws and regulations or are found to have caused damage to the environment or persons that failure or harm may result in the assessment of civil or criminal penalties and damages against us injunctions to remedy the failure or harm and the inability to operate facilities as designed 

existing environmental laws and regulations may be revised and new laws and regulations seeking to change environmental regulation of the energy industry may be adopted or become applicable to us with an increasing focus on both coal and natural gas revised or additional laws and regulations may result in significant additional expense and operating restrictions on our facilities or increased compliance costs which may not be fully recoverable from customers through regulated rates and could therefore impact our financial position financial results and cash flow moreover such costs could materially affect the continued economic viability of one or more of our facilities 

an area of significant uncertainty and risk are the laws concerning emission of ghg while we continue to reduce ghg emissions through the retirement of coalfired electric generation increased sourcing of renewable energy and priority pipeline replacement energy efficiency programs leak detection and repair ghg emissions are currently an expected aspect of the electric and natural gas business revised or additional future ghg legislation andor regulation related to the generation of electricity or the extraction production distribution transmission storage and end use of natural gas could materially impact our gas supply financial position financial results and cash flows 

even in instances where legal and regulatory requirements are already known or anticipated the original cost estimates for environmental improvements remediation of past environmental impact or pollution reduction strategies and equipment can differ materially from the amount ultimately expended the actual future expenditures depend on many factors including the nature and extent of impact the method of improvement the cost of raw materials contractor costs and requirements established by environmental authorities changes in costs and the ability to recover under regulatory mechanisms could affect our financial position financial results and cash flows 

changes in taxation and the ability to quantify such changes as well as challenges to tax positions could adversely affect our financial results 

we are subject to taxation by the various taxing authorities at the federal state and local levels where we do business legislation or regulation which could affect our tax burden could be enacted by any of these governmental authorities for example the tcja includes numerous provisions that affect businesses including changes to us corporate tax rates businessrelated exclusions deductions and credits the outcome of regulatory proceedings regarding the extent to which the effect of a change in corporate tax rate will impact customers and the time period over which the impact will occur could significantly impact future earnings and cash flows separately a challenge by a taxing authority changes in taxing authorities’

summary of consolidated financial results 

a summary of our consolidated financial results for the years ended december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 are presented below 



the majority of the costs of energy in both segments are tracked costs that are passed through directly to the customer resulting in an equal and offsetting amount reflected in operating revenues 

on a consolidated basis we reported a net loss available to common shareholders of 727 million or 019 per basic share for the twelve months ended december 31 2020 compared to income to common shareholders of 3280 million or 088 per basic share for the same period in 2019 additionally we reported operating income of 5508 million for the twelve months ended december 31 2020 compared to 8907 million for the same period in 2019 the decrease in both net income available to common shareholders and operating income during 2020 was primarily due to lower operating revenue related to the sale of the massachusetts business as well as higher operating expenses due to insurance recoveries recorded in 2019 net of thirdparty claims and other costs related to the greater lawrence incident additionally the decrease to net income available to common shareholders was also impacted by the loss on early extinguishment of debt in 2020 as well as partially offset by a change from income tax expense in 2019 to an income tax benefit in 2020 

other deductions net 

other deductions net reduced income by 5821 million in 2020 compared to a reduction in income of 3841 million in 2019 this change is primarily due to the loss on early extinguishment of debt in 2020

income taxes 

the decrease in income tax expense from 2019 to 2020 is primarily attributable to lower pretax income resulting from the items discussed above in operating income and other deductions net state jurisdictional mix of pretax loss in 2020 tax effected at statutory tax rates and increased amortization of excess deferred federal income taxes in 2020 compared to 2019 these items are offset by increased deferred tax expense recognized on the sale of the columbia of massachusetts regulatory liability established due to tcja in 2017 that would have otherwise been recognized over the amortization period noncash impairment of goodwill related to columbia of massachusetts in 2019 see note 7 goodwill and other intangible assets for additional information and onetime adjustments to deferred tax balances

presentation of segment information 

our operations are divided into two primary reportable segments gas distribution operations and electric operations the remainder of our operations which are not significant enough on a standalone basis to warrant treatment as an operating segment are presented as corporate and other within the notes to the consolidated financial statements and primarily are comprised of interest expense on holding company debt and unallocated corporate costs and activities

gas distribution operations continued 

cost of energy for the gas distribution operations segment is principally comprised of the cost of natural gas used while providing transportation and distribution services to customers these are tracked costs that are passed through directly to the customer resulting in an equal and offsetting amount reflected in operating revenue in addition comparability of operation and maintenance expenses depreciation and amortization and other taxes may be impacted by regulatory depreciation and tax trackers that allow for the recovery in rates of certain costs therefore increases in these tracked operating expenses are offset by increases in operating revenues and have essentially no impact on net income 

2020 vs 2019 operating income 

for 2020 gas distribution operations reported operating income of 1991 million a decrease of 4763 million from the comparable 2019 period 

operating revenues for 2020 were 31401 million a decrease of 3827 million from the same period in 2019 the change in operating revenues was primarily driven by

• lower revenues due to the sale of the massachusetts business of 1022 million 

• lower revenues from the effects of warmer weather in 2020 of 479 million 

• lower regulatory depreciation and tax trackers which are offset in operating expense of 207 million

• severance and outside services expense related to nisource next initiative of 324 million 

• increased expenses primarily due to the impact of the pandemic related to materials and supplies outside services and uncollectible expenses of 238 million offset by 120 million of deferral of uncollectible and other expenses net of benefits related to the pandemic 

• higher depreciation and amortization and property tax expense primarily due to higher capital expenditures placed in service of 243 million 

partially offset by 

• lower cost of energy billed to customers which is offset in operating revenue of 2734 

• noncash impairment of the columbia of massachusetts franchise rights of 2097 million in 2019 

• lower operation and maintenance and depreciation and amortization expenses due to the massachusetts business sale of 987 million

operating expenses were 8262 million lower in 2019 compared to 2018 this change was primarily driven by 

• decreased expenses related to thirdparty claims and other costs for the greater lawrence incident of 10907 million net of insurance recoveries recorded 

• lower cost of energy billed to customers which is offset in operating revenues of 1917 million 

partially offset by 

• noncash impairment of the columbia of massachusetts franchise rights of 2097 million 

• increased depreciation of 1038 million due to the regulatory outcome of nipscos gas rate case an increase in amortization of depreciation previously deferred as a regulator asset resulting from columbia of ohios cep and higher capital expenditures placed in service 

• higher employee and administrative expenses of 502 million driven by resources shifting from the temporary assistance on the greater lawrence incident restoration to normal operations offset in the decreased greater lawrence incident costs discussed above and an increase in headcount 

• increased regulatory depreciation and tax trackers which are offset in operating revenues of 362 million 

• higher property taxes of 222 million primarily due to increased amortization of property taxes previously deferred as a regulatory asset resulting from columbia of ohios cep as well as higher capital expenditures placed in service 

• higher outside services of 174 million primarily due to increased line location and safetyrelated work 

weather 

in general we calculate the weatherrelated revenue variance based on changing customer demand driven by weather variance from normal heating degree days net of weather normalization mechanisms our composite heating degree days reported do not directly correlate to the weatherrelated dollar impact on the results of gas distribution operations heating degree days experienced during different times of the year or in different operating locations may have more or less impact on volume and dollars depending on when and where they occur when the detailed results are combined for reporting there may be weatherrelated dollar impacts on operations when there is not an apparent or significant change in our aggregated composite heating degree day comparison 

the definition of “normal” weather was updated during the first quarter of 2019 to reflect more current weather pattern data and to more closely align with the regulators jurisdictional definitions of “normal” weather impacts of the change in methodology will be reflected prospectively and disclosed to the extent it results in notable yearoveryear variances in operating revenues 

weather in the gas distribution operations service territories for 2020 was about 7 warmer than normal and about 5 warmer than 2019 leading to decreased operating revenues of 479 million for the year ended december 31 2020 compared to 2019 the majority of these amounts were driven by nipsco and columbia of pennsylvania 

weather in the gas distribution operations service territories for 2019 was about 1 warmer than normal and about 3 warmer than 2018 however due to the aforementioned change in methodology the change in operating revenues attributed to weather resulted in an increase of 74 million for the year ended december 31 2019 compared to 2018 the variance is detailed further below 

• an update in the weatherrelated normal heating degree day methodology resulting in a favorable variance attributed to weather of 145 million as discussed above

throughput 

total volumes sold and transported for the year ended december 31 2020 were 9817 mmdth compared to 10402 mmdth for 2019 this decrease is primarily attributable to warmer weather experienced in 2020 compared to 2019 the sale of the massachusetts business and decreased usage by commercial and industrial customers primarily due to the pandemic 

total volumes sold and transported for the year ended december 31 2019 were 10402 mmdth compared to 10536 mmdth for 2018 this decrease is primarily attributable to warmer weather experienced in 2019 compared to 2018 

commodity price impact 

all of our gas distribution operations companies have stateapproved recovery mechanisms that provide a means for full recovery of prudently incurred gas costs gas costs are treated as passthrough costs and have no impact on the operating income recorded in the period the gas costs included in revenues are matched with the gas cost expense recorded in the period and the difference is recorded on the consolidated balance sheets as underrecovered or overrecovered gas cost to be included in future customer billings 

certain gas distribution operations companies continue to offer choice opportunities where customers can choose to purchase gas from a thirdparty supplier through regulatory initiatives in their respective jurisdictions these programs serve to further reduce our exposure to gas prices

electric operations continued 

cost of energy for the electric operations segment is principally comprised of the cost of coal related handling costs natural gas purchased for internal generation of electricity at nipsco and the cost of power purchased from thirdparty generators of electricity the majority of these are tracked costs that are passed through directly to the customer resulting in an equal and offsetting amount reflected in operating revenue in addition comparability of operation and maintenance expenses and depreciation and amortization may be impacted by regulatory and depreciation trackers that allow for the recovery in rates of certain costs therefore increases in these tracked operating expenses are offset by increases in operating revenues and have essentially no impact on net income 

2020 vs 2019 operating income 

for 2020 electric operations reported operating income of 3488 million a decrease of 580 million from the comparable 2019 period 

operating revenues for 2020 were 15366 million an decrease of 1626 million from the same period in 2019 the change in operating revenues was primarily driven by 

• lower cost of energy billed to customers which is offset in operating expense of 1521 million 

• lower regulatory and depreciation trackers which are offset in operating expense of 252 million 

• the effects of decreased commercial and industrial usage and decreased late and disconnection fees both primarily related to the covid19 pandemic of 249 million 

partially offset by 

• higher revenue from recent base rate proceedings of 225 million 

• the effects of increased residential usage primarily related to the pandemic of 135 million 

• the effects of customer growth of 40 million 

operating expenses were 1046 million lower in 2020 than 2019 this change was primarily driven by 

• lower cost of energy billed to customers which is offset in operating revenue of 1521 million 

• lower regulatory and depreciation trackers which are offset in operating revenues of 252 million 

• lower outside services costs of 160 million primarily related to lower generationrelated maintenance 

• lower employee and administrative costs of 81 million 

partially offset by 

• increased depreciation of 616 million primarily due to additional plant placed in service 

• severance and outside services expenses related to the nisource next initiative of 130 million 

• increased expenses primarily due to the impact of pandemicrelated materials and supplies outside services uncollectible and sequestration expenses of 107 million offset by a 53 million deferral of uncollectible and other expenses related to the pandemic 

• increased materials and supplies costs of 47 million 

• higher insurance expense of 27 million primarily driven by increased premiums 

• increased environmental costs of 13 million 

2019 vs 2018 operating income 

for 2019 electric operations reported operating income of 4068 million an increase of 207 million from the comparable 2018 period 

operating revenues for 2019 were 16992 million a decrease of 90 million from the same period in 2018 the change in operating revenues was primarily driven by 

• lower cost of energy billed to customers which is offset in operating expense of 348 million 

• lower revenues from the effects of cooler weather of 151 million

• higher regulatory and depreciation trackers which are offset in operating expense of 84 million 

• increased commercial and residential customer growth of 39 million 

operating expenses were 297 million lower in 2019 than 2018 this change was primarily driven by 

• lower cost of energy billed to customers which is offset in operating revenue of 348 million 

• decreased materials and supplies costs of 78 million primarily related to the retirement of bailly generating station units 7 and 8 on may 31 2018 

• decreased employee and administrative costs of 50 million 

partially offset by 

• higher regulatory and depreciation trackers which are offset in operating revenues of 84 million

weather 

in general we calculate the weatherrelated revenue variance based on changing customer demand driven by weather variance from normal heating or cooling degree days our composite heating or cooling degree days reported do not directly correlate to the weatherrelated dollar impact on the results of electric operations heating or cooling degree days experienced during different times of the year may have more or less impact on volume and dollars depending on when they occur when the detailed results are combined for reporting there may be weatherrelated dollar impacts on operations when there is not an apparent or significant change in our aggregated composite heating or cooling degree day comparison

weather in the electric operations’ territories for 2020 was 12 warmer than normal and 6 cooler than the same period in 2019 which had an immaterial impact on operating revenues for the year ended december 31 2020 compared to 2019 

weather in the electric operations’ territories for 2019 was 20 warmer than normal and 18 cooler than the same period in 2018 decreasing operating revenues 151 million for the year ended december 31 2019 compared to 2018 

sales 

electric operations sales were 147039 gwh for 2020 a decrease of 10174 gwh or 65 compared to 2019 this decrease was primarily attributable to decreased usage by industrial and commercial customers due to the pandemic and higher selfgeneration by industrial customers partially offset by increased usage by residential customers primarily due to the pandemic 

electric operations sales were 157213 gwh for 2019 a decrease of 7267 gwh or 44 compared to 2018 this decrease was primarily attributable to higher internal generation from large industrial customers in 2019 and the effects of cooler weather on residential and commercial customers

nipsco 2018 integrated resource plan nipsco concluded in its october 2018 integrated resource plan submission that nipsco’s current fleet of coal generation facilities will be retired earlier than previous integrated resource plan’s had indicated the integrated resource plan evaluated demandside and supplyside resource alternatives to reliably and cost effectively meet nipsco customers future energy requirements over the ensuing 20 years the preferred option within the integrated resource plan retires the rm schahfer generating station by mid2023 and the michigan city generating station by the end of 2028 these stations represent 2080 mw of generating capacity equal to 72 of nipsco’s remaining capacity and 100 of nipscos remaining coalfired generating capacity in the second quarter of 2020 the miso approved nipscos plan to retire the rm schahfer generating station in 2023 the planned replacement by the end of 2023 of approximately 1400 mw of retiring coalfired generation station could provide incremental capital investment opportunities of approximately 18 to 20 billion primarily in 2022 and 2023 refer to note 6 property plant and equipment and note 20e other matters in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information in february 2021 nipsco decided to submit modified attachment y notices to miso requesting accelerated retirement of two of the four coal fired units at rm schahfer generating station the two units are now expected to be retired by the end of 2021 with the remaining two units still scheduled to be retired in 2023 at retirement the net book value of the retired units will be reclassified from nonutility and other property to current and longterm “regulatory assets” 

the current replacement plan includes renewable sources of energy including wind solar and battery storage to be obtained through a combination of nipsco ownership and ppas nipsco has executed several ppas to purchase 100 of the output from renewable generation facilities at a fixed price per mwh each facility supplying the energy will have an associated nameplate capacity and payments under the ppas will not begin until the associated generation facility is constructed by the ownerseller nipsco has also executed several btas with developers to construct renewable generation facilities the following table summarizes the executed ppas and btas that have not yet been placed into service 



1 ownership of the facility was transferred to a joint venture whose members include nipsco and an unrelated tax equity partner 

2 ownership of the facilities will be transferred to joint ventures whose members include nipsco and an unrelated tax equity partner

liquidity and capital resources 

we continually evaluate the availability of adequate financing to fund our ongoing business operations working capital and core safety and infrastructure investment programs our financing is sourced through cash flow from operations and the issuance of debt andor equity external debt financing is provided primarily through the issuance of longterm debt accounts receivable securitization programs and our 15 billion commercial paper program which is backstopped by our committed revolving credit facility with a total availability from thirdparty lenders of 185 billion the commercial paper program and credit facility provide costeffective shortterm financing until it can be replaced with a balance of longterm debt and equity financing that achieves our desired capital structure we have also utilized an atthemarket atm equity sales program that allowed us to issue and sell shares of our common stock up to an aggregate offering price of 4344 million the program expired on december 31 2020 but we expect to issue additional equity under atm offerings from time to time 

we believe these sources provide adequate capital to fund our operating activities and capital expenditures in 2021 and beyond 

greater lawrence incident as discussed in the executive summary part i item 1a “risk factors” and in note 20 “other commitments and contingencies” in the notes to consolidated financial statements due to the inherent uncertainty of litigation there can be no assurance that the outcome or resolution of any particular claim related to the greater lawrence incident will not continue to have an adverse impact on our cash flows through income generated from operating activities amounts available under the shortterm revolving credit facility and our ability to access capital markets we believe we have adequate capital available to settle remaining anticipated claims associated with the greater lawrence incident previous costs in excess of insurance recoveries were primarily funded through shortterm borrowings the sale of the massachusetts business was completed on october 9 2020 on october 14 2020 we used a portion of the proceeds from the massachusetts business sale to pay down these shortterm borrowings 

operating activities 

net cash from operating activities for the year ended december 31 2020 was 11040 million a decrease of 4793 million from 2019 this decrease was primarily driven by a year over year increase in net payments related to the greater lawrence incident during 2020 we paid approximately 227 million compared to net receipts of 289 million representing insurance recoveries offset by payments during 2019 refer to note 20 other commitments and contingencies in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information related to the greater lawrence incident 

investing activities 

our cash used for investing activities varies year over year primarily as a result of changes in the level of annual capital expenditures see below for further details of our capital expenditures and related regulatory programs in 2020 our typical investing cash outflows were offset by 11159 million of proceeds from the sale of assets driven by the sale of the massachusetts business refer to note 1 nature of operations and summary of significant accounting policies for more information

capital expenditures the table below reflects capital expenditures and certain other investing activities by segment for 2020 2019 and 2018   



1 corporate and other capital expenditures were zero in 2018 as specific it assets were leased in 2018 certain it and other maintenance related assets were purchased in 2019 and 2020 

2 amounts differ from those presented on the statements of consolidated cash flows primarily due to the capitalized portion of the corporate incentive plan payout inclusion of capital expenditures included in current liabilities and afudc equity 

3 the 2018 capital expenditures for gas distribution operations reflects reclassifying the greater lawrence incident pipeline replacement from system growth and tracker to maintenance 

for 2020 capital expenditures and certain other investing activities were 17208 million which was 1470 million lower than the 2019 capital program this decrease in spending is primarily due to the sale of the massachusetts business and impact of covid 19 

for 2019 capital expenditures and certain other investing activities were 18678 million which was 532 million higher than the 2018 capital program this increased spending is primarily due to growth safety and system modernization projects 

for 2021 we project to invest approximately 19 to 21 billion in our capital program this projected level of spend is an increase from our 2020 spend levels and supports continued investment in safety and reliability through modernizing gas and electric systems while meeting customer growth demands

market risk disclosures 

risk is an inherent part of our businesses the extent to which we properly and effectively identify assess monitor and manage each of the various types of risk involved in our businesses is critical to our profitability we seek to identify assess monitor and manage in accordance with defined policies and procedures the following principal market risks that are involved in our businesses commodity price risk interest rate risk and credit risk we manage risk through a multifaceted process with oversight by the risk management committee that requires constant communication judgment and knowledge of specialized products and markets our senior management takes an active role in the risk management process and has developed policies and procedures that require specific administrative and business functions to assist in the identification assessment and control of various risks these may include but are not limited to market operational financial compliance and strategic risk types in recognition of the increasingly varied and complex nature of the energy business our risk management process policies and procedures continue to evolve and are subject to ongoing review and modification 

commodity price risk 

we are exposed to commodity price risk as a result of our subsidiaries’ operations involving natural gas and power to manage this market risk our subsidiaries use derivatives including commodity futures contracts swaps forwards and options we do not participate in speculative energy trading activity 

commodity price risk resulting from derivative activities at our rateregulated subsidiaries is limited since regulations allow recovery of prudently incurred purchased power fuel and gas costs through the ratemaking process including gains or losses on these derivative instruments if states should explore additional regulatory reform these subsidiaries may begin providing services without the benefit of the traditional ratemaking process and may be more exposed to commodity price risk 

our subsidiaries are required to make cash margin deposits with their brokers to cover actual and potential losses in the value of outstanding exchange traded derivative contracts the amount of these deposits some of which is reflected in our restricted cash balance may fluctuate significantly during periods of high volatility in the energy commodity markets 

refer to note 10 risk management activities in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information on our commodity price risk assets and liabilities as of december 31 2020 and 2019 

interest rate risk 

we are exposed to interest rate risk as a result of changes in interest rates on borrowings under our revolving credit agreement commercial paper program accounts receivable programs and nowsettled term loan which have interest rates that are indexed to shortterm market interest rates based upon average borrowings and debt obligations subject to fluctuations in shortterm market interest rates an increase or decrease in shortterm interest rates of 100 basis points 1 would have increased or decreased interest expense by 123 million and 190 million for 2020 and 2019 respectively we are also exposed to interest rate risk as a result of changes in benchmark rates that can influence the interest rates of future debt issuances

credit risk 

due to the nature of the industry credit risk is embedded in many of our business activities our extension of credit is governed by a corporate credit risk policy in addition risk management committee guidelines are in place which document management approval levels for credit limits evaluation of creditworthiness and credit risk mitigation efforts exposures to credit risks are monitored by the risk management function which is independent of commercial operations credit risk arises due to the possibility that a customer supplier or counterparty will not be able or willing to fulfill its obligations on a transaction on or before the settlement date for derivativerelated contracts credit risk arises when counterparties are obligated to deliver or purchase defined commodity units of gas or power to us at a future date per execution of contractual terms and conditions exposure to credit risk is measured in terms of both current obligations and the market value of forward positions net of any posted collateral such as cash and letters of credit 

we closely monitor the financial status of our banking credit providers we evaluate the financial status of our banking partners through the use of marketbased metrics such as credit default swap pricing levels and also through traditional credit ratings provided by major credit rating agencies 

certain individual state regulatory commissions instituted regulatory moratoriums in connection with the covid19 pandemic that impacted our ability to pursue our credit risk mitigation practices for customer accounts receivable following the issuances of these moratoriums certain of our regulated operations have been authorized to recognize a regulatory asset for bad debt costs above levels currently in rates we have reinstated our common credit mitigation practices where moratoriums have expired see the covid19 pandemic discussion in part i item 1a risk factors for risks that have been identified related to the pandemic and refer to note 9 regulatory matters in the notes to consolidated financial statements for state specific regulatory moratoriums

critical accounting policies 

we apply certain accounting policies based on the accounting requirements discussed below that have had and may continue to have significant impacts on our operations and consolidated financial statements 

basis of accounting for rateregulated subsidiaries asc topic 980 regulated operations  provides that rateregulated subsidiaries account for and report assets and liabilities consistent with the economic effect of the way in which regulators establish rates if the rates established are designed to recover the costs of providing the regulated service and if the competitive environment makes it probable that such rates can be charged and collected certain expenses and credits subject to utility regulation or rate determination normally reflected in income are deferred on the consolidated balance sheets and are recognized in income as the related amounts are included in service rates and recovered from or refunded to customers the total amounts of regulatory assets and liabilities reflected on the consolidated balance sheets were 19305 million and 20655 million at december 31 2020 and 22396 million and 25122 million at december 31 2019 respectively for additional information refer to note 9 “regulatory matters” in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

in the event that regulation significantly changes the opportunity for us to recover our costs in the future all or a portion of our regulated operations may no longer meet the criteria for the application of asc topic 980 regulated operations  in such event a writedown of all or a portion of our existing regulatory assets and liabilities could result if transition cost recovery is approved by the appropriate regulatory bodies that would meet the requirements under gaap for continued accounting as regulatory assets and liabilities during such recovery period the regulatory assets and liabilities would be reported at the recoverable amounts if we were unable to continue to apply the provisions of asc topic 980 regulated operations  we would be required to apply the provisions of asc topic 98020 discontinuation of rateregulated accounting  in management’s opinion our regulated subsidiaries will be subject to asc topic 980 regulated operations for the foreseeable future 

certain of the regulatory assets reflected on our consolidated balance sheets require specific regulatory action in order to be included in future service rates although recovery of these amounts is not guaranteed we believe that these costs meet the requirements for deferral as regulatory assets if we determine that the amounts included as regulatory assets are no longer recoverable a charge to income would immediately be required to the extent of the unrecoverable amounts

the passage of the tcja into law in december 2017 necessitated the remeasurement of our deferred income tax balances to reflect the change in the statutory federal tax rate from 35 to 21 for our regulated entities substantially all of the impact of this remeasurement was recorded to a regulatory liability and is being passed backed to customers as established during the rate making process for additional information refer to note 9 regulatory matters and note 11 income taxes in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

pension and postretirement benefits we have defined benefit plans for both pension and other postretirement benefits the calculation of the net obligations and annual expense related to the plans requires a significant degree of judgment regarding the discount rates to be used in bringing the liabilities to present value expected longterm rates of return on plan assets health care trend rates and mortality rates among other assumptions due to the size of the plans and the longterm nature of the associated liabilities changes in the assumptions used in the actuarial estimates could have material impacts on the measurement of the net obligations and annual expense recognition differences between actuarial assumptions and actual plan results are deferred into aoci or a regulatory balance sheet account depending on the jurisdiction of our entity these deferred gains or losses are then amortized into the income statement when the accumulated differences exceed 10 of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or the fair value of plan assets known in gaap as the “corridor” method or when settlement accounting is triggered 

the discount rates expected longterm rates of return on plan assets health care cost trend rates and mortality rates are critical assumptions methods used to develop these assumptions are described below while a third party actuarial firm assists with the development of many of these assumptions we are ultimately responsible for selecting the final assumptions 

the discount rate is utilized principally in calculating the actuarial present value of pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit plan costs our discount rates for both pension and other postretirement benefits are determined using spot rates along an aarated above median yield curve with cash flows matching the expected duration of benefit payments to be made to plan participants 

the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets is a component utilized in calculating annual pension and other postretirement benefit plan costs we estimate the expected return on plan assets by evaluating expected bond returns equity risk premiums target asset allocations the effects of active plan management the impact of periodic plan asset rebalancing and historical performance we also consider the guidance from our investment advisors in making a final determination of our expected rate of return on assets for measurement of 2021 net periodic benefit cost we selected an expected pretax longterm rate of return of 520 and 550 for our pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets respectively 

we estimate the assumed health care cost trend rate which is used in determining our other postretirement benefit net expense based upon our actual health care cost experience the effects of recently enacted legislation thirdparty actuarial surveys and general economic conditions 

we utilize a full yield curve approach to estimate the service and interest components of net periodic benefit cost for pension and other postretirement benefits by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows for further discussion of our pension and other postretirement benefits see note 12 “pension and other postretirement benefits” in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

typically we use the society of actuaries’ most recently published mortality data in developing a best estimate of mortality as part of the calculation of the pension and other postretirement benefit obligations due to the ongoing covid19 pandemic we adjusted our mortality assumption through 2023 to reflect anticipated slow recovery

the following tables illustrate the effects of changes in these actuarial assumptions while holding all other assumptions constant

goodwill and other intangible assets we have six goodwill reporting units comprised of the six state operating companies within the gas distribution operations reportable segment our goodwill assets at december 31 2020 were 1486 million most of which resulted from the acquisition of columbia on november 1 2000 

as required by gaap we test for impairment of goodwill on an annual basis and on an interim basis when events or circumstances indicate that a potential impairment may exist our annual goodwill test takes place in the second quarter of each year and was performed on may 1 2020 

a quantitative step 1 test was completed on may 1 2020 for all reporting units columbia of massachusetts was not considered to be a reporting unit for the may 1 2020 fair value measurement as the goodwill balance had been reduced to zero as of december 31 2019 consistent with our historical impairment testing of goodwill fair value of the reporting units was determined based on a weighting of income and market approaches these approaches require significant judgments including appropriate longterm growth rates and discount rates for the income approach and appropriate multiples of earnings for peer companies and control premiums for the market approach the discount rates were derived using peer company data compiled with the assistance of a third party valuation services firm the discount rates used are subject to change based on changes in tax rates at both the state and federal level debt and equity ratios at each reporting unit and general economic conditions the longterm growth rate was derived by evaluating historic growth rates new business and investment opportunities beyond the near term horizon the longterm growth rate is subject to change depending on inflationary impacts to the us economy and the individual business environments in which each reporting unit operates the step 1 analysis performed indicated that the fair value of each of the reporting units exceeds their carrying value as a result no impairment charges were recorded 

we recorded impairment charges related to goodwill and other intangible assets in 2019 see note 7 goodwill and other intangible assets in the notes to consolidated financial statements for information regarding our 2019 analyses and assumptions 

revenue recognition revenue is recorded as products and services are delivered utility revenues are billed to customers monthly on a cycle basis revenues are recorded on the accrual basis and include estimates for electricity and gas delivered but not billed 

we adopted the provisions of asc 606 beginning on january 1 2018 using a modified retrospective method which was applied to all contracts no material adjustments were made to january 1 2018 opening balances and no material changes in the amount or timing of future revenue recognition occurred as a result of the adoption of asc 606 refer to note 3 revenue recognition in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our significant judgments and estimates related to revenue recognition

variable interest entities a vie is an entity in which the controlling interest is determined through means other than a majority voting interest the primary beneficiary of a vie is the business enterprise which has the power to direct the activities of the vie that most significantly impact the vie’s economic performance also the primary beneficiary either absorbs a significant amount of the vie’s losses or has the right to receive benefits that could be significant to the vie we consider these qualitative elements in determining whether we are the primary beneficiary of a vie and we consolidate those vies for which we are determined to be the primary beneficiary as the managing member of a partnership we would control decisions that are significant to the ongoing operations and economic results therefore we have concluded that we are the primary beneficiary of rosewater and have consolidated rosewater even though we own less than 100 of the total equity membership interest 

we have determined that the use of hlbv accounting is reasonable and appropriate to attribute income and loss to the noncontrolling interest held by the tax equity partner hlbv accounting was selected as the allocation of rosewaters economic results to members differ from the members relative ownership percentages using the hlbv method our earnings are calculated based on how the partnership would distribute its cash if it were to hypothetically sell all of its assets for their carrying amounts and liquidate at each reporting period under hlbv we calculate the liquidation value allocable to each partner at the beginning and end of each period based on the contractual liquidation waterfall and adjust our income for the period to reflect the change our associated book value refer to note 4 variable interest entities in the notes to consolidated financial statements

nisource inc is an energy holding company under the public utility holding company act of 2005 whose subsidiaries are fully regulated natural gas and electric utility companies serving approximately 40 million customers in seven states nisource is the successor to an indiana corporation organized in 1987 under the name of nipsco industries inc which changed its name to nisource on april 14 1999 

nisource is one of the nation’s largest natural gas distribution companies as measured by number of customers nisource’s principal subsidiaries include nisource gas distribution group inc a natural gas distribution holding company and nipsco a gas and electric company nisource derives substantially all of its revenues and earnings from the operating results of these rateregulated businesses 

on september 13 2018 a series of fires and explosions occurred in lawrence andover and north andover massachusetts related to the delivery of natural gas by columbia of massachusetts referred to herein as the “greater lawrence incident” the greater lawrence incident resulted in one fatality and a number of injuries damaged multiple homes and businesses and caused the temporary evacuation of significant portions of each municipality the massachusetts governor’s office declared a state of emergency authorizing the massachusetts dpu to order another utility company to coordinate the restoration of utility services in lawrence andover and north andover the incident resulted in the interruption of gas for approximately 7500 gas meters the majority of which served residences and approximately 700 of which served businesses and the interruption of other utility service more broadly in the area columbia of massachusetts has replaced the cast iron and bare steel gas pipeline system in the affected area and restored service to nearly all of the gas meters refer to note 6 goodwill and other intangible assets note 19 c legal proceedings and e other matters in the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information 

on february 26 2020 nisource and columbia of massachusetts together with nisource “seller” entered into an asset purchase agreement the asset purchase agreement with eversource a massachusetts voluntary association upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the asset purchase agreement nisource and columbia of massachusetts agreed to sell to eversource with certain additions and exceptions 1 substantially all of the assets of columbia of massachusetts and 2 all of the assets held by any of columbia of massachusetts’ affiliates that primarily relate to the business of storing distributing or transporting natural gas to residential commercial and industrial customers in massachusetts as conducted by columbia of massachusetts and eversource agreed to assume certain liabilities of columbia of massachusetts and its affiliates the liabilities assumed by eversource under the asset purchase agreement do not include among others any liabilities arising out the greater lawrence incident or liabilities of columbia of massachusetts or its affiliates pursuant to civil claims for injury of persons or damage to property to the extent such injury or damage occurs prior to the closing in connection with the massachusetts business the asset purchase agreement provides for a purchase price of 1100 million in cash subject to adjustment based on columbia of massachusetts’ net working capital as of the closing the closing of the transactions contemplated by the asset purchase agreement is subject to hartscottrodino antitrust improvements act of 1976 and regulatory approvals resolution of certain proceedings before governmental bodies and other conditions for additional information see note 26  “subsequent event” in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

nisource’s reportable segments are gas distribution operations and electric operations the following is a summary of the business for each reporting segment refer to item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and note 23  segments of business in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information for each segment 

gas distribution operations 

our natural gas distribution operations serve approximately 35 million customers in seven states and operate approximately 60000 miles of pipeline located in our service areas described below through our whollyowned subsidiary nisource gas distribution group inc we own six distribution subsidiaries that provide natural gas to approximately 27 million residential commercial and industrial customers in ohio pennsylvania virginia kentucky maryland and massachusetts additionally we distribute natural gas to approximately 839000 customers in northern indiana through our whollyowned subsidiary nipsco 

electric operations 

we generate transmit and distribute electricity through our subsidiary nipsco to approximately 476000 customers in 20 counties in the northern part of indiana and engage in wholesale and transmission transactions nipsco owns and operates two coalfired electric generating stations four units at rm schahfer located in wheatfield in and one unit at michigan city located in michigan city in the two operating facilities have a generating capacity of 2080 mw nipsco also owns and operates sugar creek a ccgt plant located in west terre haute in with generating capacity of 571 mw three gasfired generating units located at nipsco’s coalfired electric generating stations with a generating capacity of 186 mw and two hydroelectric generating plants with a generating capacity of 10 mw oakdale located at lake freeman in carroll county in and norway located at lake schahfer in white county in these facilities provide for a total system operating generating capacity of 2847 mw 

item 1 business 

n i s ource i nc  

in may 2018 nipsco completed the retirement of two coalburning units units 7 and 8 at bailly generating station located in chesterton in these units had a generating capacity of approximately 460 mw 

nipsco’s transmission system with voltages from 69000 to 765000 volts consists of 3005 circuit miles nipsco is interconnected with five neighboring electric utilities during the year ended december 31 2019 nipsco generated 624 and purchased 376 of its electric requirements 

nipsco participates in the miso transmission service and wholesale energy market miso is a nonprofit organization created in compliance with ferc regulations to improve the flow of electricity in the regional marketplace and to enhance electric reliability additionally miso is responsible for managing energy markets transmission constraints and the dayahead realtime ftr and ancillary markets nipsco transferred functional control of its electric transmission assets to miso and transmission service for nipsco occurs under the miso open access transmission tariff 

business strategy 

we focus our business strategy on our core rateregulated assetbased businesses with most of our operating income generated from the rateregulated businesses our utilities continue to move forward on core infrastructure and environmental investment programs supported by complementary regulatory and customer initiatives across all seven states in which we operate our goal is to develop strategies that benefit all stakeholders as we address changing customer conservation patterns develop more contemporary pricing structures and embark on longterm investment programs these strategies are intended to improve reliability and safety enhance customer service and reduce emissions while generating sustainable returns 

in its 2018 integrated resource plan submission to the iurc nipsco laid out a plan to retire the rm schahfer generating station units 14 15 17 and 18 by 2023 and michigan city generating station unit 12 by 2028 these units represent 2080 mw of generating capacity equal to 72 of nipsco’s remaining capacity after the retirement of bailly units 7 and 8 in may of 2018 the current replacement plan includes renewable sources of energy including wind solar and battery storage to be obtained through a combination of nipsco ownership and ppas refer to note 19 e other matters in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of these plans 

competition and changes in the regulatory environment 

the regulatory frameworks applicable to our operations at both the state and federal levels continue to evolve these changes have had and will continue to have an impact on our operations structure and profitability management continually seeks new ways to be more competitive and profitable in this environment 

the gas distribution operations companies have pursued nontraditional revenue sources within the evolving natural gas marketplace these efforts include the sale of products and services upstream of the companies’ service territory the sale of products and services in the companies’ service territories and gas supply cost incentive mechanisms for service to their core markets the upstream products are made up of transactions that occur between an individual gas distribution operations company and a buyer for the sales of unbundled or rebundled gas supply and capacity the onsystem services are offered by us to customers and include products such as the transportation and balancing of gas on the gas distribution operations company system the incentive mechanisms give the gas distribution operations companies an opportunity to share in the savings created from such situations as gas purchase prices paid below an agreed upon benchmark and their ability to reduce pipeline capacity charges with their customers 

increased efficiency of natural gas appliances and improvements in home building codes and standards has contributed to a longterm trend of declining average use per customer residential usage for the year ended december 31 2019 decreased primarily due to warmer weather in our operating area compared to the prior year while historically rate design at the distribution level has been structured such that a large portion of cost recovery is based upon throughput rather than in a fixed charge operating costs are largely incurred on a fixed basis and do not fluctuate due to changes in customer usage as a result gas distribution operations have pursued changes in rate design to more effectively match recoveries with costs incurred each of the states in which gas distribution operations operate has different requirements regarding the procedure for establishing changes to rate design columbia of ohio restructured its rate design through a base rate proceeding and has adopted a decoupled rate design which more closely links the recovery of fixed costs with fixed charges columbia of massachusetts received regulatory approval of a decoupling mechanism which adjusts revenues to an approved benchmark level through a volumetric adjustment factor columbia of maryland and columbia of virginia have regulatory approval for a revenue normalization adjustment for certain customer classes a decoupling mechanism whereby monthly revenues that exceed or fall short of approved levels are reconciled in subsequent months in a prior base rate proceeding columbia of pennsylvania implemented a pilot residential weather normalization adjustment columbia of maryland columbia of virginia and columbia of kentucky have had approval for a weather normalization adjustment

n i s ource i nc  

for many years in a prior gas base rate proceeding nipsco implemented a higher fixed customer charge for residential and small customer classes moving toward full straight fixed variable rate design 

natural gas competition  open access to natural gas supplies over interstate pipelines and the deregulation of the commodity price of gas has led to tremendous change in the energy markets ldc customers and marketers can purchase gas directly from producers and marketers as an open competitive market for gas supplies has emerged this separation or “unbundling” of the transportation and other services offered by pipelines and ldcs allows customers to purchase the commodity independent of services provided by the pipelines and ldcs the ldcs continue to purchase gas and recover the associated costs from their customers our gas distribution operations’ subsidiaries are involved in programs that provide customers the opportunity to purchase their natural gas requirements from third parties and use our gas distribution operations’ subsidiaries for transportation services 

gas distribution operations competes with investorowned municipal and cooperative electric utilities throughout its service areas as well as other regulated and unregulated natural gas intra and interstate pipelines and other alternate fuels such as propane and fuel oil gas distribution operations continues to be a strong competitor in the energy market as a result of strong customer preference for natural gas competition with providers of electricity has traditionally been the strongest in the residential and commercial markets of kentucky southern ohio central pennsylvania and western virginia due to comparatively low electric rates natural gas competes with fuel oil and propane in the massachusetts market mainly due to the installed base of fuel oil and propanebased heating which has comprised a declining percentage of the overall market over the last few years however fuel oil and propane are more viable in today’s oil market 

electric competition  indiana electric utilities generally have exclusive service areas under indiana regulations and retail electric customers in indiana do not have the ability to choose their electric supplier nipsco faces nonutility competition from other energy sources such as selfgeneration by large industrial customers and other distributed energy sources   

seasonality 

a significant portion of our operations are subject to seasonal fluctuations in sales during the heating season which is primarily from november through march revenues from gas sales are more significant and during the cooling season which is primarily june through september revenues from electric sales are more significant than in other months 

other relevant business information 

our customer base is broadly diversified with no single customer accounting for a significant portion of revenues 

as of december 31 2019 we had 8363 employees of whom 3219 were subject to collective bargaining agreements collective bargaining agreements for 96 employees are set to expire within one year 

for a listing of certain subsidiaries of nisource refer to exhibit 21 

we electronically file various reports with the sec including annual reports on form 10k quarterly reports on form 10q current reports on form 8k and amendments to such reports as well as our proxy statements for the companys annual meetings of stockholders at httpwwwsecgov  additionally we make all sec filings available without charge to the public on our web site at httpwwwnisourcecom  




 item 1a risk factors 

n i s ource i nc  

our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties including those described below that could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations cash flows and the trading price of our common stock 

we have substantial indebtedness which could adversely affect our financial condition 

our business is capital intensive and we rely significantly on longterm debt to fund a portion of our capital expenditures and repay outstanding debt and on shortterm borrowings to fund a portion of daytoday business operations we had total consolidated indebtedness of 96428 million outstanding as of december 31 2019  our substantial indebtedness could have important consequences for example it could 

 some of our debt obligations contain financial covenants related to debttocapital ratios and crossdefault provisions our failure to comply with any of these covenants could result in an event of default which if not cured or waived could result in the acceleration of outstanding debt obligations 

a drop in our credit ratings could adversely impact our cash flows results of operation financial condition and liquidity 

the availability and cost of credit for our businesses may be greatly affected by credit ratings the credit rating agencies periodically review our ratings taking into account factors such as our capital structure earnings profile and in 2018 and 2019 the impacts of the tcja and the greater lawrence incident we are committed to maintaining investment grade credit ratings however there is no assurance we will be able to do so in the future our credit ratings could be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if in its judgment the circumstances warrant any negative rating action could adversely affect our ability to access capital at rates and on terms that are attractive a negative rating action could also adversely impact our business relationships with suppliers and operating partners who may be less willing to extend credit or offer us similarly favorable terms as secured in the past under such circumstances 

certain of our subsidiaries have agreements that contain “ratings triggers” that require increased collateral in the form of cash a letter of credit or other forms of security for new and existing transactions if the credit ratings of our or certain of our subsidiaries are dropped below investment grade these agreements are primarily for insurance purposes and for the physical purchase or sale of gas or power as of december 31 2019  the collateral requirement that would be required in the event of a downgrade below the ratings trigger levels would amount to approximately 721 million  in addition to agreements with ratings triggers there are other agreements that contain “adequate assurance” or “material adverse change” provisions that could necessitate additional credit support such as letters of credit and cash collateral to transact business 

if our or certain of our subsidiaries credit ratings were downgraded especially below investment grade financing costs and the principal amount of borrowings would likely increase due to the additional risk of our debt and because certain counterparties may require additional credit support as described above such amounts may be material and could adversely affect our cash flows results of operations and financial condition losing investment grade credit ratings may also result in more restrictive covenants and reduced flexibility on repayment terms in debt issuances lower share price and greater stockholder dilution from common equity issuances in addition to reputational damage within the investment community 

we may not be able to execute our business plan or growth strategy including utility infrastructure investments 

business or regulatory conditions may result in us not being able to execute our business plan or growth strategy including identified planned and other utility infrastructure investments our customer and regulatory initiatives may not achieve planned 

item 1a risk factors 

n i s ource i nc  

results utility infrastructure investments may not materialize may cease to be achievable or economically viable and may not be successfully completed natural gas may cease to be viewed as an economically and environmentally attractive fuel certain groups and governmental entities may continue to oppose natural gas delivery and infrastructure investments because of perceived environmental impacts associated with the natural gas supply chain and end use energy conservation energy efficiency distributed generation energy storage policies favoring electric heat over gas heat and other factors may reduce demand for natural gas and energy any of these developments could adversely affect our results of operations and growth prospects even if our business plan and growth strategy are executed there is still risk of among other things human error in maintenance installation or operations shortages or delays in obtaining equipment and performance below expected levels in addition to the other risks discussed in this section 

adverse economic and market conditions or increases in interest rates could materially and adversely affect our results of operations cash flows financial condition and liquidity 

while the national economy is experiencing modest growth we cannot predict how robust future growth will be or whether it will be sustained deteriorating or sluggish economic conditions in our operating jurisdictions could adversely impact our ability to maintain or grow our customer base and collect revenues from customers which could reduce revenue growth and increase operating costs in addition a rising interest rate environment may lead to higher borrowing costs which may adversely impact reported earnings cost of capital and capital holdings rising interest rates and negative market or company events may also result in a decrease in the price of our shares of common stock 

we rely on access to the capital markets to finance our liquidity and longterm capital requirements including expenditures for our utility infrastructure and to comply with future regulatory requirements to the extent not satisfied by the cash flow generated by our operations we have historically relied on longterm debt and on the issuance of equity securities to fund a portion of our capital expenditures and repay outstanding debt and on shortterm borrowings to fund a portion of daytoday business operations successful implementation of our longterm business strategies including capital investment is dependent upon our ability to access the capital and credit markets including the banking and commercial paper markets on competitive terms and rates an economic downturn or uncertainty market turmoil changes in tax policy challenges faced by financial institutions changes in our credit ratings or a change in investor sentiment toward us or the utilities industry generally could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital or refinance debt reduced access to capital markets andor increased borrowing costs could reduce future net income and cash flows refer to note 14  “longterm debt” in the notes to consolidated financial statements for information related to outstanding longterm debt and maturities of that debt 

if any of these risks or uncertainties limit our access to the credit and capital markets or significantly increase our cost of capital it could limit our ability to implement or increase the costs of implementing our business plan which in turn could materially and adversely affect our results of operations cash flows financial condition and liquidity 

capital market performance and other factors may decrease the value of benefit plan assets which then could require significant additional funding and impact earnings 

the performance of the capital markets affects the value of the assets that are held in trust to satisfy future obligations under defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans we have significant obligations in these areas and hold significant assets in these trusts as noted in note 11  pension and other postretirement benefits in the notes to consolidated financial statements these assets are subject to market fluctuations and may yield uncertain returns which fall below our projected rates of return a decline in the market value of assets may increase the funding requirements of the obligations under the defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans additionally changes in interest rates affect the liabilities under these benefit plans as interest rates decrease the liabilities increase which could potentially increase funding requirements further the funding requirements of the obligations related to these benefits plans may increase due to changes in governmental regulations and participant demographics including increased numbers of retirements or changes in life expectancy assumptions in addition lower asset returns result in increased expenses ultimately significant funding requirements and increased pension or other postretirement benefit plan expense could negatively impact our results of operations and financial position

the majority of our revenues are subject to economic regulation and are exposed to the impact of regulatory rate reviews and proceedings 

most of our revenues are subject to economic regulation at either the federal or state level as such the revenues generated by us are subject to regulatory review by the applicable federal or state authority these rate reviews determine the rates charged to customers and directly impact revenues our financial results are dependent on frequent regulatory proceedings in order to ensure timely recovery of costs and investments in addition to our ongoing regulatory proceedings the recovery of the greater lawrence pipeline replacement capital investment will be addressed in a future regulatory proceeding as discussed in note 19  other commitments and contingencies  e other matters” in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

the outcomes of these proceedings are uncertain potentially lengthy and could be influenced by many factors some of which may be outside of our control including the cost of providing service the necessity of expenditures the quality of service regulatory interpretations customer intervention economic conditions and the political environment further the rate orders are subject to appeal which creates additional uncertainty as to the rates that will ultimately be allowed to be charged for services additionally the costs of complying with current and future changes in environmental and federal pipeline safety laws and regulations are expected to be significant and their recovery through rates will also be contingent on regulatory approval 

failure to adapt to advances in technology and manage the related costs could make us less competitive and negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition 

a key element of our business model is that generating power at central station power plants achieves economies of scale and produces power at a competitive cost we continue to research plan for and implement new technologies that produce power or reduce power consumption these technologies include renewable energy distributed generation energy storage and energy efficiency advances in technology and changes in laws or regulations including subsidization are reducing the cost of these or other alternative methods of producing power to a level that is competitive with that of most central station power electric production or result in smallerscale more fuel efficient andor more costeffective distributed generation this could cause power sales to decline and the value of our generating facilities to decline new technologies may require us to make significant expenditures to remain competitive and may result in the obsolescence of certain operating assets 

in addition customers are increasingly expecting enhanced communications regarding their electric and natural gas services which in some cases may involve additional investments in technology we also rely on technology to adequately maintain key business records 

our future success will depend in part on our ability to anticipate and successfully adapt to technological changes to offer services that meet customer demands and evolving industry standards and to recover all or a significant portion of any unrecovered investment in obsolete assets a failure by us to effectively adapt to changes in technology and manage the related costs could harm our ability to remain competitive in the marketplace for our products services and processes and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition 

the greater lawrence incident has materially adversely affected and may continue to materially adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

in connection with the greater lawrence incident we have incurred and will incur various costs and expenses as set forth in note 6 goodwill and other intangible assets note 19  other commitments and contingencies  c legal proceedings and “ e other matters in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

we are subject to inquiries and investigations by government authorities and regulatory agencies regarding the greater lawrence incident including the massachusetts dpu and the massachusetts attorney generals office we are cooperating with all inquiries and investigations in addition on february 26 2020 the company and columbia of massachusetts entered into agreements with the us attorney’s office to resolve the us attorney’s office’s investigation relating to the greater lawrence incident as described further below 

as more information becomes known managements estimates and assumptions regarding the costs and expenses to be incurred and the financial impact of the greater lawrence incident may change a change in management’s estimates or assumptions could result in an adjustment that would have a material impact on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows during the period in which such change occurred 

while we have recovered the full amount of our liability insurance coverage available under our policies total expenses related to the incident have exceeded such amount expenses in excess of our liability insurance coverage have materially adversely affected and may continue to materially adversely affect our results of operations cash flows and financial position

we may also incur additional costs associated with the greater lawrence incident beyond the amount currently anticipated including in connection with investigations by regulators as well as civil litigation further state or federal legislation may be enacted that would require us to incur additional costs by mandating various changes including changes to our operating practice standards for natural gas distribution operations and safety if we are unable to recover the capital cost of the gas pipeline replacement in the impacted area or we incur a material amount of other costs that we are unable to recover through rates or offset through operational or other cost savings our financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

further if it is determined in other matters that we did not comply with applicable statutes regulations rules tariffs or orders in connection with the greater lawrence incident or in connection with the operations or maintenance of our natural gas system and we are ordered to pay additional amounts in customer refunds penalties or other amounts our financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

our settlement with the us attorney’s office in respect of federal charges in connection with the greater lawrence incident may expose us to further penalties liabilities and private litigation and may impact our operations 

on february 26 2020 the company entered into a dpa and columbia of massachusetts entered into a plea agreement with the us attorney’s office to resolve the us attorney’s office’s investigation relating to the greater lawrence incident columbia of massachusetts’ plea agreement with the us attorney’s office is subject to approval by the united states district court for the district of massachusetts the court if columbia of massachusetts’ guilty plea is not accepted by the court or is withdrawn for any reason the us attorneys office may at its sole option render the dpa null and void see note 19 “other commitments and contingencies  c legal proceedings” in the notes to consolidated financial statements the agreements impose various compliance and remedial obligations on the company and columbia of massachusetts failure to comply with the terms of these agreements could result in further enforcement action by the us attorney’s office expose the company and columbia of massachusetts to penalties financial or otherwise and subjects the company to further private litigation each of which could impact our operations and have a material adverse effect on our business 

the closing of the sale of the massachusetts business is subject to receipt of clearance and approval from various governmental entities and other closing conditions that may not be satisfied or waived and in order to receive such clearance consent or approval governmental entities may impose conditions terms obligations or restrictions that eversource is not obligated to accept in order to complete the transaction 

on february 26 2020 nisource columbia of massachusetts and eversource entered into the asset purchase agreement providing for the sale of the massachusetts business to eversource the asset purchase agreement provides for various closing conditions including a the expiration or termination of the waiting period under the hartscottrodino antitrust improvements act of 1976 b the receipt of the approval of the massachusetts dpu the “mdpu approval” and c the final resolution or termination of all pending actions claims and proceedings against seller and its affiliates under the jurisdiction of the massachusetts dpu and all future actions claims and proceedings against seller and its affiliates relating to the greater lawrence incident under the jurisdiction of the massachusetts dpu 

the satisfaction of many of the closing conditions is beyond our control we may not receive the required clearance and approvals for the transaction or the required resolution with the massachusetts dpu or we may not receive them in a timely manner in addition governmental entities could impose conditions terms obligations or restrictions as conditions for their approvals and as conditions to resolve certain proceedings and these may include substantial payments by us moreover eversource is not required to agree to any conditions terms obligations or restrictions to obtain required clearance and approvals if such conditions terms obligations or restrictions would reasonably be expected to constitute a “burdensome condition” as defined in the asset purchase agreement there can be no assurance that regulators will not seek to impose conditions terms obligations or restrictions that would constitute burdensome conditions 

if the closing conditions are not satisfied or there is a substantial delay in obtaining the required clearance and approvals or otherwise satisfying the closing conditions the sale of the massachusetts business may not be completed and we may lose some or all of the intended benefits of the sale 

the sale of the massachusetts business poses risks and challenges that could negatively impact our business and we may not realize the expected benefits of the sale of the massachusetts business 

the sale of the massachusetts business involves separation or carveout activities and costs and possible disputes with eversource following the sale we may have continued financial liabilities with respect to the business conducted by columbia of massachusetts

as we will be required to retain responsibility for and indemnify eversource against certain liabilities including liabilities for any fines arising out of the greater lawrence incident and liabilities of columbia of massachusetts or its affiliates pursuant to civil claims for injury of persons or damage to property to the extent such injury or damage occurs prior to the closing in connection with columbia of massachusetts’ business it may also be difficult to determine whether a claim from a third party is our responsibility and we may expend substantial resources trying to determine whether we or eversource has responsibility for the claim 

if we do not realize the expected benefits of the sale of the massachusetts business our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be negatively impacted the sale of the massachusetts business may result in a dilutive impact to our future earnings if we are unable to offset the dilutive impact from the loss of revenue associated with the sale which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

the failure to complete the transactions contemplated by the asset purchase agreement within the expected time frame or at all could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations and the price of our common stock 

if the sale of the massachusetts business is not completed by october 26 2020 subject to up to two automatic 45day extensions under certain circumstances related to obtaining required regulatory approvals and resolution with the massachusetts dpu we or eversource may choose not to proceed with the transaction completion of the transaction is subject to risks including the risks that approval of the transaction by governmental entities will not be obtained or that certain other closing conditions will not be satisfied a failure to complete the transaction may result in negative publicity and a negative impression of us in the investment community moreover under the terms of the settlement with the us attorney’s office we will be obligated to use reasonable best efforts to sell columbia of massachusetts’ business and there is no assurance that we will be able to sell such business to a third party on as favorable terms if at all the occurrence of any of these events individually or in combination could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition or the trading price of our common stock 

our gas distribution activities as well as generation transmission and distribution of electricity involve a variety of inherent hazards and operating risks including potential public safety risks 

our gas distribution activities as well as generation transmission and distribution of electricity involve a variety of inherent hazards and operating risks including but not limited to gas leaks and overpressurization downed power lines damage to our infrastructure by third parties outages environmental spills mechanical problems and other incidents which could cause substantial financial losses as demonstrated in part by the greater lawrence incident in addition these hazards and risks have resulted and may in the future result in serious injury or loss of life to employees andor the general public significant damage to property environmental pollution impairment of our operations adverse regulatory rulings and reputational harm which in turn could lead to substantial losses for us the location of pipeline facilities or generation transmission substation and distribution facilities near populated areas including residential areas commercial business centers and industrial sites could increase the level of damages resulting from such incidents as with the greater lawrence incident certain incidents have subjected and may in the future subject us to litigation or administrative or other legal proceedings from time to time both civil and criminal which could result in substantial monetary judgments fines or penalties against us be resolved on unfavorable terms and require us to incur significant operational expenses the occurrence of incidents has in certain instances adversely affected and could in the future adversely affect our reputation cash flows financial position andor results of operations we maintain insurance against some but not all of these risks and losses 

we may be unable to obtain insurance on acceptable terms or at all our liability insurance coverage did not provide protection against all significant losses as a result of the greater lawrence incident and may not provide protection against all significant losses in the future 

our ability to obtain insurance as well as the cost and coverage of such insurance are affected by developments affecting our business international national state or local events and the financial condition of insurers the insurance market is experiencing a hardening environment due to reductions in commercial suppliers and the capacity they are willing to issue increases in overall demand for capacity and a prevalence of severe losses nisource has been particularly affected by the current market conditions we have not been able to obtain liability insurance coverage at previously procured limits at rates that are acceptable to us insurance coverage may not continue to be available at limits rates or terms acceptable to us the premiums we pay for our insurance coverage have significantly increased as a result of market conditions and the accumulated loss ratio over the history of nisource operations and we expect that they will continue to increase as a result of market conditions in addition our insurance is not sufficient or effective under all circumstances and against all hazards or liabilities to which we are subject for example total expenses related to the greater lawrence incident have exceeded the total amount of liability coverage available under our policies 

item 1a risk factors 

n i s ource i nc  

also certain types of damages expenses or claimed costs such as fines and penalties may be excluded under the policies in addition insurers providing insurance to us may raise defenses to coverage under the terms and conditions of the respective insurance policies that could result in a denial of coverage or limit the amount of insurance proceeds available to us any losses for which we are not fully insured or that are not covered by insurance at all could materially adversely affect our results of operations cash flows and financial position for example expenses related to the greater lawrence incident that we are unable to recover from liability or property insurance have materially adversely affected and may continue to materially adversely affect our results of operations for more information regarding our insurance programs in the context of the greater lawrence incident see note 19  other commitments and contingencies  c legal proceedings and   e other matters in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

the outcome of legal and regulatory proceedings investigations inquiries claims and litigation related to our business operations including those related to the greater lawrence incident may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position or liquidity 

we are involved in legal and regulatory proceedings investigations inquiries claims and litigation in connection with our business operations including the greater lawrence incident the most significant of which are summarized in note 19  “other commitments and contingencies” in the notes to consolidated financial statements our insurance does not cover all costs and expenses that we have incurred and that we may incur in the future relating to the greater lawrence incident and may not fully cover other incidents that may occur in the future due to the inherent uncertainty of the outcomes of such matters there can be no assurance that the resolution of any particular claim or proceeding would not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position or liquidity certain matters in connection with the greater lawrence incident have had or may have a material impact as described in note 19 other commitments and contingencies in the notes to consolidated financial statements if one or more of such additional or other matters were decided against us the effects could be material to our results of operations in the period in which we would be required to record or adjust the related liability and could also be material to our cash flows in the periods that we would be required to pay such liability 

we are exposed to significant reputational risks which make us vulnerable to a loss of cost recovery increased litigation and negative public perception 

as a utility company we are subject to adverse publicity focused on the reliability of our services the speed with which we are able to respond effectively to electric outages natural gas leaks or events and related accidents and similar interruptions caused by storm damage or other unanticipated events as well as our own or third parties actions or failure to act we are also subject to adverse publicity related to actual or perceived environmental impacts if customers legislators or regulators have or develop a negative opinion of us this could result in less favorable legislative and regulatory outcomes or increased regulatory oversight increased litigation and negative public perception the adverse publicity and investigations we experienced as a result of the greater lawrence incident may have an ongoing negative impact on the public’s perception of us it is difficult to predict the ultimate impact of this adverse publicity the foregoing may have continuing adverse effects on our business results of operations cash flow and financial condition 

our businesses are subject to various laws regulations and tariffs we could be materially adversely affected if we fail to comply with such laws regulations and tariffs or with any changes in or new interpretations of such laws regulations and tariffs 

our businesses are subject to various laws regulations and tariffs including but not limited to those relating to natural gas pipeline safety employee safety the environment and our energy infrastructure existing laws regulations and tariffs may be revised or become subject to new interpretations and new laws regulations and tariffs may be adopted or become applicable to us and our operations in some cases compliance with new laws regulations and tariffs increases our costs if we fail to comply with laws regulations and tariffs applicable to us or with any changes in or new interpretations of such laws regulations or tariffs our financial condition results of operations regulatory outcomes and cash flows may be materially adversely affected 

our businesses are regulated under numerous environmental laws the cost of compliance with these laws and changes to or additions to or reinterpretations of the laws could be significant liability from the failure to comply with existing or changed laws could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

our businesses are subject to extensive federal state and local environmental laws and rules that regulate among other things air emissions water usage and discharges ghg and waste products such as coal combustion residuals compliance with these legal obligations require us to make expenditures for installation of pollution control equipment remediation environmental monitoring emissions fees and permits at many of our facilities these expenditures are significant and we expect that they will continue to 

item 1a risk factors 

n i s ource i nc  

be significant in the future furthermore if we fail to comply with environmental laws and regulations or are found to have caused damage to the environment or persons that failure or harm may result in the assessment of civil or criminal penalties and damages against us and injunctions to remedy the failure or harm 

existing environmental laws and regulations may be revised and new laws and regulations seeking to change environmental regulation of the energy industry may be adopted or become applicable to us with an increased focus on both coal and natural gas in recent years revised or additional laws and regulations may result in significant additional expense and operating restrictions on our facilities or increased compliance costs which may not be fully recoverable from customers through regulated rates and could therefore impact our financial position financial results and cash flow moreover such costs could materially affect the continued economic viability of one or more of our facilities 

an area of significant uncertainty and risk are the laws concerning emission of ghg while we continue to reduce ghg emissions through the retirement of coalfired electric generation priority pipeline replacement energy efficiency leak detection and repair and other programs and expect to further reduce ghg emissions through increased use of renewable energy ghg emissions are currently an expected aspect of the electric and natural gas business revised or additional future ghg legislation andor regulation related to the generation of electricity or the extraction production distribution transmission storage and end use of natural gas could materially impact our gas supply financial position financial results and cash flows 

even in instances where legal and regulatory requirements are already known or anticipated the original cost estimates for environmental improvements remediation of past environmental impact or pollution reduction strategies and equipment can differ materially from the amount ultimately expended the actual future expenditures depend on many factors including the nature and extent of impact the method of improvement the cost of raw materials contractor costs and requirements established by environmental authorities changes in costs and the ability to recover under regulatory mechanisms could affect our financial position financial results and cash flows 

a significant portion of the gas and electricity we sell is used by residential and commercial customers for heating and air conditioning accordingly fluctuations in weather gas and electricity commodity costs and economic conditions impact demand of our customers and our operating results 

energy sales are sensitive to variations in weather forecasts of energy sales are based on “normal” weather which represents a longterm historical average significant variations from normal weather could have and have had a material impact on energy sales additionally residential usage and to some degree commercial usage is sensitive to fluctuations in commodity costs for gas and electricity whereby usage declines with increased costs thus affecting our financial results lastly residential and commercial customers’ usage is sensitive to economic conditions and factors such as unemployment consumption and consumer confidence therefore prevailing economic conditions affecting the demand of our customers may in turn affect our financial results 

our business operations are subject to economic conditions in certain industries 

business operations throughout our service territories have been and may continue to be adversely affected by economic events at the national and local level where it operates in particular sales to large industrial customers such as those in the steel oil refining industrial gas and related industries may be impacted by economic downturns and geographic or technological shifts in production or production methods the us manufacturing industry continues to adjust to changing market conditions including international competition increasing costs and fluctuating demand for its products 

the implementation of nipsco’s electric generation strategy including the retirement of its coal generation units may not achieve intended results 

on october 31 2018 nipsco submitted its 2018 integrated resource plan with the iurc setting forth its short and longterm electric generation plans in an effort to maintain affordability while providing reliable flexible and cleaner sources of power the plan evaluated demandside and supplyside resource alternatives to reliably and costeffectively meet nipsco customers future energy requirements over the ensuing 20 years the preferred option within the integrated resource plan sets forth a schedule to retire rm schahfer generating station units 14 15 17 and 18 in 2023 and michigan city generating station unit 12 in 2028 the current replacement plan includes renewable sources of energy including wind solar and battery storage 

as part of this plan nipsco has iurc approval for the jordan creek ppa for 400 mw the indiana crossroads bta for 300 mw and the rosewater bta for 100 mw each is a separate facility and all mw are nameplate capacity nipsco has filed a notice with the iurc of its intention not to move forward with one of its approved ppas due to the failure to meet a condition precedent in the agreement as a result of local zoning restrictions 

item 1a risk factors 

n i s ource i nc  

there are inherent risks and uncertainties in executing the integrated resource plan including changes in market conditions regulatory approvals environmental regulations commodity costs and customer expectations which may impede nipsco’s ability to achieve the intended results nipsco’s future success will depend in part on its ability to successfully implement its longterm electric generation plans to offer services that meet customer demands and evolving industry standards and to recover all or a significant portion of any unrecovered investment in obsolete assets nipsco’s electric generation strategy could require significant future capital expenditures operating costs and charges to earnings that may negatively impact our financial position financial results and cash flows 

fluctuations in the price of energy commodities or their related transportation costs or an inability to obtain an adequate reliable and costeffective fuel supply to meet customer demands may have a negative impact on our financial results 

our electric generating fleet is dependent on coal and natural gas for fuel and our gas distribution operations purchase and resell much of the natural gas we deliver to our customers these energy commodities are vulnerable to price fluctuations and fluctuations in associated transportation costs from time to time we have also used hedging in order to offset fluctuations in commodity supply prices we rely on regulatory recovery mechanisms in the various jurisdictions in order to fully recover the commodity costs incurred in providing service however while we have historically been successful in the recovery of costs related to such commodity prices there can be no assurance that such costs will be fully recovered through rates in a timely manner 

in addition we depend on electric transmission lines natural gas pipelines and other transportation facilities owned and operated by third parties to deliver the electricity and natural gas we sell to wholesale markets supply natural gas to our gas storage and electric generation facilities and provide retail energy services to customers if transportation is disrupted or if capacity is inadequate we may be unable to sell and deliver our gas and electric services to some or all of our customers as a result we may be required to procure additional or alternative electricity andor natural gas supplies at thencurrent market rates which if recovery of related costs is disallowed could have a material adverse effect on our businesses financial condition cash flows results of operations andor prospects 

we are exposed to risk that customers will not remit payment for delivered energy or services and that suppliers or counterparties will not perform under various financial or operating agreements 

our extension of credit is governed by a corporate credit risk policy involves considerable judgment by our employees and is based on an evaluation of a customer or counterparty’s financial condition credit history and other factors we monitor our credit risk exposure by obtaining credit reports and updated financial information for customers and suppliers and by evaluating the financial status of our banking partners and other counterparties by reference to marketbased metrics such as credit default swap pricing levels and to traditional credit ratings provided by the major credit rating agencies adverse economic conditions could result in an increase in defaults by customers suppliers and counterparties 

we have significant goodwill and definitelived intangible assets impairments of goodwill and definitelived intangible assets related to columbia of massachusetts have resulted in significant charges to earnings for the quarter and year ended december 31 2019 any future impairments of other goodwill could result in a significant charge to earnings in a future period and negatively impact our compliance with certain covenants under financing agreements 

in accordance with gaap we test goodwill for impairment at least annually and review our definitelived intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate its fair value might be below its carrying value goodwill is also tested for impairment when factors examples of which include reduced cash flow estimates a sustained decline in stock price or market capitalization below book value indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 

we are required to record a charge in our financial statements for a period in which any impairment of our goodwill or definitelived intangible assets is determined negatively impacting our results of operations in connection with the preparation of our financial statements for the year ended december 31 2019  we conducted an impairment analysis for the goodwill and definitelived intangible assets franchise rights related to columbia of massachusetts and concluded that such goodwill and franchise rights were impaired as a result we recorded an impairment charge of 2048 million for such goodwill and an impairment charge of 2097 million for such franchise rights at december 31 2019  for additional information see note 6  “goodwill and other intangible assets” in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

a significant charge in the future could impact the capitalization ratio covenant under certain financing agreements we are subject to a financial covenant under our revolving credit facility and term loan agreement which require us to maintain a debt to capitalization ratio that does not exceed 70 a similar covenant in a 2005 private placement note purchase agreement requires us to maintain a debt to capitalization ratio that does not exceed 75 as of december 31 2019  the ratio was 617

changes in taxation and the ability to quantify such changes as well as challenges to tax positions could adversely affect our financial results 

we are subject to taxation by the various taxing authorities at the federal state and local levels where we do business legislation or regulation which could affect our tax burden could be enacted by any of these governmental authorities for example the tcja includes numerous provisions that affect businesses including changes to us corporate tax rates businessrelated exclusions and deductions and credits the outcome of regulatory proceedings regarding the extent to which the effect of a change in corporate tax rate will impact customers and the time period over which the impact will occur could significantly impact future earnings and cash flows separately a challenge by a taxing authority changes in taxing authorities’ administrative interpretations decisions policies and positions our ability to utilize tax benefits such as carryforwards or tax credits or a deviation from other taxrelated assumptions may cause actual financial results to deviate from previous estimates 

changes in accounting principles may adversely affect our financial results 

future changes in accounting rules and associated changes in regulatory accounting may negatively impact the way we record revenues expenses assets and liabilities these changes in accounting standards may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

aging infrastructure may lead to disruptions in operations and increased capital expenditures and maintenance costs all of which could negatively impact our financial results 

we have risks associated with aging infrastructure including our gas infrastructure assets these risks can be driven by threats such as but not limited to internal corrosion external corrosion and stress corrosion cracking the age of these assets may result in a need for replacement a higher level of maintenance costs or unscheduled outages despite efforts by us to properly maintain or upgrade these assets through inspection scheduled maintenance and capital investment in addition the nature of the information available on aging infrastructure assets which in some cases is incomplete may make inspections maintenance upgrading and replacement of the assets particularly challenging additionally missing or incorrect infrastructure data may lead to 1 difficulty properly locating facilities which can result in excavator damage and operational or emergency response issues and 2 configuration and control risks associated with the modification of system operating pressures in connection with turning off or turning on service to customers which can result in unintended outages or operating pressures also additional maintenance and inspections are required in some instances in order to improve infrastructure information and records and address emerging regulatory or risk management requirements which increases our costs the failure to operate these assets as desired could result in gas leaks and other incidents and in our inability to meet firm service obligations which could adversely impact revenues and could also result in increased capital expenditures and maintenance costs which if not fully recovered from customers could negatively impact our financial results 

the impacts of climate change natural disasters acts of terrorism accidents or other catastrophic events may disrupt operations and reduce the ability to service customers 

a disruption or failure of natural gas distribution systems or within electric generation transmission or distribution systems in the event of a major hurricane tornado terrorist attack cyberattack as further detailed below accident or other catastrophic event could cause delays in completing sales providing services or performing other critical functions we have experienced disruptions in the past from hurricanes and tornadoes and other events of this nature the occurrence of such events could adversely affect our financial position and results of operations in accordance with customary industry practice we maintain insurance against some but not all of these risks and losses there is also a concern that climate change may exacerbate the risks to physical infrastructure such risks include heat stresses to power lines storms that damage infrastructure lake and sea level changes that affect the manner in which services are currently provided droughts or other stresses on water used to supply services and other extreme weather conditions climate change and the costs that may be associated with its impacts have the potential to affect our business in many ways including increasing the costs we incur in providing our products and services impacting the demand for and consumption of our products and services due to change in both costs and weather patterns and affecting the economic health of the regions in which we operate

a cyberattack on any of our or certain thirdparty computer systems upon which we rely may adversely affect our ability to operate and could lead to a loss or misuse of confidential and proprietary information or potential liability 

we are reliant on technology to run our business which is dependent upon financial and operational computer systems to process critical information necessary to conduct various elements of our business including the generation transmission and distribution of electricity operation of our gas pipeline facilities and the recording and reporting of commercial and financial transactions to regulators investors and other stakeholders in addition to general information and cyber risks that all large corporations face eg malware unauthorized access attempts phishing attacks malicious intent by insiders and inadvertent disclosure of sensitive information the utility industry faces evolving and increasingly complex cybersecurity risks associated with protecting sensitive and confidential customer information electric grid infrastructure and natural gas infrastructure deployment of new business technologies represents a new and largescale opportunity for attacks on our information systems and confidential customer information as well as on the integrity of the energy grid and the natural gas infrastructure increasing largescale corporate attacks in conjunction with more sophisticated threats continue to challenge power and utility companies any failure of our computer systems or those of our customers suppliers or others with whom we do business could materially disrupt our ability to operate our business and could result in a financial loss and possibly do harm to our reputation 

additionally our information systems experience ongoing often sophisticated cyberattacks by a variety of sources including foreign sources with the apparent aim to breach our cyberdefenses although we attempt to maintain adequate defenses to these attacks and work through industry groups and trade associations to identify common threats and assess our countermeasures a security breach of our information systems or a security breach of the information systems of our customers suppliers or others with whom we do business could i impact the reliability of our generation transmission and distribution systems and potentially negatively impact our compliance with certain mandatory reliability standards ii subject us to reputational and other harm or liabilities associated with theft or inappropriate release of certain types of information such as system operating information or information personal or otherwise relating to our customers or employees iii impact our ability to manage our businesses andor iv subject us to legal and regulatory proceedings and claims from third parties in addition to remediation costs any of which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our businesses cash flows financial condition results of operations andor prospects although we do maintain cyber insurance it is possible that such insurance will not adequately cover any losses or liabilities we may incur as a result of any cybersecurityrelated litigation 

our capital projects and programs subject us to construction risks and natural gas costs and supply risks and require numerous permits approvals and certificates from various governmental agencies 

our business requires substantial capital expenditures for investments in among other things capital improvements to our electric generating facilities electric and natural gas distribution infrastructure natural gas storage and other projects including projects for environmental compliance we are engaged in intrastate natural gas pipeline modernization programs to maintain system integrity and enhance service reliability and flexibility nipsco also is currently engaged in a number of capital projects including environmental improvements to its electric generating stations the construction of new transmission facilities and new projects related to renewable energy as we undertake these projects and programs we may be unable to complete them on schedule or at the anticipated costs additionally we may construct or purchase some of these projects and programs to capture anticipated future growth in natural gas production which may not materialize and may cause the construction to occur over an extended period of time 

our existing and planned capital projects require numerous permits approvals and certificates from federal state and local governmental agencies if there is a delay in obtaining any required regulatory approvals or if we fail to obtain or maintain any required approvals or to comply with any applicable laws or regulations we may not be able to construct or operate our facilities we may be forced to incur additional costs or we may be unable to recover any or all amounts invested in a project we also may not receive the anticipated increases in revenue and cash flows resulting from such projects and programs until after their completion other construction risks include changes in costs of materials equipment commodities or labor including changes to tariffs on materials delays caused by construction incidents or injuries work stoppages shortages in qualified labor poor initial cost estimates unforeseen engineering issues the ability to obtain necessary rightsofway easements and transmissions connections and general contractors and subcontractors not performing as required under their contracts 

to the extent that delays occur costs become unrecoverable or we otherwise become unable to effectively manage and complete our capital projects our results of operations cash flows and financial condition may be adversely affected 

sustained extreme weather conditions may negatively impact our operations

failure to attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce and maintain good labor relations could harm our results of operations 

we operate in an industry that requires many of our employees to possess unique technical skill sets events such as an aging workforce without appropriate replacements the mismatch of skill sets to future needs or the unavailability of contract resources may lead to operating challenges or increased costs these operating challenges include lack of resources loss of knowledge and a lengthy time period associated with skill development in addition current and prospective employees may determine that they do not wish to work for us due to market economic employment and other conditions failure to hire and retain qualified employees including the ability to transfer significant internal historical knowledge and expertise to the new employees may adversely affect our ability to manage and operate our business if we are unable to successfully attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce safety service reliability customer satisfaction and our results of operations could be adversely affected 

some of our employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements our collective bargaining agreements are generally negotiated on an operating company basis any failure to reach an agreement on new labor contracts or to negotiate these labor contracts might result in strikes boycotts or other labor disruptions labor disruptions strikes or significant negotiated wage and benefit increases whether due to union activities employee turnover or otherwise could have a material adverse effect on our businesses results of operations andor cash flows 

we are a holding company and are dependent on cash generated by our subsidiaries to meet our debt obligations and pay dividends on our stock 

we are a holding company and conduct our operations primarily through our subsidiaries which are separate and distinct legal entities substantially all of our consolidated assets are held by our subsidiaries accordingly our ability to meet our debt obligations or pay dividends on our common stock and preferred stock is largely dependent upon cash generated by these subsidiaries in the event a major subsidiary is not able to pay dividends or transfer cash flows to us our ability to service our debt obligations or pay dividends could be negatively affected 

if we cannot effectively manage new initiatives and organizational changes we will be unable to address the opportunities and challenges presented by our strategy and the business and regulatory environment 

in order to execute on our sustainable growth strategy and enhance our culture of ongoing continuous improvement we must effectively manage the complexity and frequency of new initiatives and organizational changes if we are unable to make decisions quickly assess our opportunities and risks and implement new governance managerial and organizational processes as needed to execute our strategy in this increasingly dynamic and competitive business and regulatory environment our financial condition results of operations and relationships with our business partners regulators customers and stockholders may be negatively impacted 

we outsource certain business functions to thirdparty suppliers and service providers and substandard performance by those third parties could harm our business reputation and results of operations 

utilities rely on extensive networks of business partners and suppliers to support critical enterprise capabilities across their organizations global metrics indicate that deliveries from suppliers are slowing and that labor shortages are occurring in the energy sector we outsource certain services to third parties in areas including construction services information technology materials fleet environmental operational services and other areas outsourcing of services to third parties could expose us to inferior service quality or substandard deliverables which may result in noncompliance including with applicable legal requirements and industry standards interruption of service or accidents or reputational harm which could negatively impact our results of operations if any difficulties in the operations of these thirdparty suppliers and service providers including their systems were to occur they could adversely affect our results of operations or adversely affect our ability to work with regulators unions customers or employees 

changes in the method for determining libor and the potential replacement of the libor benchmark interest rate could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

some of our indebtedness including borrowings under our revolving credit agreement and term loan agreement bears interest at a variable rate based on libor from time to time we also enter into hedging instruments to manage our exposure to fluctuations in the libor benchmark interest rate in addition these hedging instruments as well as hedging instruments that our subsidiaries 

item 1a risk factors 

n i s ource i nc  

use for hedging natural gas price and basis risk rely on liborbased rates to calculate interest accrued on certain payments that may be required to be made under these agreements such as late payments or interest accrued if any cash collateral should be held by a counterparty any changes announced by regulators in the method pursuant to which the libor rates are determined may result in a sudden or prolonged increase or decrease in the reported libor rates if that were to occur the level of interest payments we incur may change 

in july 2017 the united kingdom financial conduct authority “fca” which regulates libor announced that the fca intends to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of libor after 2021 it is not possible to predict the effect of these changes other reforms or the establishment of alternative reference rates in the united kingdom or elsewhere in the united states efforts to identify a set of alternative us dollar reference interest rates include proposals by the alternative reference rates committee of the federal reserve board and the federal reserve bank of new york the alternative reference rates committee has proposed the secured overnight financing rate sofr as its recommended alternative to libor and the federal reserve bank of new york began publishing sofr rates in april 2018 sofr is intended to be a broad measure of the cost of borrowing cash overnight that is collateralized by us treasury securities however because sofr is a broad us treasury repurchase agreement financing rate that represents overnight secured funding transactions it differs fundamentally from libor for example sofr is a secured overnight rate while libor is an unsecured rate that represents interbank funding over different maturities in addition because sofr is a transactionbased rate it is backwardlooking whereas libor is forwardlooking because of these and other differences there is no assurance that sofr will perform in the same way as libor would have performed at any time and there is no guarantee that it is a comparable substitute for libor sofr may fail to gain market acceptance 

in addition although certain of our libor based obligations provide for alternative methods of calculating the interest rate payable on certain of our obligations if libor is not reported which include without limitation requesting certain rates from major reference banks in london or new york uncertainty as to the extent and manner of future changes may result in interest rates andor payments that are higher than lower than or that do not otherwise correlate over time with the interest rates or payments that would have been made on our obligations if a liborbased rate was available in its current form

the process for estimating costs associated with thirdparty claims and fines penalties and settlements associated with government investigations relating to the greater lawrence incident requires management to exercise significant judgment based on a number of assumptions and subjective factors as more information becomes known including additional information regarding ongoing investigations management’s estimates and assumptions regarding the financial impact of the greater lawrence incident may change 

the aggregate amount of thirdparty liability insurance coverage available for losses arising from the greater lawrence incident is 800 million  we have collected the entire 800 million as of december 31 2019 expenses related to the incident have exceeded the total amount of insurance coverage available under our policies the following table presents activity related to our greater lawrence incident insurance recovery

summary of consolidated financial results 

our operations are affected by the cost of sales cost of sales for the gas distribution operations segment is principally comprised of the cost of natural gas used while providing transportation and distribution services to customers cost of sales for the electric operations segment is comprised of the cost of coal related handling costs natural gas purchased for the internal generation of electricity at nipsco and the cost of power purchased from thirdparty generators of electricity 

the majority of the cost of sales are tracked costs that are passed through directly to the customer resulting in an equal and offsetting amount reflected in operating revenues as a result we believe net revenues a nongaap financial measure defined as operating revenues less cost of sales excluding depreciation and amortization provides management and investors a useful measure to analyze profitability the presentation of net revenues herein is intended to provide supplemental information for investors regarding operating performance net revenues do not intend to represent operating income the most comparable gaap measure as an indicator of operating performance and is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies

for the years ended december 31 2019  2018 and 2017  operating income and a reconciliation of net revenues to the most directly comparable gaap measure operating income was as follows 





on a consolidated basis we reported net income available to common shareholders of 3280 million or 088 per basic share for the twelve months ended december 31 2019 compared to a loss to common shareholders of 656 million or 018 per basic share for the same period in 2018  the increase in net income available to common shareholders during 2019 was primarily due to lower operating expenses related to the greater lawrence incident insurance recoveries recorded related to the greater lawrence incident and new rates from base rate proceedings and infrastructure replacement programs these increases were partially offset by noncash impairments of goodwill and other intangible assets in 2019 related to columbia of massachusetts see note 6 goodwill and other intangible assets in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information higher income taxes see income taxes below higher depreciation expense due to regulatory outcomes at nipsco and columbia of ohio and additional dilution in 2019 resulting from preferred stock dividend commitments 

operating income 

for the twelve months ended december 31 2019  we reported operating income of 8907 million compared to 1247 million for the same period in 2018  the increased operating income was primarily due to decreased operating expenses related to the greater lawrence incident insurance recoveries recorded related to the greater lawrence incident and new rates from base rate proceedings and infrastructure replacement programs these increases were partially offset by noncash impairments of goodwill and other intangible assets in 2019 related to columbia of massachusetts see note 6  goodwill and other intangible asset in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information and increased depreciation due to the regulatory outcome of nipscos gas rate case and an increase in amortization of depreciation previously deferred as a regulatory asset resulting from columbia of ohios cep 

other deductions net 

other deductions net reduced income by 3841 million in 2019 compared to a reduction in income of 3553 million in 2018  this change is primarily due to lower actuarial investment returns on pension and other postretirement benefit assets of 346 million and an increase in interest expense of 256 million driven by decreased regulatory deferrals from columbia of ohios cep these unfavorable variances were partially offset by charitable contributions of 207 million in 2018 related to the greater lawrence incident 

income taxes 

the increase in income tax expense from 2018 to 2019 is primarily attributable to higher pretax income resulting from the items discussed above in operating income and other deductions net trueups to tax expense in 2018 to reflect regulatory outcomes associated with excess deferred income taxes and higher income tax expense in 2019 related to the nondeductible noncash impairment of goodwill fines and penalties

refer to “liquidity and capital resources” below and note 10  income taxes in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on income taxes and the change in the effective tax rate 

capital investment 

in 2019  we invested approximately 19 billion in capital expenditures across the gas and electric utilities these expenditures were primarily aimed at furthering the safety and reliability of our gas distribution system and maintaining our existing electric generation fleet 

we continue to execute on an estimated 30 billion in total projected longterm regulated utility infrastructure investments and expect to invest approximately 18 to 19 billion in capital during 2020 as we continue to focus on growth safety and modernization projects across our operating area 

liquidity 

a primary focus of ours is to ensure the availability of adequate financing to fund our ongoing safety and infrastructure investment programs which typically involves the issuance of debt andor equity in addition expenses related to the greater lawrence incident have exceeded the total amount of insurance coverage available under our policies during 2020 we plan to pursue alternatives to cover this shortfall including longterm financing and potential proceeds from the sale of the massachusetts business for additional information see note 26  subsequent event in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

through income generated from operating activities amounts available under our shortterm revolving credit facility commercial paper program accounts receivable securitization facilities term loan borrowings longterm debt agreements our ability to access the capital markets and the potential sale of the massachusetts business we believe there is adequate capital available to fund our operating activities and capital expenditures and the effects of the greater lawrence incident in 2020 and beyond at december 31 2019 and 2018  we had approximately 14091 million and 9746 million  respectively of net liquidity available consisting of cash and available capacity under credit facilities 

these factors and other impacts to the financial results are discussed in more detail within the following discussions of “results and discussion of segment operations” and “liquidity and capital resources” 

regulatory developments 

in 2019  we continued to move forward on core infrastructure and environmental investment programs supported by complementary regulatory and customer initiatives across all seven states of our operating area refer to note 8  “regulatory matters” and note 19 e other matters in the notes to consolidated financial statements for a complete discussion of key regulatory developments that transpired during 2019

 weather 

in general we calculate the weatherrelated revenue variance based on changing customer demand driven by weather variance from normal heating degree days our composite heating degree days reported do not directly correlate to the weatherrelated dollar impact on the results of gas distribution operations heating degree days experienced during different times of the year or in different operating locations may have more or less impact on volume and dollars depending on when and where they occur when the detailed results are combined for reporting there may be weatherrelated dollar impacts on operations when there is not an apparent or significant change in our aggregated composite heating degree day comparison 

the definition of “normal” weather was updated during the first quarter of 2019 to reflect more current weather pattern data and to more closely align with the regulators jurisdictional definitions of “normal” weather impacts of the change in methodology will be reflected prospectively and disclosed to the extent it results in notable yearoveryear variances in net revenues 

weather in the gas distribution operations service territories for 2019 was about 1 warmer than normal and about 3 warmer than 2018  however due to the aforementioned change in methodology the change in net revenues attributed to weather resulted in an increase of 74 million for the year ended december 31 2019 compared to 2018  the variance is detailed further below

 weather in the gas distribution operations service territories for 2018 was about 1 warmer than normal and about 13 colder than 2017  increasing net revenues 375 million for the year ended december 31 2018 compared to 2017  

throughput 

total volumes sold and transported for the year ended december 31 2019 were 10402 mmdth compared to 10536 mmdth for 2018  this decrease is primarily attributable to warmer weather experienced in 2019 compared to 2018 

total volumes sold and transported for the year ended december 31 2018 were 10536 mmdth compared to 9732 mmdth for 2017  this increase is primarily attributable to colder weather experienced in 2018 compared to 2017 

economic conditions 

all of our gas distribution operations companies have stateapproved recovery mechanisms that provide a means for full recovery of prudently incurred gas costs gas costs are treated as passthrough costs and have no impact on the net revenues recorded in the period the gas costs included in revenues are matched with the gas cost expense recorded in the period and the difference is recorded on the consolidated balance sheets as underrecovered or overrecovered gas cost to be included in future customer billings

greater lawrence incident as discussed in the executive summary and in note 19  “other commitments and contingencies” in the notes to consolidated financial statements we have recorded and paid costs associated with the greater lawrence incident and have invested capital to replace the entire affected 45mile cast iron and bare steel pipeline system that delivers gas to the impacted area as discussed in the executive summary note 19 referenced earlier in this paragraph and part i item 1a “risk factors” we may incur additional expenses and liabilities in excess of our recorded liabilities and estimated additional costs associated with the greater lawrence incident since the greater lawrence incident and through december 31 2019  we have collected 800 million from insurance providers however total costs related to the incident have exceeded the total amount of insurance coverage available under our policies to date this excess has primarily been funded through shortterm borrowings during 2020 we plan to pursue alternatives to these shortterm borrowings which include longterm financing and potential proceeds from the sale of the massachusetts business for additional information see note 26 “subsequent event” in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

operating activities 

net cash from operating activities for the year ended december 31 2019 was 15833 million  an increase of 10432 million from 2018  this increase was driven primarily by the receipt of 795 million of insurance recoveries in 2019 related to the greater lawrence incident and approximately 220 million lower cash spend for the greater lawrence incident in 2019 refer to note 19  other commitments and contingencies in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information related to the greater lawrence incident 

pension and other postretirement plan funding  in 2019 we contributed 29 million to our pension plans and 230 million to our other postretirement benefit plans in 2018 we contributed 29 million to our pension plans and 210 million to our other postretirement benefit plans given the current funded status of the pension plans and barring unforeseen market volatility that may negatively impact the valuation of our plan assets we do not believe additional material contributions to our pension plans will be required for the foreseeable future 

income taxes rates for our regulated customers include provisions for the collection of us federal income taxes the reduction in the us federal corporate income tax rate as a result of the tcja led to a decrease in the amount billed to customers through rates ultimately resulting in lower cash collections from operating activities in addition we are required to pass back to customers “excess deferred taxes” which represent amounts collected from customers in the past to cover deferred tax liabilities which as a result of the passage of the tcja are now less than the originally billed amounts approximately 15 billion of excess deferred taxes was recorded as a regulatory liability as of december 31 2017 as a result of implementing the tcja the majority of this balance related to temporary booktotax differences on utility property protected by irs normalization rules this portion of the excess deferred taxes balance will be passed back to customers over the remaining average useful life of the associated property as required by the tcja the remainder of the excess deferred tax balance is passed back over periods determined by our state utility commissions the pass back of excess deferred taxes has been approved in all our jurisdictions as of december 31 2019 we have approximately 13 billion of remaining regulatory liabilities associated with excess deferred taxes 

as of december 31 2019  we have a deferred tax asset of 6571 million related to a federal nol carryforward of which 4061 million relates to years prior to the implementation of the tcja as a result of being in an nol position we were not required to make any cash payments for federal income tax purposes during the three years ended december 31 2019  the carryforward periods for pretcja tax benefits expire in various tax years from 2028 to 2037  however we expect to fully utilize the carryforward benefit prior to its expiration according to the tcja utilization of nol carryforwards generated after december 31 2017 do not expire but are limited to 80 of current year taxable income accordingly we may be required to make cash payments for federal income taxes in future years despite having nol carryforwards in excess of current taxes payable

investing activities 

our cash used for investing activities varies year over year primarily as a result of changes in the level of annual capital expenditures the table below reflects capital expenditures and certain other investing activities by segment for 2019  2018 and 2017    



1 corporate and other capital expenditures were zero in 2018 as specific it assets were leased in 2018 certain it and other maintenance related assets were purchased in 2017 and 2019 

2 amounts differ from those presented on the statements of consolidated cash flows primarily due to the capitalized portion of the corporate incentive plan payout inclusion of capital expenditures included in current liabilities and afudc equity 

3 the 2018 capital expenditures for gas distribution operations reflects reclassifying the greater lawrence incident pipeline replacement from system growth and tracker to maintenance 

for 2019  capital expenditures and certain other investing activities were 18678 million  which was 532 million higher than the 2018 capital program this increased spending is primarily due to growth safety and system modernization projects 

for 2018  capital expenditures and certain other investing activities were 18146 million  which was 608 million higher than the 2017 capital program this increased spending is due in part to costs associated with the greater lawrence incident pipeline replacement gas transmission projects environmental investments and system modernization projects across all seven states in our operating area 

for 2020  we project to invest approximately 18 to 19 billion in our capital program this projected level of spend is consistent with 2019 spend levels and is expected to focus on growth safety and modernization projects across our operating area

our calculated estimated interest payments for longterm debt is based on the stated coupon and payment dates for 2020  we project that we will be required to make interest payments of approximately 3682 million which includes 3420 million of interest payments related to our longterm debt outstanding as of december 31 2019  at december 31 2019  we had 17732 million in shortterm borrowings outstanding 

our expected payments included within “other liabilities” in the table of contractual commitments above contains employer contributions to pension and other postretirement benefits plans expected to be made in 2020  plan contributions beyond 2020 are dependent upon a number of factors including actual returns on plan assets which cannot be reliably estimated at this time in 2020  we expect to make contributions of approximately 30 million to our pension plans and approximately 240 million to our postretirement medical and life plans refer to note 11  “pension and other postretirement benefits” in the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information

market risk disclosures 

risk is an inherent part of our businesses the extent to which we properly and effectively identify assess monitor and manage each of the various types of risk involved in our businesses is critical to our profitability we seek to identify assess monitor and manage in accordance with defined policies and procedures the following principal market risks that are involved in our businesses commodity price risk interest rate risk and credit risk risk management for us is a multifaceted process with oversight by the risk management committee that requires constant communication judgment and knowledge of specialized products and markets our senior management takes an active role in the risk management process and has developed policies and procedures that require specific administrative and business functions to assist in the identification assessment and control of various risks these may include but are not limited to market operational financial compliance and strategic risk types in recognition of the increasingly varied and complex nature of the energy business our risk management process policies and procedures continue to evolve and are subject to ongoing review and modification 

commodity price risk 

we are exposed to commodity price risk as a result of our subsidiaries’ operations involving natural gas and power to manage this market risk our subsidiaries use derivatives including commodity futures contracts swaps forwards and options we do not participate in speculative energy trading activity 

commodity price risk resulting from derivative activities at our rateregulated subsidiaries is limited since regulations allow recovery of prudently incurred purchased power fuel and gas costs through the ratemaking process including gains or losses on these derivative instruments if states should explore additional regulatory reform these subsidiaries may begin providing services without the benefit of the traditional ratemaking process and may be more exposed to commodity price risk 

our subsidiaries are required to make cash margin deposits with their brokers to cover actual and potential losses in the value of outstanding exchange traded derivative contracts the amount of these deposits some of which is reflected in our restricted cash balance may fluctuate significantly during periods of high volatility in the energy commodity markets 

refer to note 9  risk management activities in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information on our commodity price risk assets and liabilities as of december 31 2019 and 2018  

interest rate risk 

we are exposed to interest rate risk as a result of changes in interest rates on borrowings under our revolving credit agreement commercial paper program term loan agreement and accounts receivable programs which have interest rates that are indexed to shortterm market interest rates based upon average borrowings and debt obligations subject to fluctuations in shortterm market interest rates an increase or decrease in shortterm interest rates of 100 basis points 1 would have increased or decreased interest expense by 190 million and 133 million for 2019 and 2018  respectively we are also exposed to interest rate risk as a result of changes in benchmark rates that can influence the interest rates of future debt issuances 

refer to note 9  risk management activities in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information on our interest rate risk assets and liabilities as of december 31 2019 and 2018

credit risk 

due to the nature of the industry credit risk is embedded in many of our business activities our extension of credit is governed by a corporate credit risk policy in addition risk management committee guidelines are in place which document management approval levels for credit limits evaluation of creditworthiness and credit risk mitigation efforts exposures to credit risks are monitored by the risk management function which is independent of commercial operations credit risk arises due to the possibility that a customer supplier or counterparty will not be able or willing to fulfill its obligations on a transaction on or before the settlement date for derivativerelated contracts credit risk arises when counterparties are obligated to deliver or purchase defined commodity units of gas or power to us at a future date per execution of contractual terms and conditions exposure to credit risk is measured in terms of both current obligations and the market value of forward positions net of any posted collateral such as cash and letters of credit 

we closely monitor the financial status of our banking credit providers we evaluate the financial status of our banking partners through the use of marketbased metrics such as credit default swap pricing levels and also through traditional credit ratings provided by major credit rating agencies 

other information 

critical accounting policies 

we apply certain accounting policies based on the accounting requirements discussed below that have had and may continue to have significant impacts on our operations and consolidated financial statements 

basis of accounting for rateregulated subsidiaries asc topic 980 regulated operations  provides that rateregulated subsidiaries account for and report assets and liabilities consistent with the economic effect of the way in which regulators establish rates if the rates established are designed to recover the costs of providing the regulated service and if the competitive environment makes it probable that such rates can be charged and collected certain expenses and credits subject to utility regulation or rate determination normally reflected in income are deferred on the consolidated balance sheets and are recognized in income as the related amounts are included in service rates and recovered from or refunded to customers the total amounts of regulatory assets and liabilities reflected on the consolidated balance sheets were 22396 million and 25122 million at december 31 2019  and 22375 million and 26600 million at december 31 2018  respectively for additional information refer to note 8  “regulatory matters” in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

in the event that regulation significantly changes the opportunity for us to recover our costs in the future all or a portion of our regulated operations may no longer meet the criteria for the application of asc topic 980 regulated operations  in such event a writedown of all or a portion of our existing regulatory assets and liabilities could result if transition cost recovery is approved by the appropriate regulatory bodies that would meet the requirements under gaap for continued accounting as regulatory assets and liabilities during such recovery period the regulatory assets and liabilities would be reported at the recoverable amounts if we were unable to continue to apply the provisions of asc topic 980 regulated operations  we would be required to apply the provisions of asc topic 98020 discontinuation of rateregulated accounting  in management’s opinion our regulated subsidiaries will be subject to asc topic 980 regulated operations for the foreseeable future 

certain of the regulatory assets reflected on our consolidated balance sheets require specific regulatory action in order to be included in future service rates although recovery of these amounts is not guaranteed we believe that these costs meet the requirements for deferral as regulatory assets regulatory assets requiring specific regulatory action amounted to 3072 million at december 31 2019  if we determine that the amounts included as regulatory assets were not recoverable a charge to income would immediately be required to the extent of the unrecoverable amounts 

the passage of the tcja into law in december 2017 necessitated the remeasurement of our deferred income tax balances to reflect the change in the statutory federal tax rate from 35 to 21 for our regulated entities substantially all of the impact of this remeasurement was recorded to a regulatory liability and is being passed backed to customers as established during the rate making process for additional information refer to note 8  regulatory matters and note 10  income taxes in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

as discussed in note 19e other matters  greater lawrence pipeline replacement since the greater lawrence incident and through december 31 2019 we have invested approximately 258 million of capital spend for the pipeline replacement in the affected communities this work was completed in 2019 we maintain property insurance for gas pipelines and other applicable property columbia of massachusetts has filed a proof of loss with its property insurer for the full cost of the pipeline replacement in january 2020 we filed a lawsuit against the property insurer seeking payment of our property claim we are currently unable

to predict the timing or amount of any insurance recovery under the property policy the recovery of any capital investment not reimbursed through insurance will be addressed in a future regulatory proceeding a future regulatory proceeding is dependent on the outcome of the sale of the massachusetts business the outcome of such a proceeding if any is uncertain in accordance with asc 980360 if it becomes probable that a portion of the pipeline replacement cost will not be recoverable through customer rates and an amount can be reasonably estimated we will reduce our regulated plant balance for the amount of the probable disallowance and record an associated charge to earnings this could result in a material adverse effect to our financial condition results of operations and cash flows additionally if a rate order is received allowing recovery of the investment with no or reduced return on investment a loss on disallowance may be required 

pension and postretirement benefits we have defined benefit plans for both pension and other postretirement benefits the calculation of the net obligations and annual expense related to the plans requires a significant degree of judgment regarding the discount rates to be used in bringing the liabilities to present value expected longterm rates of return on plan assets health care trend rates and mortality rates among other assumptions due to the size of the plans and the longterm nature of the associated liabilities changes in the assumptions used in the actuarial estimates could have material impacts on the measurement of the net obligations and annual expense recognition differences between actuarial assumptions and actual plan results are deferred into aoci or a regulatory balance sheet account depending on the jurisdiction of our entity these deferred gains or losses are then amortized into the income statement when the accumulated differences exceed 10 of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or the fair value of plan assets known in gaap as the “corridor” method or when settlement accounting is triggered 

the discount rates expected longterm rates of return on plan assets health care cost trend rates and mortality rates are critical assumptions methods used to develop these assumptions are described below while a third party actuarial firm assists with the development of many of these assumptions we are ultimately responsible for selecting the final assumptions 

the discount rate is utilized principally in calculating the actuarial present value of pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit plan costs our discount rates for both pension and other postretirement benefits are determined using spot rates along an aarated above median yield curve with cash flows matching the expected duration of benefit payments to be made to plan participants 

the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets is a component utilized in calculating annual pension and other postretirement benefit plan costs we estimate the expected return on plan assets by evaluating expected bond returns equity risk premiums target asset allocations the effects of active plan management the impact of periodic plan asset rebalancing and historical performance we also consider the guidance from our investment advisors in making a final determination of our expected rate of return on assets 

for measurement of 2020 net periodic benefit cost we selected an expected pretax longterm rate of return of 570 and 567 for our pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets respectively 

we estimate the assumed health care cost trend rate which is used in determining our other postretirement benefit net expense based upon our actual health care cost experience the effects of recently enacted legislation thirdparty actuarial surveys and general economic conditions 

we use the society of actuaries’ most recently published mortality data in developing a best estimate of mortality as part of the calculation of the pension and other postretirement benefit obligations 

item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

n i s ource i nc  

the following tables illustrate the effects of changes in these actuarial assumptions while holding all other assumptions constant 



1 before labor capitalization and regulatory deferrals 

in january 2017 we changed the method used to estimate the service and interest components of net periodic benefit cost for pension and other postretirement benefits this change compared to the previous method resulted in a decrease in the actuariallydetermined service and interest cost components historically we estimated service and interest cost utilizing a single weightedaverage discount rate derived from the yield curve used to measure the benefit obligation at the beginning of the period for fiscal 2017 and beyond we now utilize a full yield curve approach to estimate these components by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows for further discussion of our pension and other postretirement benefits see note 11  “pension and other postretirement benefits” in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

goodwill and intangible assets we have seven goodwill reporting units comprised of the seven state operating companies within the gas distribution operations reportable segment our goodwill assets at december 31 2019 were 1486 million  most of which resulted from the acquisition of columbia on november 1 2000 

as required by gaap we test for impairment of goodwill on an annual basis and on an interim basis when events or circumstances indicate that a potential impairment may exist our annual goodwill test takes place in the second quarter of each year and was performed on may 1 2019 a qualitative step 0 test was completed on may 1 2019 for all reporting units other than our columbia of massachusetts reporting unit in the step 0 analysis we assessed various assumptions events and circumstances that would have affected the estimated fair value of the applicable reporting units as compared to their baseline may 1 2016 “step 1” fair value measurement the results of this assessment indicated that it is not more likely than not that these reporting units fair values are less than their reporting unit carrying values therefore no “step 1” analysis was required 

the results of our columbia of massachusetts reporting unit were negatively impacted by the greater lawrence incident see note 19 c legal proceedings in the notes to consolidated financial statements as a result we completed a quantitative step 1 analysis for the may 1 2019 goodwill analysis for this reporting unit consistent with our historical impairment testing of goodwill fair value of this reporting unit was determined based on a weighting of income and market approaches these approaches require significant judgments including appropriate longterm growth rates and discount rates for the income approach and appropriate multiples of earnings for peer companies and control premiums for the market approach the discount rates were derived using peer company data compiled with the assistance of a third party valuation services firm the discount rates used are subject to change based on changes in tax rates at both the state and federal level debt and equity ratios at each reporting unit and general economic conditions the longterm growth rate was derived by evaluating historic growth rates new business and investment opportunities beyond the near term horizon the longterm growth rate is subject to change depending on inflationary impacts to

the us economy and the individual business environments in which each reporting unit operates the step 1 analysis performed indicated that the fair value of the columbia of massachusetts reporting unit exceeds its carrying value as a result no impairment charge was recorded as of the may 1 2019 test date 

although our annual impairment test is performed during the second quarter we continue to monitor changes in circumstances that may indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting units is less than the reporting unit carrying value during the fourth quarter of 2019 in connection with the preparation of the yearend financial statements we assessed matters related to columbia of massachusetts while there was no single determinative event or factor the consideration in totality of several factors that developed during the fourth quarter of 2019 led us to conclude that it was more likely than not that the fair value of the columbia of massachusetts reporting unit was below its carrying value these factors included i increased massachusetts dpu regulatory enforcement activity related to columbia of massachusetts during the fourth quarter including a an order imposing work restrictions on columbia of massachusetts impacting columbia of massachusetts infrastructure replacement program b two orders opening public investigations into columbia of massachusetts related to the greater lawrence incident and restoration efforts following the incident and c an order defining the scope of the massachusetts dpus investigation into the preparation and response of columbia of massachusetts related to the incident ii increased uncertainty as to the ability of columbia of massachusetts to execute its growth strategy including utility infrastructure investments and to obtain timely regulatory outcomes with reasonable rates of return iii further damage to columbia of massachusetts reputation as a result of concerns related to service lines abandoned during the restoration work following the greater lawrence incident and the gas release event in lawrence massachusetts on september 27 2019 and iv a potential sale of the massachusetts business see note 19  other commitments and contingencies  c legal proceedings in the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information regarding massachusetts dpu regulatory enforcement activity and note 26 subsequent event in the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information regarding the potential sale of the massachusetts business 

as a result a new impairment analysis was required for our columbia of massachusetts reporting unit this analysis used a weighted average of income and market approaches for calculating fair value the income approach calculated discounted cash flows using updated cash flow projections discount rates and return on equity assumptions the market approach applied a combination of comparable company multiples and comparable transactions and used updated cash flow projections while certain assumptions such as market multiples remained unchanged in the yearend test our cash flow projections return on equity and rate case timing assumptions were all unfavorably updated at yearend compared to the may 1 2019 test the effects of these unfavorable developments were greater than the favorable change in weighted average cost of capital between the two tests the yearend impairment analysis indicated that the fair value of the columbia of massachusetts reporting unit was below its carrying value as a result we reduced the columbia of massachusetts reporting unit goodwill balance to zero and recognized a goodwill impairment charge totaling 2048 million  which is nondeductible for tax purposes 

our intangible assets apart from goodwill consist of franchise rights franchise rights were identified as part of the purchase price allocations associated with the acquisition in february 1999 of columbia of massachusetts we review our definitelived intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate its fair value might be below its carrying amount 

during the fourth quarter of 2019 in connection with the preparation of the yearend financial statements we assessed the changes in circumstances that occurred during the quarter to determine if it was more likely than not that the fair value of the franchise rights was below its carrying amount these factors were the same fourth quarter circumstances outlined in the goodwill impairment discussion above as a result we performed a yearend impairment test in which we compared the book value of columbia of massachusetts to its undiscounted future cash flow and estimated fair value with this analysis we determined that the fair value of the franchise rights was zero therefore we wrote off the entire franchise rights book value which resulted in an impairment charge totaling 2097 million  see note 6  goodwill and other intangible assets in the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information

nisource inc is an energy holding company under the public utility holding company act of 2005 whose subsidiaries are fully regulated natural gas and electric utility companies serving approximately 40 million customers in seven states nisource is the successor to an indiana corporation organized in 1987 under the name of nipsco industries inc which changed its name to nisource on april 14 1999 

nisource is one of the nation’s largest natural gas distribution companies as measured by number of customers nisource’s principal subsidiaries include nisource gas distribution group inc a natural gas distribution holding company and nipsco a gas and electric company nisource derives substantially all of its revenues and earnings from the operating results of these rateregulated businesses 

on september 13 2018 a series of fires and explosions occurred in lawrence andover and north andover massachusetts related to the delivery of natural gas by columbia of massachusetts referred to herein as the “greater lawrence incident” the greater lawrence incident resulted in one fatality and a number of injuries damaged multiple homes and businesses and caused the temporary evacuation of significant portions of each municipality the massachusetts governor’s office declared a state of emergency authorizing the massachusetts dpu to order another utility company to coordinate the restoration of utility services in lawrence andover and north andover the incident resulted in the interruption of gas for approximately 7500  gas meters the majority of which serve residences and of which approximately 700  serve businesses and the interruption of other utility service more broadly in the area columbia of massachusetts has replaced the cast iron and bare steel gas pipeline system in the affected area and restored service to nearly all of the gas meters refer to note 18 c legal proceedings and e other matters in the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information 

nisource’s reportable segments are gas distribution operations and electric operations the following is a summary of the business for each reporting segment refer to item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and note 22  segments of business in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information for each segment 

gas distribution operations 

our natural gas distribution operations serve approximately 35 million customers in seven states and operate approximately 60000 miles of pipeline located in our service areas described below through our whollyowned subsidiary nisource gas distribution group inc we own six distribution subsidiaries that provide natural gas to approximately 26 million residential commercial and industrial customers in ohio pennsylvania virginia kentucky maryland and massachusetts additionally we distribute natural gas to approximately 832000 customers in northern indiana through our whollyowned subsidiary nipsco 

electric operations 

we generate transmit and distribute electricity through our subsidiary nipsco to approximately 472000 customers in 20 counties in the northern part of indiana and engage in wholesale and transmission transactions nipsco owns and operates two coalfired electric generating stations four units at rm schahfer located in wheatfield in and one unit at michigan city located in michigan city in the two operating facilities have a generating capacity of 2080 mw nipsco also owns and operates sugar creek a ccgt plant located in west terre haute in with generating capacity of 571 mw three gasfired generating units located at nipsco’s coalfired electric generating stations with a generating capacity of 186 mw and two hydroelectric generating plants with a generating capacity of 16 mw oakdale located at lake freeman in carroll county in and norway located at lake schahfer in white county in these facilities provide for a total system operating generating capacity of 2853 mw 

in may 2018 nipsco completed the retirement of two coalburning units units 7 and 8 at bailly generating station located in chesterton in these units had a generating capacity of approximately 460 mw refer to note 18e other matters in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on these retirements 

nipsco’s transmission system with voltages from 69000 to 765000 volts consists of 2963 circuit miles nipsco is interconnected with five neighboring electric utilities during the year ended december 31 2018 nipsco generated 694 and purchased 306 of its electric requirements 

nipsco participates in the miso transmission service and wholesale energy market miso is a nonprofit organization created in compliance with ferc regulations to improve the flow of electricity in the regional marketplace and to enhance electric reliability additionally miso is responsible for managing energy markets transmission constraints and the dayahead realtime ftr and ancillary markets nipsco transferred functional control of its electric transmission assets to miso and transmission service for nipsco occurs under the miso open access transmission tariff

business strategy 

we focus our business strategy on our core rateregulated assetbased businesses with most of our operating income generated from the rateregulated businesses our utilities continue to move forward on core infrastructure and environmental investment programs supported by complementary regulatory and customer initiatives across all seven states in which we operate our goal is to develop strategies that benefit all stakeholders as we address changing customer conservation patterns develop more contemporary pricing structures and embark on longterm investment programs these strategies are intended to improve reliability and safety enhance customer services and reduce emissions while generating sustainable returns 

in its 2018 integrated resource plan submission to the iurc nipsco laid out a plan to retire the rm schahfer generating station units 14 15 17 and 18 by 2023 and michigan city generating station unit 12 by 2028 these units represent 2080 mw of generating capacity equal to 72 of nipsco’s remaining capacity after the retirement of bailly units 7 and 8 in may of 2018 the current replacement plan includes renewable sources of energy including wind solar and battery storage to be obtained through a combination of nipsco ownership and ppas refer to note 18e other matters in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of these plans 

competition and changes in the regulatory environment 

the regulatory frameworks applicable to our operations at both the state and federal levels continue to evolve these changes have had and will continue to have an impact on our operations structure and profitability management continually seeks new ways to be more competitive and profitable in this environment 

the gas distribution operations companies have pursued nontraditional revenue sources within the evolving natural gas marketplace these efforts include the sale of products and services upstream of the companies’ service territory the sale of products and services in the companies’ service territories and gas supply cost incentive mechanisms for service to their core markets the upstream products are made up of transactions that occur between an individual gas distribution operations company and a buyer for the sales of unbundled or rebundled gas supply and capacity the onsystem services are offered by us to customers and include products such as the transportation and balancing of gas on the gas distribution operations company system the incentive mechanisms give the gas distribution operations companies an opportunity to share in the savings created from such situations as gas purchase prices paid below an agreed upon benchmark and their ability to reduce pipeline capacity charges with their customers 

increased efficiency of natural gas appliances and improvements in home building codes and standards has contributed to a longterm trend of declining average use per customer residential usage for the year ended december 31 2018 increased primarily due to colder weather in our operating area compared to the prior year while historically rate design at the distribution level has been structured such that a large portion of cost recovery is based upon throughput rather than in a fixed charge operating costs are largely incurred on a fixed basis and do not fluctuate due to changes in customer usage as a result gas distribution operations have pursued changes in rate design to more effectively match recoveries with costs incurred each of the states in which gas distribution operations operate has different requirements regarding the procedure for establishing changes to rate design columbia of ohio restructured its rate design through a base rate proceeding and has adopted a “decoupled” rate design which more closely links the recovery of fixed costs with fixed charges columbia of massachusetts received regulatory approval of a decoupling mechanism which adjusts revenues to an approved benchmark level through a volumetric adjustment factor columbia of maryland and columbia of virginia have regulatory approval for a revenue normalization adjustment for certain customer classes a decoupling mechanism whereby monthly revenues that exceed or fall short of approved levels are reconciled in subsequent months in a prior base rate proceeding columbia of pennsylvania implemented a pilot residential weather normalization adjustment columbia of maryland columbia of virginia and columbia of kentucky have had approval for a weather normalization adjustment for many years in a prior base rate proceeding nipsco implemented a higher fixed customer charge for residential and small customer classes moving toward full straight fixed variable rate design 

natural gas competition  open access to natural gas supplies over interstate pipelines and the deregulation of the commodity price of gas has led to tremendous change in the energy markets ldc customers and marketers can purchase gas directly from producers and marketers as an open competitive market for gas supplies has emerged this separation or “unbundling” of the transportation and other services offered by pipelines and ldcs allows customers to purchase the commodity independent of services provided by the pipelines and ldcs the ldcs continue to purchase gas and recover the associated costs from their customers our gas distribution operations’ subsidiaries are involved in programs that provide customers the opportunity to purchase their natural gas requirements from third parties and use our gas distribution operations’ subsidiaries for transportation services 

gas distribution operations competes with investorowned municipal and cooperative electric utilities throughout its service areas as well as other regulated and unregulated natural gas intra and interstate pipelines and other alternate fuels such as propane

and fuel oil gas distribution operations continues to be a strong competitor in the energy market as a result of strong customer preference for natural gas competition with providers of electricity has traditionally been the strongest in the residential and commercial markets of kentucky southern ohio central pennsylvania and western virginia due to comparatively low electric rates natural gas competes with fuel oil and propane in the massachusetts market mainly due to the installed base of fuel oil and propanebased heating which has comprised a declining percentage of the overall market over the last few years however fuel oil and propane are more viable in today’s oil market 

electric competition  indiana electric utilities generally have exclusive service areas under indiana regulations and retail electric customers in indiana do not have the ability to choose their electric supplier nipsco faces nonutility competition from other energy sources such as selfgeneration by large industrial customers and other distributed energy sources   

seasonality 

a significant portion of our operations are subject to seasonal fluctuations in sales during the heating season which is primarily from november through march revenues from gas sales are more significant and during the cooling season which is primarily june through september revenues from electric sales are more significant than in other months 

other relevant business information 

our customer base is broadly diversified with no single customer accounting for a significant portion of revenues 

as of december 31 2018 we had 8087 employees of whom 3154 were subject to collective bargaining agreements collective bargaining agreements for 1918 employees are set to expire within one year

 item 1a risk factors 

n i s ource  i nc  

our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties including those described below that could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations cash flows and the trading price of our common stock 

we have substantial indebtedness which could adversely affect our financial condition 

our businesses are capital intensive and we rely significantly on longterm debt to fund a portion of our capital expenditures and repay outstanding debt and on shortterm borrowings to fund a portion of daytoday business operations we had total consolidated indebtedness of 91326 million  outstanding as of december 31 2018  our substantial indebtedness could have important consequences for example it could 

 some of our debt obligations contain financial covenants related to debttocapital ratios and crossdefault provisions our failure to comply with any of these covenants could result in an event of default which if not cured or waived could result in the acceleration of outstanding debt obligations 

a drop in our credit ratings could adversely impact our cash flows results of operation financial condition and liquidity 

the availability and cost of credit for our businesses may be greatly affected by credit ratings the credit rating agencies periodically review our ratings taking into account factors such as our capital structure earnings profile and in 2018 the impacts of the tcja and the greater lawrence incident in march 2018 moody’s affirmed our senior unsecured rating of baa2 and our commercial paper rating of p2 with stable outlooks moody’s also affirmed nipsco’s baa1 rating and columbia of massachusetts’s baa2 rating with stable outlooks in may 2018 standard  poor’s affirmed our bbb senior unsecured ratings and affirmed our commercial paper rating of a2 but changed the outlook on each rating from stable to negative in september 2018 as a result of potential impacts of the greater lawrence incident in june 2018 fitch affirmed our and nipscos longterm issuer default ratings of bbb and upgraded the commercial paper rating to f2 from f3 with stable outlooks a credit rating is not a recommendation to buy sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization 

we are committed to maintaining investment grade credit ratings however there is no assurance we will be able to do so in the future our credit ratings could be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if in its judgment the circumstances warrant any negative rating action could adversely affect our ability to access capital at rates and on terms that are attractive a negative rating action could also adversely impact our business relationships with suppliers and operating partners who may be less willing to extend credit or offer us similarly favorable terms as secured in the past under such circumstances 

certain of our subsidiaries have agreements that contain “ratings triggers” that require increased collateral in the form of cash a letter of credit or other forms of security for new and existing transactions if the credit ratings of our or certain of our subsidiaries are dropped below investment grade these agreements are primarily for insurance purposes and for the physical purchase or sale of gas or power as of december 31 2018 the collateral requirement that would be required in the event of a downgrade below the ratings trigger levels would amount to approximately 538 million  in addition to agreements with ratings triggers there are other agreements that contain “adequate assurance” or “material adverse change” provisions that could necessitate additional credit support such as letters of credit and cash collateral to transact business 

if our or certain of our subsidiaries credit ratings were downgraded especially below investment grade financing costs and the principal amount of borrowings would likely increase due to the additional risk of our debt and because certain counterparties may require additional credit support as described above such amounts may be material and could adversely affect our cash flows results of operations and financial condition losing investment grade credit ratings may also result in more restrictive covenants

and reduced flexibility on repayment terms in debt issuances lower share price and greater stockholder dilution from common equity issuances in addition to reputational damage within the investment community 

we may not be able to execute our business plan or growth strategy including utility infrastructure investments 

business or regulatory conditions may result in us not being able to execute our business plan or growth strategy including identified planned and other utility infrastructure investments our customer and regulatory initiatives may not achieve planned results utility infrastructure investments may not materialize may cease to be achievable or economically viable and may not be successfully completed natural gas may cease to be viewed as an economically and environmentally attractive fuel certain groups may continue to oppose natural gas delivery and infrastructure investments because of perceived environmental impacts associated with the natural gas supply chain and end use energy conservation energy efficiency distributed generation energy storage policies favoring electric heat over gas heat and other factors may reduce energy demand any of these developments could adversely affect our results of operations and growth prospects 

adverse economic and market conditions or increases in interest rates could materially and adversely affect our results of operations cash flows financial condition and liquidity 

while the national economy is experiencing modest growth we cannot predict how robust future growth will be or whether it will be sustained deteriorating or sluggish economic conditions in our operating jurisdictions could adversely impact our ability to maintain or grow our customer base and collect revenues from customers which could reduce revenue growth and increase operating costs in addition a rising interest rate environment may lead to higher borrowing costs which may adversely impact reported earnings cost of capital and capital holdings rising interest rates and negative market or company events may also result in a decrease in the price of our shares of common stock 

we rely on access to the capital markets to finance our liquidity and longterm capital requirements including expenditures for our utility infrastructure and to comply with future regulatory requirements to the extent not satisfied by the cash flow generated by our operations we have historically relied on longterm debt and on the issuance of equity securities to fund a portion of our capital expenditures and repay outstanding debt and on shortterm borrowings to fund a portion of daytoday business operations successful implementation of our longterm business strategies including capital investment is dependent upon our ability to access the capital and credit markets including the banking and commercial paper markets on competitive terms and rates an economic downturn or uncertainty market turmoil changes in tax policy challenges faced by financial institutions changes in our credit ratings or a change in investor sentiment toward us or the utilities industry generally could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital or refinance debt reduced access to capital markets andor increased borrowing costs could reduce future net income and cash flows refer to note 14  “longterm debt” in the notes to consolidated financial statements for information related to outstanding longterm debt and maturities of that debt 

if any of these risks or uncertainties limit our access to the credit and capital markets or significantly increase our cost of capital it could limit our ability to implement or increase the costs of implementing our business plan which in turn could materially and adversely affect our results of operations cash flows financial condition and liquidity 

capital market performance and other factors may decrease the value of benefit plan assets which then could require significant additional funding and impact earnings 

the performance of the capital markets affects the value of the assets that are held in trust to satisfy future obligations under defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans we have significant obligations in these areas and hold significant assets in these trusts these assets are subject to market fluctuations and may yield uncertain returns which fall below our projected rates of return a decline in the market value of assets may increase the funding requirements of the obligations under the defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans additionally changes in interest rates affect the liabilities under these benefit plans as interest rates decrease the liabilities increase which could potentially increase funding requirements further the funding requirements of the obligations related to these benefits plans may increase due to changes in governmental regulations and participant demographics including increased numbers of retirements or changes in life expectancy assumptions in addition lower asset returns result in increased expenses ultimately significant funding requirements and increased pension or other postretirement benefit plan expense could negatively impact our results of operations and financial position

the majority of our revenues are subject to economic regulation and are exposed to the impact of regulatory rate reviews and proceedings 

most of our revenues are subject to economic regulation at either the federal or state level as such the revenues generated by us are subject to regulatory review by the applicable federal or state authority these rate reviews determine the rates charged to customers and directly impact revenues our financial results are dependent on frequent regulatory proceedings in order to ensure timely recovery of costs in addition to our ongoing regulatory proceedings the recovery of the greater lawrence pipeline replacement capital investment will be addressed in a future regulatory proceeding as discussed in note 18  other commitments and contingencies  e other matters” in the notes to consolidated financial statements the outcomes of these proceedings are uncertain additionally the costs of complying with current and future changes in environmental and federal pipeline safety laws and regulations are expected to be significant and their recovery through rates will also be contingent on regulatory approval 

as a result of efforts to introduce marketbased competition in certain markets where the regulated businesses conduct operations we may compete with independent marketers for customers this competition exposes us to the risk that certain infrastructure investments may not be recoverable and may affect results of our growth strategy and financial position 

failure to adapt to advances in technology and manage the related costs could make us less competitive and negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition 

a key element of our business model is that generating power at central station power plants achieves economies of scale and produces power at a competitive cost we continue to research plan for and implement new technologies that produce power or reduce power consumption these technologies include renewable energy distributed generation energy storage and energy efficiency advances in technology and changes in laws or regulations are reducing the cost of these or other alternative methods of producing power to a level that is competitive with that of most central station power electric production or result in smallerscale more fuel efficient andor more cost effective distributed generation this could cause power sales to decline and the value of our generating facilities to decline in addition customers are increasingly expecting enhanced communications regarding their electric and natural gas services which in some cases may involve additional investments in technology new technologies may require us to make significant expenditures to remain competitive and may result in the obsolescence of certain of our operating assets 

our future success will depend in part on our ability to anticipate and successfully adapt to technological changes to offer services that meet customer demands and evolving industry standards and to recover all or a significant portion of any unrecovered investment in obsolete assets a failure by us to effectively adapt to changes in technology and manage the related costs could harm our ability to remain competitive in the marketplace for our products services and processes and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition 

the greater lawrence incident has had and may have an additional material adverse impact on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

in connection with the greater lawrence incident we have incurred and will incur various costs and expenses as set forth 

in note 18  other commitments and contingencies  c legal proceedings and   e other matters in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

as more information becomes known including information resulting from the ntsb investigation managements estimates and assumptions regarding the costs and expenses to be incurred and the financial impact of the greater lawrence incident may change a change in management’s estimates or assumptions could result in an adjustment that would have a material impact on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows during the period in which such change occurred 

in addition we are unable to predict the timing and amount of insurance recoveries total expenses related to the incident have exceeded the total amount of liability insurance coverage available under our policies in addition there may be certain types of damages expenses or claimed costs such as fines or penalties that may be excluded under the policies losses for which we are not fully insured or that are not covered by insurance at all could materially adversely affect our results of operations cash flows and financial position 

we may also incur additional costs associated with the greater lawrence incident beyond the amount currently anticipated in connection with investigations by regulators including the ntsb and massachusetts dpu as well as civil litigations further state or federal legislation may be enacted that would require us to incur additional costs by mandating various changes including changes to our operating practice standards for natural gas distribution operations and safety if we are unable to recover the capital cost of the gas pipeline replacement in the impacted area or we incur a material amount of other costs that we are unable to recover through rates or offset through operational or other cost savings our

further if it is determined that we did not comply with applicable statutes regulations rules tariffs or orders in connection with the greater lawrence incident or in connection with the operations or maintenance of our natural gas system and we are ordered to pay a material amount in customer refunds penalties or other amounts our financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

our gas distribution activities as well as generation transmission and distribution of electricity involve a variety of inherent hazards and operating risks 

our gas distribution activities as well as generation transmission and distribution of electricity involve a variety of inherent hazards and operating risks including but not limited to gas leaks and overpressurization downed power lines damage to our infrastructure by third parties outages environmental spills mechanical problems and other incidents which could cause substantial financial losses as demonstrated in part by the greater lawrence incident in addition these hazards and risks have resulted and may in the future result in serious injury or loss of life to employees andor the general public significant damage to property environmental pollution impairment of our operations adverse regulatory rulings and reputational harm which in turn could lead to substantial losses for us the location of pipeline facilities or generation transmission substation and distribution facilities near populated areas including residential areas commercial business centers and industrial sites could increase the level of damages resulting from such incidents as with the greater lawrence incident certain incidents have subjected and may in the future subject us to litigation or administrative or other legal proceedings from time to time both civil and criminal which could result in substantial monetary judgments fines or penalties against us be resolved on unfavorable terms and require us to incur significant operational expenses the occurrence of incidents has in certain instances adversely affected and could in the future adversely affect our reputation cash flows financial position andor results of operations we maintain insurance against some but not all of these risks and losses 

we may be unable to obtain insurance on acceptable terms or at all and the insurance coverage we do obtain may not provide protection against all significant losses 

our ability to obtain insurance as well as the cost and coverage of such insurance are affected by developments affecting our business international national state or local events and the financial condition of insurers insurance coverage may not continue to be available at all or at rates or terms acceptable to us we expect the premiums we pay for our insurance coverage to significantly increase as a result of the greater lawrence incident and market conditions in addition our insurance is not sufficient or effective under all circumstances and against all hazards or liabilities to which we are subject for example total expenses related to the greater lawrence incident have exceeded the total amount of liability coverage available under our policies also certain types of damages expenses or claimed costs such as fines and penalties may be excluded under the policies in addition insurers providing liability insurance to us may raise defenses to coverage under the terms and conditions of the respective insurance policies that could result in a denial of coverage or limit the amount of insurance proceeds available to us any losses for which we are not fully insured or that are not covered by insurance at all could materially adversely affect our results of operations cash flows and financial position for more information regarding our insurance programs in the context of the greater lawrence incident see note 18  other commitments and contingencies  c legal proceedings and   e other matters in the notes to condensed consolidated financial statements 

the outcome of legal and regulatory proceedings investigations inquiries claims and litigation related to our business operations including those related to the greater lawrence incident may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position or liquidity 

we are   involved in legal and regulatory proceedings investigations inquiries claims and litigation in connection with our business operations including the greater lawrence incident the most significant of which are summarized in note 18  “other commitments and contingencies” in the notes to consolidated financial statements our insurance is not expected to cover all costs and expenses we may incur relating to the greater lawrence incident and may not fully cover other incidents that may occur in the future due to the inherent uncertainty of the outcomes of such matters there can be no assurance that the resolution of any particular claim or proceeding would not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position or liquidity if one or more of such matters were decided against us the effects could be material to our results of operations in the period in which we would be required to record or adjust the related liability and could also be material to our cash flows in the periods that we would be required to pay such liability

we are exposed to significant reputational risks which make us vulnerable to a loss of cost recovery increased litigation and negative public perception 

as a utility company we are subject to adverse publicity focused on the reliability of our services the speed with which we are able to respond effectively to electric outages natural gas leaks or events and related accidents and similar interruptions caused by storm damage or other unanticipated events as well as our own or third parties actions or failure to act we are also subject to adverse publicity related to perceived environmental impacts if customers legislators or regulators have or develop a negative opinion of us this could result in less favorable legislative and regulatory outcomes or increased regulatory oversight increased litigation and negative public perception recently we have been subject to adverse publicity as a result of the greater lawrence incident and it is difficult to predict the ultimate impact of this adverse publicity the foregoing may have continuing adverse effects on our business results of operations cash flow and financial condition 

our businesses are regulated under numerous environmental laws the cost of compliance with these laws and changes to or additions to or reinterpretations of the laws could be significant liability from the failure to comply with existing or changed laws could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

our businesses are subject to extensive federal state and local environmental laws and rules that regulate among other things air emissions water usage and discharges and waste products such as coal combustion residuals compliance with these legal obligations require us to make expenditures for installation of pollution control equipment remediation environmental monitoring emissions fees and permits at many of our facilities these expenditures are significant and we expect that they will continue to be significant in the future furthermore if we fail to comply with environmental laws and regulations or are found to have caused damage to the environment or persons even if caused by factors beyond our control that failure or harm may result in the assessment of civil or criminal penalties and damages against us and injunctions to remedy the failure or harm 

existing environmental laws and regulations may be revised and new laws and regulations seeking to change environmental regulation of the energy industry may be adopted or become applicable to us revised or additional laws and regulations may result in significant additional expense and operating restrictions on our facilities or increased compliance costs which may not be fully recoverable from customers through regulated rates and could therefore impact our financial position financial results and cash flow moreover such costs could materially affect the continued economic viability of one or more of our facilities 

an area of significant uncertainty and risk are the laws concerning emission of ghg while we continue to reduce ghg emissions through priority pipeline replacement energy efficiency leak detection and other programs and expect to further reduce ghg emissions through increased use of renewable energy ghg emissions are currently an expected aspect of the electric and natural gas business revised or additional future ghg legislation andor regulation related to the generation of electricity or the extraction production distribution transmission storage and end use of natural gas could materially impact our financial position financial results and cash flows 

even in instances where legal and regulatory requirements are already known or anticipated the original cost estimates for environmental capital projects remediation of past environmental harm or pollution reduction strategies and equipment can differ materially from the amount ultimately expended the actual future expenditures depend on many factors including the nature and extent of impact the method of cleanup the cost of raw materials contractor costs and the availability of cost recovery changes in costs and the ability to recover under regulatory mechanisms could affect our financial position financial results and cash flows 

a significant portion of the gas and electricity we sell is used by residential and commercial customers for heating and air conditioning accordingly fluctuations in weather gas and electricity commodity costs and economic conditions impact demand of our customers and our operating results 

energy sales are sensitive to variations in weather forecasts of energy sales are based on “normal” weather which represents a longterm historical average significant variations from normal weather could have and have had a material impact on energy sales additionally residential usage and to some degree commercial usage is sensitive to fluctuations in commodity costs for gas and electricity whereby usage declines with increased costs thus affecting our financial results lastly residential and commercial customers’ usage is sensitive to economic conditions and factors such as unemployment consumption and consumer confidence therefore prevailing economic conditions affecting the demand of our customers may in turn affect our financial results 

our business operations are subject to economic conditions in certain industries

business operations throughout our service territories have been and may continue to be adversely affected by economic events at the national and local level where it operates in particular sales to large industrial customers such as those in the steel oil refining industrial gas and related industries may be impacted by economic downturns the us manufacturing industry continues to adjust to changing market conditions including international competition increasing costs and fluctuating demand for its products

on october 31 2018 nipsco submitted its 2018 integrated resource plan with the iurc setting forth its short and longterm electric generation plans in an effort to maintain affordability while providing reliable flexible and cleaner sources of power the plan evaluated demandside and supplyside resource alternatives to reliably and costeffectively meet nipsco customers future energy requirements over the ensuing 20 years the preferred option within the integrated resource plan sets forth a schedule to retire rm schahfer generating station units 14 15 17 and 18 by 2023 and michigan city generating station unit 12 by 2028 the current replacement plan includes renewable sources of energy including wind solar and battery storage however there are inherent risks and uncertainties including changes in market conditions regulatory approvals environmental regulations commodity costs and customer expectations which may impede nipsco’s ability to achieve these intended results nipsco’s future success will depend in part on its ability to successfully implement its longterm electric generation plans to offer services that meet customer demands and evolving industry standards and to recover all or a significant portion of any unrecovered investment in obsolete assets nipsco’s electric generation strategy could require significant future capital expenditures operating costs and charges to earnings that may negatively impact our financial position financial results and cash flows 

fluctuations in the price of energy commodities or their related transportation costs or an inability to obtain an adequate reliable and costeffective fuel supply to meet customer demands may have a negative impact on our financial results 

our electric generating fleet is dependent on coal and natural gas for fuel and our gas distribution operations purchase and resell much of the natural gas we deliver to our customers these energy commodities are vulnerable to price fluctuations and fluctuations in associated transportation costs from time to time we have also used hedging in order to offset fluctuations in commodity supply prices we rely on regulatory recovery mechanisms in the various jurisdictions in order to fully recover the commodity costs incurred in providing service however while we have historically been successful in the recovery of costs related to such commodity prices there can be no assurance that such costs will be fully recovered through rates in a timely manner 

in addition we depend on electric transmission lines natural gas pipelines and other transportation facilities owned and operated by third parties to deliver the electricity and natural gas we sell to wholesale markets supply natural gas to our gas storage and electric generation facilities and provide retail energy services to customers if transportation is disrupted or if capacity is inadequate we may be unable to sell and deliver our gas and electric   services to some or all of our customers as a result we may be required to procure additional or alternative electricity andor natural gas supplies at thencurrent market rates which if recovery of related costs is disallowed could have a material adverse effect on our businesses financial condition cash flows results of operations andor prospects 

we are exposed to risk that customers will not remit payment for delivered energy or services and that suppliers or counterparties will not perform under various financial or operating agreements 

our extension of credit is governed by a corporate credit risk policy involves considerable judgment and is based on an evaluation of a customer or counterparty’s financial condition credit history and other factors we monitor our credit risk exposure   by obtaining credit reports and updated financial information for customers and suppliers and by evaluating the financial status of our banking partners and other counterparties by reference to marketbased metrics such as credit default swap pricing levels and to traditional credit ratings provided by the major credit rating agencies adverse economic conditions could result in an increase in defaults by customers suppliers and counterparties 

we have significant goodwill and definitelived intangible assets an impairment of goodwill or definitelived intangible assets could result in a significant charge to earnings and negatively impact our compliance with certain covenants under financing agreements 

in accordance with gaap we test goodwill for impairment at least annually and review our definitelived intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable goodwill also is tested for impairment when factors examples of which include reduced cash flow estimates a sustained decline in stock price or market capitalization below book value indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable we have tested and will continue to monitor the goodwill of columbia of massachusetts for impairment in connection with the greater lawrence incident to date

these tests do not indicate the need for an impairment of the goodwill balance we would be required to record a charge in our financial statements for the period in which any impairment of the goodwill or definitelived intangible assets is determined negatively impacting the results of operations a significant charge could impact the capitalization ratio covenant under certain financing agreements we are subject to a financial covenant under our fiveyear revolving credit facility which requires us to maintain a debt to capitalization ratio that does not exceed 70 a similar covenant in a 2005 private placement note purchase agreement requires us to maintain a debt to capitalization ratio that does not exceed 75 as of december 31 2018 the ratio was 614  

changes in taxation and the ability to quantify such changes could adversely affect our financial results 

we are subject to taxation by the various taxing authorities at the federal state and local levels where we do business legislation or regulation which could affect our tax burden could be enacted by any of these governmental authorities for example the tcja includes numerous provisions that affect businesses including changes to us corporate tax rates businessrelated exclusions and deductions and credits the outcome of regulatory proceedings regarding the extent to which the effect of reduced corporate tax rate will be shared with customers and the time period over which it will be shared could significantly impact future earnings and cash flows separately a challenge by a taxing authority our ability to utilize tax benefits such as carryforwards or tax credits or a deviation from other taxrelated assumptions may cause actual financial results to deviate from previous estimates 

changes in accounting principles may adversely affect our financial results 

future changes in accounting rules and associated changes in regulatory accounting may negatively impact the way we record revenues expenses assets and liabilities these changes in accounting standards may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

aging infrastructure may lead to disruptions in operations and increased capital expenditures and maintenance costs all of which could negatively impact our financial results 

we have risks associated with aging infrastructure assets the age of these assets may result in a need for replacement a higher level of maintenance costs or unscheduled outages despite efforts by us to properly maintain or upgrade these assets through inspection scheduled maintenance and capital investment in addition the nature of the information available on aging infrastructure assets may make inspections maintenance upgrading and replacement of the assets particularly challenging the failure to operate these assets as desired could result in gas leaks and other incidents and in our inability to meet firm service obligations which could adversely impact revenues and could also result in increased capital expenditures and maintenance costs which if not fully recovered from customers could negatively impact our financial results 

the impacts of climate change natural disasters acts of terrorism accidents or other catastrophic events may disrupt operations and reduce the ability to service customers 

a disruption or failure of natural gas distribution systems or within electric generation transmission or distribution systems in the event of a major hurricane tornado terrorist attack accident or other catastrophic event could cause delays in completing sales providing services or performing other critical functions we have experienced disruptions in the past from hurricanes and tornadoes and other events of this nature the occurrence of such events could adversely affect our financial position and results of operations in accordance with customary industry practice we maintain insurance against some but not all of these risks and losses there is also a concern that climate change may exacerbate the risks to physical infrastructure such risks include heat stresses to power lines storms that damage infrastructure lake and sea level changes that damage the manner in which services are currently provided droughts or other stresses on water used to supply services and other extreme weather conditions climate change and the costs that may be associated with its impacts have the potential to affect our business in many ways including increasing the costs we incur in providing our products and services impacting the demand for and consumption of our products and services due to change in both costs and weather patterns and affecting the economic health of the regions in which we operate

a cyberattack on any of our or certain thirdparty computer systems upon which we rely may adversely affect our ability to operate 

we are reliant on technology to run our business which is dependent upon financial and operational computer systems to process critical information necessary to conduct various elements of our business including the generation transmission and distribution of electricity operation of our gas pipeline facilities and the recording and reporting of commercial and financial transactions to regulators investors and other stakeholders in addition to general information and cyber risks that all large corporations face  eg  malware unauthorized access attempts phishing attacks malicious intent by insiders and inadvertent disclosure of sensitive information the utility industry faces evolving cybersecurity risks associated with protecting sensitive and confidential customer information electric grid infrastructure and natural gas infrastructure deployment of new business technologies represents a new and largescale opportunity for attacks on our information systems and confidential customer information as well as on the integrity of the energy grid and the natural gas infrastructure increasing largescale corporate attacks in conjunction with more sophisticated threats continue to challenge power and utility companies any failure of our computer systems or those of our customers suppliers or others with whom we do business could materially disrupt our ability to operate our business and could result in a financial loss and possibly do harm to our reputation 

additionally our information systems experience ongoing often sophisticated cyberattacks by a variety of sources including foreign sources with the apparent aim to breach our cyberdefenses although we attempt to maintain adequate defenses to these attacks and work through industry groups and trade associations to identify common threats and assess our countermeasures a security breach of our information systems could i impact the reliability of our generation transmission and distribution systems and potentially negatively impact our compliance with certain mandatory reliability standards ii subject us to reputational and other harm associated with theft or inappropriate release of certain types of information such as system operating information or information personal or otherwise relating to our customers or employees iii impact our ability to manage our businesses andor iv subject us to legal and regulatory proceedings and claims from third parties in addition to remediation costs any of which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our businesses cash flows financial condition results of operations andor prospects 

our capital projects and programs subject us to construction risks and natural gas costs and supply risks and require numerous permits approvals and certificates from various governmental agencies 

our business requires substantial capital expenditures for investments in among other things capital improvements to our electric generating facilities electric and natural gas distribution infrastructure natural gas storage and other projects including projects for environmental compliance we are engaged in intrastate natural gas pipeline modernization programs to maintain system integrity and enhance service reliability and flexibility nipsco also is currently engaged in a number of capital projects including environmental improvements to its electric generating stations the construction of new transmission facilities and new projects related to renewable energy as we undertake these projects and programs we may be unable to complete them on schedule or at the anticipated costs additionally we may construct or purchase some of these projects and programs to capture anticipated future growth in natural gas production which may not materialize and may cause the construction to occur over an extended period of time 

our existing and planned capital projects require numerous permits approvals and certificates from federal state and local governmental agencies if there is a delay in obtaining any required regulatory approvals or if we fail to obtain or maintain any required approvals or to comply with any applicable laws or regulations we may not be able to construct or operate our facilities we may be forced to incur additional costs or we may be unable to recover any or all amounts invested in a project we also may not receive the anticipated increases in revenue and cash flows resulting from such projects and programs until after their completion 

to the extent that delays occur costs become unrecoverable or we otherwise become unable to effectively manage and complete our capital projects our results of operations cash flows and financial condition may be adversely affected 

sustained extreme weather conditions may negatively impact our operations 

we conduct our operations across a wide geographic area subject to varied and potentially extreme weather conditions which may from time to time persist for sustained periods of time despite preventative maintenance efforts persistent weather related stress on our infrastructure may reveal weaknesses in our systems not previously known to us or otherwise present various operational challenges across all business segments further adverse weather may affect our ability to conduct operations in a manner that satisfies customer expectations or contractual obligations including by causing service disruptions

failure to attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce could harm our results of operations 

we operate in an industry that requires many of our employees to possess unique technical skill sets events such as an aging workforce without appropriate replacements the mismatch of skill sets to future needs or the unavailability of contract resources may lead to operating challenges or increased costs these operating challenges include lack of resources loss of knowledge and a lengthy time period associated with skill development in addition current and prospective employees may determine that they do not wish to work for us due to market economic employment and other conditions failure to hire and retain qualified employees including the ability to transfer significant internal historical knowledge and expertise to the new employees may adversely affect our ability to manage and operate our business if we are unable to successfully attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce safety service reliability customer satisfaction and our results of operations could be adversely affected 

some of our employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements our collective bargaining agreements are generally negotiated on an operating company basis any failure to reach an agreement on new labor contracts or to negotiate these labor contracts might result in strikes boycotts or other labor disruptions labor disruptions strikes or significant negotiated wage and benefit increases whether due to union activities employee turnover or otherwise could have a material adverse effect on our businesses results of operations andor cash flows

we are a holding company and conduct our operations primarily through our subsidiaries substantially all of our consolidated assets are held by our subsidiaries accordingly our ability to meet our debt obligations or pay dividends on our common stock and preferred stock is largely dependent upon cash generated by these subsidiaries in the event a major subsidiary is not able to pay dividends or transfer cash flows to us our ability to service our debt obligations or pay dividends could be negatively affected 

the separation may result in significant tax liabilities 

the separation which was completed in july 2015 was conditioned on the receipt by us of a legal opinion to the effect that the distribution of cpg shares to our stockholders is expected to qualify as taxfree under section 355 of the us internal revenue code the internal revenue code even though we have received such an opinion the irs could determine on audit that the distribution is taxable both us and our stockholders could incur significant us federal income tax liabilities if taxing authorities conclude the distribution is taxable 

if we cannot effectively manage new initiatives and organizational changes we will be unable to address the opportunities and challenges presented by our strategy and the business and regulatory environment 

in order to execute on our sustainable growth strategy and enhance our culture of ongoing continuous improvement we must effectively manage the complexity and frequency of new initiatives and organizational changes if we are unable to make decisions quickly assess our opportunities and risks and implement new governance managerial and organizational processes as needed to execute our strategy in this increasingly dynamic and competitive business and regulatory environment our financial condition results of operations and relationships with our business partners regulators customers and stockholders may be negatively impacted

summary of consolidated financial results 

our operations are affected by the cost of sales cost of sales for the gas distribution operations segment is principally comprised of the cost of natural gas used while providing transportation and distribution services to customers cost of sales for the electric operations segment is comprised of the cost of coal related handling costs natural gas purchased for the internal generation of electricity at nipsco and the cost of power purchased from thirdparty generators of electricity 

the majority of the cost of sales are tracked costs that are passed through directly to the customer resulting in an equal and offsetting amount reflected in operating revenues as a result we believe net revenues a nongaap financial measure defined as operating revenues less cost of sales excluding depreciation and amortization provides management and investors a useful measure to analyze profitability the presentation of net revenues herein is intended to provide supplemental information for investors regarding operating performance net revenues do not intend to represent operating income the most comparable gaap measure as an indicator of operating performance and is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies

for the years ended december 31 2018  2017  and 2016  operating income and a reconciliation of net revenues to the most directly comparable gaap measure operating income was as follows 





on a consolidated basis we reported a loss to common shareholders of 656 million  or 018  per basic share for the twelve months ended december 31 2018  compared to net income available to common shareholders of 1285 million  or 039  per basic share for the same period in 2017  the decrease in net income during 2018 was primarily due to expenses related to the greater lawrence incident restoration dilution resulting from preferred stock dividend commitments and other changes in operating income as discussed below partially offset by the effects of implementing the tcja and higher losses on early extinguishment of longterm debt expenses in 2017 

operating income 

for the twelve months ended december 31 2018  we reported operating income of 1247 million  compared to 9212 million  for the same period in 2017  the decreased operating income was primarily due to increased operation and maintenance expenses related to the greater lawrence incident decreased net revenues resulting from tcja impacts on revenue and increased depreciation due to capital expenditures placed in service these increases were partially offset by higher rates from infrastructure replacement programs and baserate proceedings decreased outside service costs and employee and administrative expenses as well as net favorable effects of yearoveryear weather variations which increased revenue in 2018 

other deductions net 

other deductions net reduced income by 3553 million  in 2018  compared to a reduction in income of 4782 million  in 2017  this change is primarily due to lower losses on early extinguishment of longterm debt in 2018 of 660 million an interest rate swap settlement gain in 2018 of 462 million  and higher actuarial investment returns resulting from pension contributions made in 2017 these favorable variances were partially offset by charitable contributions of 207 million in 2018 related to the greater lawrence incident

income taxes 

on december 22 2017 the president signed into law the tcja which among other things enacted significant changes to the internal revenue code as amended including a reduction in the maximum us federal corporate income tax rate from 35 to 21 and certain other provisions related specifically to the public utility industry including the continuation of certain interest expense deductibility and excluding 100 expensing of capital investments these changes are effective january 1 2018 gaap requires the effect of a change in tax law to be recorded in the period of enactment as a result in december 2017 nisource recorded a 1611 million net increase in tax expense related primarily to the remeasurement of deferred tax assets for nol carryforwards 

the decrease in income tax expense from 2017 to 2018 is primarily attributable to the decrease in the federal corporate income tax rate trueups to tax expense in 2018 to reflect regulatory outcomes associated with excess deferred income taxes the effect of amortizing the regulatory liability associated with excess deferred income taxes and lower pretax income resulting from expenses incurred for the greater lawrence incident 

refer to “liquidity and capital resources” below and note 10  income taxes in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on income taxes and the change in the effective tax rate 

capital investment 

in 2018  we invested approximately 18 billion  in cash capital expenditures across the gas and electric utilities these expenditures were primarily aimed at furthering the safety and reliability of our gas distribution system the greater lawrence incident pipeline replacement construction of new electric transmission assets and maintaining our existing electric generation fleet 

we continue to execute on an estimated 30 billion in total projected longterm regulated utility infrastructure investments and expect to invest approximately 16  to 17 billion  in capital during 2019  to continue to modernize and improve our system across all seven states of our operating area 

liquidity 

 as discussed in further detail below in “liquidity and capital resources” the tcja has and will continue to have an unfavorable impact on our liquidity additionally expenses paid for the greater lawrence incident are expected to have a short term negative impact on liquidity as recoveries from insurance lag behind our cash outlay liquidity will also be negatively impacted to the extent certain costs associated with the greater lawrence incident are not recovered from insurance through income generated from operating activities amounts available under our shortterm revolving credit facility commercial paper program accounts receivable securitization facilities longterm debt agreements and our ability to access the capital markets we believe there is adequate capital available to fund our operating activities and capital expenditures and the effects of the greater lawrence incident in 2019  and beyond at december 31 2018  and 2017  we had approximately 9746 million  and 9989 million  respectively of net liquidity available consisting of cash and available capacity under credit facilities 

these factors and other impacts to the financial results are discussed in more detail within the following discussions of “results and discussion of segment operations” and “liquidity and capital resources”

 weather 

in general we calculate the weatherrelated revenue variance based on changing customer demand driven by weather variance from normal heating degree days our composite heating degree days reported do not directly correlate to the weatherrelated dollar impact on the results of gas distribution operations heating degree days experienced during different times of the year or in different operating locations may have more or less impact on volume and dollars depending on when and where they occur when the detailed results are combined for reporting there may be weatherrelated dollar impacts on operations when there is not an apparent or significant change in our aggregated composite heating degree day comparison 

weather in the gas distribution operations service territories for 2018  was about 1   warmer  than normal and about 13   colder  than 2017  increasing net revenues 375 million for the year ended december 31 2018  compared to 2017  

weather in the gas distribution operations service territories for 2017  was about 12   warmer  than normal and about 4   warmer  than 2016  decreasing net revenues 17 million for the year ended december 31 2017  compared to 2016  

throughput 

total volumes sold and transported for the year ended december 31 2018  were 10536  mmdth compared to 9732  mmdth for 2017  this increase is primarily attributable to colder weather experienced in 2018 compared to 2017 

total volumes sold and transported for the year ended december 31 2017  were 9732  mmdth compared to 9717  mmdth for 2016  

economic conditions 

all of our gas distribution operations companies have stateapproved recovery mechanisms that provide a means for full recovery of prudently incurred gas costs gas costs are treated as passthrough costs and have no impact on the net revenues recorded in the period the gas costs included in revenues are matched with the gas cost expense recorded in the period and the difference is recorded on the consolidated balance sheets as underrecovered or overrecovered gas cost to be included in future customer billings 

certain gas distribution operations companies continue to offer choice opportunities where customers can choose to purchase gas from a thirdparty supplier through regulatory initiatives in their respective jurisdictions these programs serve to further reduce our exposure to gas prices

comparability of line item operating results may be impacted by regulatory and depreciation trackers other than those for cost of sales that allow for the recovery in rates of certain costs therefore increases in these tracked operating expenses are offset by increases in net revenues and have essentially no impact on net income

weather 

in general we calculate the weatherrelated revenue variance based on changing customer demand driven by weather variance from normal heating or cooling degree days our composite heating or cooling degree days reported do not directly correlate to the weatherrelated dollar impact on the results of electric operations heating or cooling degree days experienced during different times of the year may have more or less impact on volume and dollars depending on when they occur when the detailed results are combined for reporting there may be weatherrelated dollar impacts on operations when there is not an apparent or significant change in our aggregated composite heating or cooling degree day comparison 

weather in the electric operations’ territories for 2018  was 46  warmer than normal and 41  warmer than the same period in 2017  increasing net revenues 252 million for the year ended december 31 2018  compared to 2017  

weather in the electric operations’ territories for 2017  was 4  warmer than normal and 15  cooler than the same period in 2016  decreasing net revenues 161 million for the year ended december 31 2017  compared to 2016  

sales 

electric operations sales were 164480  gwh for 2018  a decrease  of 2776  gwh or 17  compared to 2017  this decrease was primarily attributable to higher internal generation from large industrial customers in 2018 partially offset by increased volumes for residential and commercial customers resulting from warmer weather 

electric operations sales were 167256  gwh for 2017  a decrease  of 1056  gwh or 06  compared to 2016  

bp products north america on march 29 2018 wce which is currently owned by bp plc bp and bp products north america which operates the bp refinery filed a petition at the iurc asking that the combined operations of wce and bp be treated as a single premise and the wce generation be dedicated primarily to bp refinery operations beginning in may 2019 as wce has selfcertified as a qualifying facility at ferc bp refinery plans to continue to purchase electric service from nipsco at a reduced demand level beginning may 2019 refer to note 8  regulatory matters in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 

economic conditions 

nipsco has a stateapproved recovery mechanism that provides a means for full recovery of prudently incurred fuel costs fuel costs are treated as passthrough costs and have no impact on the net revenues recorded in the period the fuel costs included in revenues are matched with the fuel cost expense recorded in the period and the difference is recorded on the consolidated balance sheets as underrecovered or overrecovered fuel cost to be included in future customer billings 

nipscos performance remains closely linked to the performance of the steel industry nipsco’s mwh sales to steelrelated industries accounted for approximately 4967 and 545 of the total industrial mwh sales for the years ended december 31 2018  and 2017  respectively 

electric supply 

bailly generating station nipsco completed the retirement of units 7 and 8 at bailly generating station on may 31 2018 these units had a generating capacity of approximately 460 mw the remaining net book value of the retired units is presented in regulatory assets noncurrent on the consolidated balance sheets this balance continues to be amortized at a rate consistent with its inclusion in customer rates the ongoing recovery of our remaining investment in these units will be addressed in nipscos rate case filed on october 31 2018 refer to note 8  regulatory matters and note 18e other matters in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information

nipsco to conclude in its october 2018 integrated resource plan submission that nipsco’s current fleet of coal generation facilities will be retired earlier than previous integrated resource plan’s had indicated 

the integrated resource plan evaluated demandside and supplyside resource alternatives to reliably and cost effectively meet nipsco customers future energy requirements over the ensuing 20 years the preferred option within the integrated resource plan retires rm schahfer generating station units 14 15 17 and 18 by 2023 and michigan city generating station unit 12 by 2028 these units represent 2080 mw of generating capacity equal to 72 of nipsco’s remaining capacity after the retirement of bailly units 7 and 8 in may of 2018

liquidity and capital resources 

greater lawrence incident as discussed in the executive summary and note 18  “other commitments and contingencies” we have recorded losses associated with the greater lawrence incident and have invested capital to replace the entire affected 45mile cast iron and bare steel pipeline system that delivers gas to the impacted area as discussed in the executive summary and note 18  referenced earlier in this paragraph and part i item 1a “risk factors” in this report we may incur additional expenses and liabilities in excess of our recorded liabilities and estimated additional costs associated with the greater lawrence incident the timing and amount of future financing needs arising from the greater lawrence incident if any will depend on the ultimate timing and amount of payments made in connection with the greater lawrence incident and the timing and amount of associated insurance recoveries through income generated from operating activities amounts available under our shortterm revolving credit facility commercial paper program accounts receivable securitization facilities term loan borrowings longterm debt agreements and our ability to access the capital markets we believe there is adequate capital available to fund these expenditures 

operating activities 

net cash from operating activities for the year ended december 31 2018  was 5401 million  a decrease  of 2021 million  from 2017  this decrease was driven by cash spend for the greater lawrence incident in 2018 offset by decreased pension plan contributions as discussed below as well as decreased operation and maintenance expenses excluding expenses related to the greater lawrence incident the decrease in cash from operations was further offset by higher sales due to colder weather during the 2018 winter heating season compared to 2017 and increased rates from infrastructure replacement programs and rate case outcomes 

greater lawrence incident  during 2018 we paid approximately 731 million  in operating cash flow related to the greater lawrence incident refer to note 18 e other matters for further information 

pension and other postretirement plan funding  in 2017 we contributed 2823 million  to our pension plans including a 277 million discretionary contribution made during the third quarter of 2017 and 316 million  to our other postretirement benefit plans 

in 2018 we contributed 29 million  to our pension plans and 210 million  to our other postretirement benefit plans given the current funded status of the pension plans and barring unforeseen market volatility that may negatively impact the valuation of our plan assets we do not believe additional material contributions to our pension plans will be required for the foreseeable future 

income taxes rates for our regulated customers include provisions for the collection of us federal income taxes the reduction in the us federal corporate income tax rate as a result of the tcja has led to a decrease in the amount billed to customers through rates ultimately resulting in lower cash collections from operating activities as discussed in further detail in note 7  regulatory matters in the notes to the consolidated financial statements our regulated subsidiaries are engaged with the relevant state utility commissions to address the impacts of the tcja on future customer rates during 2018 billings to customers decreased approximately 576 million compared to the same period in 2017 as a result of adjustments to certain rates in our kentucky ohio maryland pennsylvania massachusetts and indiana jurisdictions additionally during 2018 we recorded additional tcjarelated regulatory liabilities related to 2018 collections from customers which are being refunded back to customers once new customer rates are approved by our regulators 

in addition we will be required to pass back to customers “excess deferred taxes” which represent amounts collected from customers in the past to cover deferred tax liabilities which as a result of the passage of the tcja are now less than the originally billed amounts approximately 15 billion of excess deferred taxes was recorded to regulatory liabilities noncurrent on the consolidated balance sheets as of december 31 2017 as a result of implementing the tcja the majority of this balance related to temporary booktotax differences on utility property protected by irs normalization rules as modified rates are approved by each of our regulators we expect this portion of the balance will be passed back to customers over the remaining average useful life of the associated property as required by the tcja the pass back period for the remainder of this balance will be determined by our state utility commissions in future proceedings our estimate of the amount and passback period of excess deferred taxes is subject to change pending final review by the utility commissions of the states in which we operate as noted above this pass back of excess deferred taxes has already begun in certain of our jurisdictions as of december 31 2018 we have approximately 14 billion of remaining regulatory liabilities associated with excess deferred taxes see note 8  regulatory matters for additional information 

as of december 31 2018  we had a recorded deferred tax asset of 7596 million  related to a federal nol carryforward of which 5085 million relates to years prior to the implementation of the tcja as a result of being in an nol position we were not

required to make any cash payments for federal income tax purposes during the three years ended december 31 2018  the carryforward periods for pretcja tax benefits expire in various tax years from 2028  to 2037  however we expect to fully utilize the carryforward benefit prior to its expiration per the tcja utilization of nol carryforwards generated after december 31 2017 do not expire but are limited to 80 of current year taxable income accordingly we may be required to make cash payments for federal income taxes in future years despite having nol carryforwards in excess of current taxes payable 

investing activities 

our cash used for investing activities varies year over year primarily as a result of changes in the level of annual capital expenditures the table below reflects capital expenditures and certain other investing activities by segment for 2018  2017  and 2016    



1 zero corporate and other capital expenditures in 2018 driven by the leasing of it assets beginning in q1 2018 versus historical practice of purchasing 

2 amounts differ from those presented on the statements of consolidated cash flows primarily due to the capitalized portion of the corporate incentive plan payout inclusion of capital expenditures included in current liabilities and afudc equity 

for 2018  capital expenditures and certain other investing activities were 18146 million  which was 608 million higher than the 2017  capital program this increased spending is due in part to costs associated with the greater lawrence incident pipeline replacement gas transmission projects environmental investments and system modernization projects 

for 2017  capital expenditures and certain other investing activities were 17538 million  which was 2634 million higher than the 2016  capital program this increased spending is mainly due to electric transmission projects environmental investments and system modernization projects 

for 2019  we project to invest approximately 16  to 17 billion  in our capital program this projected level of spend is consistent with 2018  spend levels and is expected to focus primarily on the continuation of the modernization projects segment growth across the gas distribution operations segment and tdsic spend

debt covenants   we are subject to a financial covenant under our revolving credit facility and term loan agreement which requires us to maintain a debt to capitalization ratio that does not exceed 70  a similar covenant in a 2005 private placement note purchase agreement requires us to maintain a debt to capitalization ratio that does not exceed 75  as of december 31 2018  the ratio was 614  

sale of trade accounts receivables   refer to note 17  “transfers of financial assets” in the notes to consolidated financial statements for information on the sale of trade accounts receivable 

credit ratings   the credit rating agencies periodically review our ratings taking into account factors such as our capital structure and earnings profile the following table includes our and certain of our subsidiaries credit ratings and ratings outlook as of december 31 2018  

a credit rating is not a recommendation to buy sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization 



certain of our subsidiaries have agreements that contain “ratings triggers” that require increased collateral if our credit ratings or the credit ratings of certain of our subsidiaries are below investment grade these agreements are primarily for insurance purposes and for the physical purchase or sale of power as of december 31 2018  the collateral requirement that would be required in the event of a downgrade below the ratings trigger levels would amount to approximately 538 million  in addition to agreements with ratings triggers there are other agreements that contain “adequate assurance” or “material adverse change” provisions that could necessitate additional credit support such as letters of credit and cash collateral to transact business 

equity our authorized capital stock consists of 420000000 shares 001 par value of which 400000000 are common stock and 20000000 are preferred stock as of december 31 2018  372363656  shares of common stock and 420000 shares of preferred stock were outstanding for more information regarding our common and preferred stock see note 12 equity in the notes to consolidated financial statements

contractual obligations     we have certain contractual obligations requiring payments at specified periods the obligations include longterm debt lease obligations energy commodity contracts and obligations for various services including pipeline capacity and outsourcing of it services the total contractual obligations in existence at   december 31 2018  and their maturities were 



1   longterm debt balance excludes unamortized issuance costs and discounts of 685 million   

2   capital lease payments shown above are inclusive of interest totaling 1146 million   

3 operating lease balances do not include amounts for fleet leases that can be renewed beyond the initial lease term the company anticipates renewing the leases beyond the initial term but the anticipated payments associated with the renewals do not meet the definition of expected minimum lease payments and therefore are not included above expected payments are 267 million in 2019 224 million in 2020 166 million in 2021 123 million in 2022 93 million in 2023 and 88 million thereafter   

our calculated estimated interest payments for longterm debt is based on the stated coupon and payment dates for 2019  we project that we will be required to make interest payments of approximately 3631 million which includes 3198 million  of interest payments related to our longterm debt outstanding as of december 31 2018  at december 31 2018  we had 19772 million  in shortterm borrowings outstanding 

our expected payments included within “other liabilities” in the table of contractual commitments above contains employer contributions to pension and other postretirement benefits plans expected to be made in 2019  plan contributions beyond 2019  are dependent upon a number of factors including actual returns on plan assets which cannot be reliably estimated at this time in 2019  we expect to make contributions of approximately 30 million  to our pension plans and approximately 206 million  to our postretirement medical and life plans refer to note 11  “pension and other postretirement benefits” in the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information 

we cannot reasonably estimate the settlement amounts or timing of cash flows related to longterm obligations classified as “total other liabilities” on the consolidated balance sheets other than those described above 

we also have obligations associated with income property gross receipts franchise payroll sales and use and various other taxes and expect to make tax payments of approximately 2406 million in 2019  which are not included in the table above 

refer to note 18 a “contractual obligations” in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information

market risk disclosures 

risk is an inherent part of our businesses the extent to which we properly and effectively identify assess monitor and manage each of the various types of risk involved in our businesses is critical to our profitability we seek to identify assess monitor and manage in accordance with defined policies and procedures the following principal market risks that are involved in our businesses commodity price risk interest rate risk and credit risk risk management for us is a multifaceted process with oversight by the risk management committee that requires constant communication judgment and knowledge of specialized products and markets our senior management takes an active role in the risk management process and has developed policies and procedures that require specific administrative and business functions to assist in the identification assessment and control of various risks these may include but are not limited to market operational financial compliance and strategic risk types in recognition of the increasingly varied and complex nature of the energy business our risk management process policies and procedures continue to evolve and are subject to ongoing review and modification 

commodity price risk 

we are exposed to commodity price risk as a result of our subsidiaries’ operations involving natural gas and power to manage this market risk our subsidiaries use derivatives including commodity futures contracts swaps forwards and options we do not participate in speculative energy trading activity 

commodity price risk resulting from derivative activities at our rateregulated subsidiaries is limited since regulations allow recovery of prudently incurred purchased power fuel and gas costs through the ratemaking process including gains or losses on these derivative instruments if states should explore additional regulatory reform these subsidiaries may begin providing services without the benefit of the traditional ratemaking process and may be more exposed to commodity price risk 

our subsidiaries are required to make cash margin deposits with their brokers to cover actual and potential losses in the value of outstanding exchange traded derivative contracts the amount of these deposits some of which is reflected in our restricted cash balance may fluctuate significantly during periods of high volatility in the energy commodity markets 

refer to note 9  risk management activities in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information on our commodity price risk assets and liabilities as of december 31 2018  and 2017  

interest rate risk 

we are exposed to interest rate risk as a result of changes in interest rates on borrowings under our revolving credit agreement commercial paper program term loan borrowings and accounts receivable programs which have interest rates that are indexed to shortterm market interest rates based upon average borrowings and debt obligations subject to fluctuations in shortterm market interest rates an increase or decrease in shortterm interest rates of 100 basis points 1 would have increased or decreased interest expense by 133 million  and 158 million  for 2018  and 2017  respectively we are also exposed to interest rate risk as a result of changes in benchmark rates that can influence the interest rates of future debt issuances 

refer to note 9  risk management activities in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information on our interest rate risk assets and liabilities as of december 31 2018  and 2017    

credit risk 

due to the nature of the industry credit risk is embedded in many of our business activities our extension of credit is governed by a corporate credit risk policy in addition risk management committee guidelines are in place which document management approval levels for credit limits evaluation of creditworthiness and credit risk mitigation efforts exposures to credit risks are monitored by the risk management function which is independent of commercial operations credit risk arises due to the possibility that a customer supplier or counterparty will not be able or willing to fulfill its obligations on a transaction on or before the settlement date for derivativerelated contracts credit risk arises when counterparties are obligated to deliver or purchase defined commodity units of gas or power to us at a future date per execution of contractual terms and conditions exposure to credit risk is measured in terms of both current obligations and the market value of forward positions net of any posted collateral such as cash and letters of credit 

we closely monitor the financial status of our banking credit providers we evaluate the financial status of our banking partners through the use of marketbased metrics such as credit default swap pricing levels and also through traditional credit ratings provided by major credit rating agencies

other information 

critical accounting policies 

we apply certain accounting policies based on the accounting requirements discussed below that have had and may continue to have significant impacts on our operations and consolidated financial statements 

basis of accounting for rateregulated subsidiaries  asc topic 980 regulated operations  provides that rateregulated subsidiaries account for and report assets and liabilities consistent with the economic effect of the way in which regulators establish rates if the rates established are designed to recover the costs of providing the regulated service and if the competitive environment makes it probable that such rates can be charged and collected certain expenses and credits subject to utility regulation or rate determination normally reflected in income are deferred on the consolidated balance sheets and are recognized in income as the related amounts are included in service rates and recovered from or refunded to customers the total amounts of regulatory assets and liabilities reflected on the consolidated balance sheets were 22375 million  and 26600 million  at december 31 2018  and 18012 million  and 27956 million  at december 31 2017  respectively for additional information refer to note 8  “regulatory matters” in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

in the event that regulation significantly changes the opportunity for us to recover our costs in the future all or a portion of our regulated operations may no longer meet the criteria for the application of asc topic 980 regulated operations  in such event a writedown of all or a portion of our existing regulatory assets and liabilities could result if transition cost recovery is approved by the appropriate regulatory bodies that would meet the requirements under gaap for continued accounting as regulatory assets and liabilities during such recovery period the regulatory assets and liabilities would be reported at the recoverable amounts if we were unable to continue to apply the provisions of asc topic 980 regulated operations  we would be required to apply the provisions of asc topic 98020 discontinuation of rateregulated accounting  in management’s opinion our regulated subsidiaries will be subject to asc topic 980 regulated operations  for the foreseeable future 

certain of the regulatory assets reflected on our consolidated balance sheets require specific regulatory action in order to be included in future service rates although recovery of these amounts is not guaranteed we believe that these costs meet the requirements for deferral as regulatory assets regulatory assets requiring specific regulatory action amounted to 3204 million  at december 31 2018  if we determine that the amounts included as regulatory assets were not recoverable a charge to income would immediately be required to the extent of the unrecoverable amounts 

the passage of the tcja into law necessitated the remeasurement of our deferred income tax balances to reflect the new us corporate income tax rate of 21 for our regulated entities substantially all of the impact of this remeasurement was recorded to a regulatory asset or regulatory liability as appropriate until such time that we receive final regulatory orders prescribing the required accounting treatment and related impact on future customer rates for additional information refer to note 10  income taxes in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

as discussed in note 18e other matters  greater lawrence pipeline replacement we incurred approximately 167 million  of capital spend for pipeline replacement in the affected communities during 2018 we estimate this replacement work will cost between 220 million  and 230 million  in total columbia of massachusetts has provided notice to its property insurer of the greater lawrence incident and discussions around the claim and recovery have commenced the recovery of any capital investment not reimbursed through insurance will be addressed in a future regulatory proceeding the outcome of such a proceeding is uncertain in accordance with asc 980360 if it becomes probable that a portion of the pipeline replacement cost will not be recoverable through customer rates and an amount can be reasonably estimated we will reduce our regulated plant balance for the amount of the probable disallowance and record an associated charge to earnings this could result in a material adverse effect to our financial condition results of operations and cash flows additionally if a rate order is received allowing recovery of the investment with no or reduced return on investment a loss on disallowance may be required 

pension and postretirement benefits  we have defined benefit plans for both pension and other postretirement benefits the calculation of the net obligations and annual expense related to the plans requires a significant degree of judgment regarding the discount rates to be used in bringing the liabilities to present value expected longterm rates of return on plan assets health care trend rates and mortality rates among other assumptions due to the size of the plans and the longterm nature of the associated liabilities changes in the assumptions used in the actuarial estimates could have material impacts on the measurement of the net obligations and annual expense recognition differences between actuarial assumptions and actual plan results are deferred into aoci or a regulatory balance sheet account depending on the jurisdiction of our entity these deferred gains or losses are then amortized into the income statement when the accumulated differences exceed 10 of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or the fair value of plan assets known in gaap as the “corridor” method or when settlement accounting is triggered

the discount rates expected longterm rates of return on plan assets health care cost trend rates and mortality rates are critical assumptions methods used to develop these assumptions are described below while a third party actuarial firm assists with the development of many of these assumptions we are ultimately responsible for selecting the final assumptions 

the discount rate is utilized principally in calculating the actuarial present value of pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit plan costs our discount rates for both pension and other postretirement benefits are determined using spot rates along an aarated above median yield curve with cash flows matching the expected duration of benefit payments to be made to plan participants 

the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets is a component utilized in calculating annual pension and other postretirement benefit plan costs we estimate the expected return on plan assets by evaluating expected bond returns equity risk premiums target asset allocations the effects of active plan management the impact of periodic plan asset rebalancing and historical performance we also consider the guidance from our investment advisors in making a final determination of our expected rate of return on assets 

for measurement of 2019 net periodic benefit cost we selected an expected pretax longterm rate of return of 610 and 580 for our pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets respectively 

we estimate the assumed health care cost trend rate which is used in determining our other postretirement benefit net expense based upon our actual health care cost experience the effects of recently enacted legislation thirdparty actuarial surveys and general economic conditions 

we use the society of actuaries’ most recently published mortality data in developing a best estimate of mortality as part of the calculation of the pension and other postretirement benefit obligations 

the following tables illustrate the effects of changes in these actuarial assumptions while holding all other assumptions constant

item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

n i s ource  i nc  

in january 2017 we changed the method used to estimate the service and interest components of net periodic benefit cost for pension and other postretirement benefits this change compared to the previous method resulted in a decrease in the actuariallydetermined service and interest cost components historically we estimated service and interest cost utilizing a single weightedaverage discount rate derived from the yield curve used to measure the benefit obligation at the beginning of the period for fiscal 2017 and beyond we now utilize a full yield curve approach to estimate these components by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows for further discussion of our pension and other postretirement benefits see note 11  “pension and other postretirement benefits” in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

goodwill  we have seven goodwill reporting units comprised of the seven state operating companies within the gas distribution operations reportable segment our goodwill assets at december 31 2018  were 16907 million  most of which resulted from the acquisition of columbia on november 1 2000 

as required by gaap we test for impairment of goodwill on an annual basis and on an interim basis when events or circumstances indicate that a potential impairment may exist our annual goodwill test takes place in the second quarter of each year and was most recently finalized as of may 1 2018 in the third quarter of 2018 we determined the greater lawrence incident represented a triggering event that required an impairment analysis of goodwill the incident specifically impacts our columbia of massachusetts reporting unit the quantitative impairment analysis as of september 30 2018 determined the fair value of columbia of massachusetts reporting unit continued to exceed its carrying value for additional information refer to note 6 goodwill and other intangible assets in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

we completed a quantitative step 1 fair value measurement of our reporting units during the may 1 2016 goodwill test consistent with our historical impairment testing of goodwill fair value of the reporting units was determined based on a weighting of income and market approaches these approaches require significant judgments including appropriate longterm growth rates and discount rates for the income approach and appropriate multiples of earnings for peer companies and control premiums for the market approach a qualitative step 0 test was completed on may 1 2018 we assessed various assumptions events and circumstances that would have affected the estimated fair value of the reporting units in our baseline may 1 2016 test the results of this assessment indicated that it is not more likely than not that its reporting unit fair values are less than the reporting unit carrying values and no impairments are necessary 

the discount rates were derived using peer company data compiled with the assistance of a third party valuation services firm the discount rates used are subject to change based on changes in tax rates at both the state and federal level debt and equity ratios at each reporting unit and general economic conditions 

the longterm growth rate was derived by evaluating historic growth rates new business and investment opportunities beyond the near term horizon the longterm growth rate is subject to change depending on inflationary impacts to the us economy and the individual business environments in which each reporting unit operates

nisource inc is an energy holding company under the public utility holding company act of 2005 whose subsidiaries are fully regulated natural gas and electric utility companies serving approximately 39 million customers in seven states nisource is the successor to an indiana corporation organized in 1987 under the name of nipsco industries inc which changed its name to nisource on april 14 1999 

nisource is one of the nation’s largest natural gas distribution companies as measured by number of customers nisource’s principal subsidiaries include nisource gas distribution group inc a natural gas distribution holding company and nipsco a gas and electric company nisource derives substantially all of its revenues and earnings from the operating results of these rateregulated businesses 

on july 1 2015 nisource completed the separation of cpg from nisource cpgs operations consisted of all of nisources columbia pipeline group operations segment prior to the separation following the separation nisource retained no ownership interest in cpg 

nisource’s reportable segments are gas distribution operations and electric operations the following is a summary of the business for each reporting segment refer to item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and note 22  segments of business in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information for each segment 

gas distribution operations 

nisource’s natural gas distribution operations serve approximately 35 million customers in seven states and operate approximately 60000 miles of pipeline located in our service areas described below through its whollyowned subsidiary nisource gas distribution group inc nisource owns six distribution subsidiaries that provide natural gas to approximately 26 million residential commercial and industrial customers in ohio pennsylvania virginia kentucky maryland and massachusetts additionally nisource also distributes natural gas to approximately 830000 customers in northern indiana through its whollyowned subsidiary nipsco 

electric operations 

nisource generates transmits and distributes electricity through its subsidiary nipsco to approximately 469000 customers in 20 counties in the northern part of indiana and engages in wholesale and transmission transactions nipsco owns and operates three coalfired electric generating stations four units at rm schahfer located in wheatfield in two units at bailly located in chesterton in and one unit at michigan city located in michigan city in the three operating facilities have a net capability of 2540 mw nipsco also owns and operates sugar creek a ccgt plant located in west terre haute in with net capability of 535 mw three gasfired generating units located at nipsco’s coalfired electric generating stations with a net capability of 196 mw and two hydroelectric generating plants with a net capability of 10 mw oakdale located at lake freeman in carroll county in and norway located at lake schahfer in white county in these facilities provide for a total system operating net capability of 3281 mw 

refer to note 18 other commitments and contingencies and note 25 subsequent event in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on nipscos longterm generation strategy 

nipsco’s transmission system with voltages from 69000 to 345000 volts consists of 2843 circuit miles nipsco is interconnected with five neighboring electric utilities during the year ended december 31 2017 nipsco generated 652 and purchased 348 of its electric requirements 

nipsco participates in the miso transmission service and wholesale energy market the miso is a nonprofit organization created in compliance with ferc regulations to improve the flow of electricity in the regional marketplace and to enhance electric reliability additionally the miso is responsible for managing energy markets transmission constraints and the dayahead realtime ftr and ancillary markets nipsco transferred functional control of its electric transmission assets to the miso and transmission service for nipsco occurs under the miso open access transmission tariff 

business strategy

competition and changes in the regulatory environment 

the regulatory frameworks applicable to nisource’s operations at both the state and federal levels continue to evolve these changes have had and will continue to have an impact on nisource’s operations structure and profitability management continually seeks new ways to be more competitive and profitable in this environment 

the gas distribution operations companies have pursued nontraditional revenue sources within the evolving natural gas marketplace these efforts include the sale of products and services upstream of the companies’ service territory the sale of products and services in the companies’ service territories and gas supply cost incentive mechanisms for service to their core markets the upstream products are made up of transactions that occur between an individual gas distribution operations company and a buyer for the sales of unbundled or rebundled gas supply and capacity the onsystem services are offered by nisource to customers and include products such as the transportation and balancing of gas on the gas distribution operations company system the incentive mechanisms give the gas distribution operations companies an opportunity to share in the savings created from such situations as gas purchase prices paid below an agreed upon benchmark and their ability to reduce pipeline capacity charges with their customers 

increased efficiency of natural gas appliances and improvements in home building codes and standards has contributed to a longterm trend of declining average use per customer residential usage for the year ended december 31 2017 decreased primarily due to warmer weather in the companys operating area compared to the prior year while historically rate design at the distribution level has been structured such that a large portion of cost recovery is based upon throughput rather than in a fixed charge operating costs are largely incurred on a fixed basis and do not fluctuate due to changes in customer usage as a result gas distribution operations have pursued changes in rate design to more effectively match recoveries with costs incurred each of the states in which gas distribution operations operate has different requirements regarding the procedure for establishing changes to rate design columbia of ohio restructured its rate design through a base rate proceeding and has adopted a “decoupled” rate design which more closely links the recovery of fixed costs with fixed charges columbia of massachusetts received regulatory approval of a decoupling mechanism which adjusts revenues to an approved benchmark level through a volumetric adjustment factor columbia of maryland and columbia of virginia have regulatory approval for a revenue normalization adjustment for certain customer classes a decoupling mechanism whereby monthly revenues that exceed or fall short of approved levels are reconciled in subsequent months in a prior base rate proceeding columbia of pennsylvania implemented a pilot residential weather normalization adjustment columbia of maryland columbia of virginia and columbia of kentucky have had approval for a weather normalization adjustment for many years in a prior base rate proceeding nipsco implemented a higher fixed customer charge for residential and small customer classes moving toward full straight fixed variable rate design 

natural gas competition  open access to natural gas supplies over interstate pipelines and the deregulation of the commodity price of gas has led to tremendous change in the energy markets ldc customers and marketers can purchase gas directly from producers and marketers as an open competitive market for gas supplies has emerged this separation or “unbundling” of the transportation and other services offered by pipelines and ldcs allows customers to purchase the commodity independent of services provided by the pipelines and ldcs the ldcs continue to purchase gas and recover the associated costs from their customers nisource’s gas distribution operations’ subsidiaries are involved in programs that provide customers the opportunity to purchase their natural gas requirements from third parties and use the nisource gas distribution operations’ subsidiaries for transportation services 

gas distribution operations competes with investorowned municipal and cooperative electric utilities throughout its service areas as well as other regulated and unregulated natural gas intra and interstate pipelines and other alternate fuels such as propane and fuel oil gas distribution operations continues to be a strong competitor in the energy market as a result of strong customer preference for natural gas competition with providers of electricity has traditionally been the strongest in the residential and commercial markets of kentucky southern ohio central pennsylvania and western virginia due to comparatively low electric rates natural gas competes with fuel oil and propane in the massachusetts market mainly due to the installed base of fuel oil and propanebased heating which has comprised a declining percentage of the overall market over the last few years however fuel oil and propane are more viable in today’s oil market 

electric competition  indiana electric utilities generally have exclusive service areas under indiana regulations and retail electric customers in indiana do not have the ability to choose their electric supplier nipsco faces nonutility competition from other energy sources such as selfgeneration by large industrial customers and other distributed energy sources   

seasonality 

a significant portion of nisources operations is subject to seasonal fluctuations in sales during the heating season which is primarily from november through march revenues from gas sales are more significant and during the cooling season which is primarily june through september revenues from electric sales are more significant than in other months

 item 1a risk factors 

n i s ource  i nc  

our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties including those described below that could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations cash flows and the trading price of our common stock 

we have substantial indebtedness which could adversely affect our financial condition 

our businesses are capital intensive and we rely significantly on longterm debt to fund a portion of our capital expenditures and repay outstanding debt and on shortterm borrowings to fund a portion of daytoday business operations we had total consolidated indebtedness of 90022 million  outstanding as of december 31 2017  our substantial indebtedness could have important consequences for example it could 

 some of our debt obligations contain financial covenants related to debttocapital ratios and crossdefault provisions our failure to comply with any of these covenants could result in an event of default which if not cured or waived could result in the acceleration of outstanding debt obligations 

a drop in our credit ratings could adversely impact our cash flows results of operation financial condition and liquidity 

the availability and cost of credit for our businesses may be greatly affected by credit ratings the credit rating agencies periodically review our ratings taking into account factors such as our capital structure and earnings profile in 2017 moody’s affirmed the nisource senior unsecured rating of baa2 and its commercial paper rating of p2 with stable outlooks moody’s also affirmed nipsco’s baa1 rating and columbia of massachusetts’s baa2 rating with stable outlooks in 2017 standard  poor’s affirmed the bbb senior unsecured ratings of nisource and its subsidiaries and affirmed nisource’s commercial paper rating of a2 with stable outlooks in 2017 fitch affirmed the longterm issuer default ratings of nisource and nipsco to bbb and affirmed the commercial paper rating of f3 with stable outlooks a credit rating is not a recommendation to buy sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization 

we are committed to maintaining investment grade credit ratings however there is no assurance we will be able to do so in the future our credit ratings could be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if in its judgment the circumstances warrant any negative rating action could adversely affect our ability to access capital at rates and on terms that are attractive a negative rating action could also adversely impact our business relationships with suppliers and operating partners 

certain nisource subsidiaries have agreements that contain “ratings triggers” that require increased collateral in the form of cash a letter of credit or other forms of security for new and existing transactions if the credit ratings of nisource or certain of its subsidiaries are dropped below investment grade these agreements are primarily for insurance purposes and for the physical purchase or sale of gas or power as of december 31 2017 the collateral requirement that would be required in the event of a downgrade below the ratings trigger levels would amount to approximately 461 million  in addition to agreements with ratings triggers there are other agreements that contain “adequate assurance” or “material adverse change” provisions that could necessitate additional credit support such as letters of credit and cash collateral to transact business if the credit ratings of nisource or certain of its subsidiaries were downgraded especially below investment grade financing costs and the principal amount of borrowings would likely increase due to the additional risk of our debt and because certain counterparties may require additional credit support as described above such amounts may be material and could adversely affect our cash flows results of operations and financial condition

we may not be able to execute our business plan or growth strategy including utility infrastructure investments 

business or regulatory conditions may result in us not being able to execute our business plan or growth strategy including identified planned and other utility infrastructure investments our customer and regulatory initiatives may not achieve planned results utility infrastructure investments may not materialize may cease to be achievable or economically viable and may not be successfully completed natural gas may cease to be viewed as an economically and environmentally attractive fuel certain groups may oppose natural gas delivery and infrastructure investments because of perceived environmental impacts associated with the natural gas supply chain and end use energy conservation energy efficiency distributed generation energy storage and other factors may reduce energy demand any of these developments could adversely affect our results of operations and growth prospects 

adverse economic and market conditions or increases in interest rates could materially and adversely affect our results of operations cash flows financial condition and liquidity 

while the national economy is experiencing modest growth we cannot predict how robust future growth will be or whether or not it will be sustained deteriorating or sluggish economic conditions in our operating jurisdictions could adversely impact our ability to maintain or grow our customer base and collect revenues from customers which could reduce revenue growth and increase operating costs 

we rely on access to the capital markets to finance our liquidity and longterm capital requirements including expenditures for our utility infrastructure and to comply with future regulatory requirements to the extent not satisfied by the cash flow generated by our operations we have historically relied on longterm debt to fund a portion of our capital expenditures and repay outstanding debt and on shortterm borrowings to fund a portion of daytoday business operations successful implementation of our longterm business strategies including capital investment is dependent upon our ability to access the capital and credit markets including the banking and commercial paper markets on competitive terms and rates an economic downturn or uncertainty market turmoil changes in tax policy challenges faced by financial institutions changes in our credit ratings or a change in investor sentiment toward us or the utilities industry generally could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital or refinance debt reduced access to capital markets andor increased borrowing costs could reduce future net income and cash flows refer to note 14  “longterm debt” in the notes to consolidated financial statements for information related to outstanding longterm debt and maturities of that debt in addition if any of these risks or uncertainties limit our access to the credit and capital markets or significantly increase our cost of capital it could limit our ability to implement or increase the costs of implementing our business plan which in turn could materially and adversely affect our results of operations cash flows financial condition and liquidity 

capital market performance and other factors may decrease the value of benefit plan assets which then could require significant additional funding and impact earnings 

the performance of the capital markets affects the value of the assets that are held in trust to satisfy future obligations under defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans we have significant obligations in these areas and hold significant assets in these trusts these assets are subject to market fluctuations and may yield uncertain returns which fall below our projected rates of return a decline in the market value of assets may increase the funding requirements of the obligations under the defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans additionally changes in interest rates affect the liabilities under these benefit plans as interest rates decrease the liabilities increase which could potentially increase funding requirements further the funding requirements of the obligations related to these benefits plans may increase due to changes in governmental regulations and participant demographics including increased numbers of retirements or changes in life expectancy assumptions ultimately significant funding requirements and increased pension or other postretirement benefit plan expense could negatively impact our results of operations and financial position 

the majority of our revenues are subject to economic regulation and are exposed to the impact of regulatory rate reviews and proceedings 

most of our revenues are subject to economic regulation at either the federal or state level as such the revenues generated by us are subject to regulatory review by the applicable federal or state authority these rate reviews determine the rates charged to customers and directly impact revenues our financial results are dependent on frequent regulatory proceedings in order to ensure timely recovery of costs additionally the costs of complying with future changes in environmental and federal pipeline safety laws and regulations are expected to be significant and their recovery through rates will be contingent on regulatory approval

as a result of efforts to introduce marketbased competition in certain markets where the regulated businesses conduct operations we may compete with independent marketers for customers this competition exposes us to the risk that certain infrastructure investments may not be recoverable and may affect results of our growth strategy and financial position 

failure to adapt to advances in technology could make us less competitive 

a key element of our business model is that generating power at central station power plants achieves economies of scale and produces power at a competitive cost research and development activities are ongoing for new technologies that produce power or reduce power consumption these technologies include renewable energy distributed generation energy storage and energy efficiency advances in technology or changes in laws or regulations could reduce the cost of these or other alternative methods of producing power to a level that is competitive with that of most central station power electric production or result in smallerscale more fuel efficient andor more cost effective distributed generation this could cause power sales to decline and the value of our generating facilities to decline in addition a failure by us to effectively adapt to changes in technology could harm our ability to remain competitive in the marketplace for our products services and processes 

we are exposed to significant reputational risks which make us vulnerable to a loss of cost recovery increased litigation and negative public perception 

as a utility company we are subject to adverse publicity focused on the reliability of our services the speed with which we are able to respond effectively to electric outages natural gas leaks and similar interruptions caused by storm damage or other unanticipated events as well as our own or third parties actions or failure to act we are also subject to adverse publicity related to perceived environmental impacts if customers legislators or regulators have or develop a negative opinion of us this could result in less favorable legislative and regulatory outcomes or increased regulatory oversight increased litigation and negative public perception the imposition of any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations cash flow and financial condition 

our businesses are regulated under numerous environmental laws the cost of compliance with these laws and changes to or additions to or reinterpretations of the laws could be significant liability from the failure to comply with existing or changed laws could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

our businesses are subject to extensive federal state and local environmental laws and rules that regulate among other things air emissions water usage and discharges and waste products such as coal combustion residuals compliance with these legal obligations require us to make expenditures for installation of pollution control equipment remediation environmental monitoring emissions fees and permits at many of our facilities these expenditures are significant and we expect that they will continue to be significant in the future furthermore if we fail to comply with environmental laws and regulations or are found to have caused damage to the environment or persons even if caused by factors beyond our control that failure or harm may result in the assessment of civil or criminal penalties and damages against us and injunctions to remedy the failure or harm 

existing environmental laws and regulations may be revised and new laws and regulations seeking to change environmental regulation of the energy industry may be adopted or become applicable to us revised or additional laws and regulations may result in significant additional expense and operating restrictions on our facilities or increased compliance costs which may not be fully recoverable from customers through regulated rates and could therefore impact our financial position financial results and cash flow moreover such costs could materially affect the continued economic viability of one or more of our facilities 

an area of significant uncertainty and risk are the laws concerning emission of ghg while we continue to reduce ghg emissions through electric generation with lower carbon intensity priority pipeline replacement energy efficiency leak detection and other programs ghg emissions are an expected aspect of the electric and natural gas business revised or additional future ghg legislation andor regulation related to the generation of electricity or the extraction production distribution and end use of natural gas could materially impact our financial position financial results and cash flows 

even in instances where legal and regulatory requirements are already known or anticipated the original cost estimates for environmental capital projects remediation of past harm or the costs of operating pollution reduction strategies or equipment can differ materially from the amount ultimately expended the actual future expenditures depend on many factors including the nature and extent of impact the method of cleanup the cost of raw materials contractor costs and the availability of cost recovery changes in costs and the ability to recover under regulatory mechanisms could affect our financial position financial results and cash flows

a significant portion of the gas and electricity we sell is used by residential and commercial customers for heating and air conditioning accordingly fluctuations in weather gas and electricity commodity costs and economic conditions impact demand of our customers and our operating results 

energy sales are sensitive to variations in weather forecasts of energy sales are based on “normal” weather which represents a longterm historical average significant variations from normal weather could have and have had a material impact on energy sales additionally residential usage and to some degree commercial usage is sensitive to fluctuations in commodity costs for gas and electricity whereby usage declines with increased costs thus affecting our financial results lastly residential and commercial customers’ usage is sensitive to economic conditions and factors such as unemployment consumption and consumer confidence therefore prevailing economic conditions may affect our financial results 

our business operations are subject to economic conditions in certain industries 

business operations throughout our service territories have been and may continue to be adversely affected by economic events at the national and local level where it operates in particular sales to large industrial customers such as those in the steel oil refining industrial gas and related industries may be impacted by economic downturns the us manufacturing industry continues to adjust to changing market conditions including international competition increasing costs and fluctuating demand for its products 

the implementation of nipsco’s electric generation strategy including the retirement of its coal generation units may not achieve intended results 

on november 1 2016 nipsco submitted its integrated resource plan with the iurc setting forth its short and longterm electric generation plans in an effort to maintain affordability while providing reliable flexible and cleaner sources of power however there are inherent risks and uncertainties including changes in market conditions environmental regulations commodity costs and customer expectations which may impede nipsco’s ability to achieve these intended results in addition the integrated resource plan included an intention to retire the bailly coal generation units units 7 and 8 as soon as mid2018 and two units units 17 and 18 at the rm schahfer generating station by the end of 2023 the miso subsequently approved nipsco’s plan to retire the two bailly coal generation units by may 31 2018 on february 1 2018 nipsco commenced a fourmonth outage of bailly generating station unit 8 to begin work on converting the unit to a synchronous condenser a piece of equipment designed to maintain voltage to ensure continued reliability on the transmission system nipsco expects to complete the retirement of units 7 and 8 by may 31 2018 nipsco’s electric generation strategy could require significant future capital expenditures operating costs and charges to earnings that may negatively impact our financial position financial results and cash flows 

fluctuations in the price of energy commodities or their related transportation costs or an inability to obtain an adequate reliable and costeffective fuel supply to meet customer demands may have a negative impact on our financial results 

our electric generating fleet is dependent on coal and natural gas for fuel and our gas distribution operations purchase and resell much of the natural gas we deliver these energy commodities are vulnerable to price fluctuations and fluctuations in associated transportation costs from time to time we have used hedging in order to offset fluctuations in commodity supply prices we rely on regulatory recovery mechanisms in the various jurisdictions in order to fully recover the commodity costs incurred in operations however while we have historically been successful in recovery of costs related to such commodity prices there can be no assurance that such costs will be fully recovered through rates in a timely manner 

in addition we depend on electric transmission lines natural gas pipelines and other transportation facilities owned and operated by third parties to deliver the electricity and natural gas we sell to wholesale markets supply natural gas to our gas storage and electric generation facilities and provide retail energy services to customers if transportation is disrupted or if capacity is inadequate we may be unable to sell and deliver our gas and electric   services to some or all of our customers as a result we may be required to procure additional or alternative electricity andor natural gas supplies at thencurrent market rates which if disallowed could have a material adverse effect on our businesses financial condition cash flows results of operations andor prospects 

we are exposed to risk that customers will not remit payment for delivered energy or services and that suppliers or counterparties will not perform under various financial or operating agreements 

our extension of credit is governed by a corporate credit risk policy involves considerable judgment and is based on an evaluation of a customer or counterparty’s financial condition credit history and other factors we monitor our credit risk exposure   by obtaining credit reports and updated financial information for customers and suppliers and by evaluating the financial status of our banking partners and other counterparties by reference to marketbased metrics such as credit default swap pricing levels and to traditional

credit ratings provided by the major credit rating agencies adverse economic conditions could result in an increase in defaults by customers suppliers and counterparties 

we have significant goodwill and definitelived intangible assets an impairment of goodwill or definitelived intangible assets could result in a significant charge to earnings and negatively impact our compliance with certain covenants under financing agreements 

in accordance with gaap we test goodwill for impairment at least annually and review our definitelived intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable goodwill also is tested for impairment when factors examples of which include reduced cash flow estimates a sustained decline in stock price or market capitalization below book value indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable we would be required to record a charge in our financial statements for the period in which any impairment of the goodwill or definitelived intangible assets is determined negatively impacting the results of operations a significant charge could impact the capitalization ratio covenant under certain financing agreements we are subject to a financial covenant under our fiveyear revolving credit facility which requires us to maintain a debt to capitalization ratio that does not exceed 70 a similar covenant in a 2005 private placement note purchase agreement requires us to maintain a debt to capitalization ratio that does not exceed 75 as of december 31 2017 the ratio was 676  

changes in taxation and the ability to quantify such changes could adversely affect our financial results 

we are subject to taxation by the various taxing authorities at the federal state and local levels where we do business legislation or regulation which could affect our tax burden could be enacted by any of these governmental authorities for example on december 22 2017 president trump signed into law the tcja which includes numerous provisions that will affect businesses including changes to us corporate tax rates businessrelated exclusions and deductions and credits the outcome of regulatory proceedings regarding the extent to which the effect of reduced corporate tax rate will be shared with customers and the time period over which it will be shared could significantly impact future earnings and cash flows separately a challenge by a taxing authority our ability to utilize tax benefits such as carryforwards or tax credits or a deviation from other taxrelated assumptions may cause actual financial results to deviate from previous estimates 

changes in accounting principles may adversely affect our financial results 

future changes in accounting rules and associated changes in regulatory accounting may negatively impact the way we record revenues expenses assets and liabilities these changes in accounting standards may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

distribution of natural gas and the generation transmission and distribution of electricity involve numerous risks that may result in incidents and other operating risks and costs 

our gas distribution activities as well as generation transmission and distribution of electricity involve a variety of inherent hazards and operating risks such as gas leaks downed power lines other incidents thirdparty damages large scale outages and mechanical problems which could cause substantial financial losses in addition these risks could result in serious injury or loss of life to employees and the general public significant damage to property environmental pollution impairment of our operations adverse regulatory rulings and reputational harm which in turn could lead to substantial losses for us the location of pipeline facilities or generation transmission substation and distribution facilities near populated areas including residential areas commercial business centers and industrial sites could increase the level of damages resulting from such events these activities may subject us to litigation or administrative proceedings from time to time which could result in substantial monetary judgments fines or penalties against us or be resolved on unfavorable terms the occurrence of such events could adversely affect our financial position and results of operations in accordance with customary industry practice we maintain insurance against some but not all of these risks and losses 

aging infrastructure may lead to disruptions in operations and increased capital expenditures and maintenance costs all of which could negatively impact our financial results 

we have risks associated with aging infrastructure assets the age of these assets may result in a need for replacement a higher level of maintenance costs and unscheduled outages despite efforts by us to properly maintain or upgrade these assets through inspection scheduled maintenance and capital investment the failure to operate these assets as desired could result in gas leaks and other incidents and in our inability to meet firm service obligations which could adversely impact revenues and could also result in increased capital expenditures and maintenance costs which if not fully recovered from customers could negatively impact our financial results

the impacts of climate change natural disasters acts of terrorism or other catastrophic events may disrupt operations and reduce the ability to service customers 

a disruption or failure of natural gas distribution systems or within electric generation transmission or distribution systems in the event of a major hurricane tornado terrorist attack or other catastrophic event could cause delays in completing sales providing services or performing other critical functions we have experienced disruptions in the past from hurricanes and tornadoes and other events of this nature the occurrence of such events could adversely affect our financial position and results of operations in accordance with customary industry practice we maintain insurance against some but not all of these risks and losses there is also a concern that climate change may exacerbate the risks to physical infrastructure such risks include heat stresses to power lines storms that damage infrastructure lake and sea level changes that damage the manner in which services are currently provided droughts or other stresses on water used to supply services and other extreme weather conditions climate change and the costs that may be associated with its impacts have the potential to affect our business in many ways including increasing the cost we incur in providing our products and services impacting the demand for and consumption of our products and services due to change in both costs and weather patterns and affecting the economic health of the regions in which we operate

we are reliant on technology to run our business which is dependent upon financial and operational computer systems to process critical information necessary to conduct various elements of our business including the generation transmission and distribution of electricity operation of our gas pipeline facilities and the recording and reporting of commercial and financial transactions to regulators investors and other stakeholders in addition to general information and cyber risks that all large corporations face  eg  malware malicious intent by insiders and inadvertent disclosure of sensitive information the utility industry faces evolving cybersecurity risks associated with protecting sensitive and confidential customer information electric grid infrastructure and natural gas infrastructure increasing largescale corporate attacks in conjunction with more sophisticated threats continue to challenge power and utility companies any failure of our computer systems or those of our customers suppliers or others with whom we do business could materially disrupt our ability to operate our business and could result in a financial loss and possibly do harm to our reputation 

additionally our information systems experience ongoing often sophisticated cyberattacks by a variety of sources with the apparent aim to breach our cyberdefenses although we attempt to maintain adequate defenses to these attacks and works through industry groups and trade associations to identify common threats and assess our countermeasures a security breach of our information systems could i impact the reliability of our generation transmission and distribution systems and potentially negatively impact our compliance with certain mandatory reliability standards ii subject us to harm associated with theft or inappropriate release of certain types of information such as system operating information or information personal or otherwise relating to our customers or employees andor iii impact our ability to manage our businesses 

our capital projects and programs subject us to construction risks and natural gas costs and supply risks 

our business requires substantial capital expenditures for investments in among other things capital improvements to our electric generating facilities electric and natural gas distribution infrastructure natural gas storage and other projects including projects for environmental compliance we are engaged in intrastate natural gas pipeline modernization programs to maintain system integrity and enhance service reliability and flexibility nipsco also is currently engaged in a number of capital projects including environmental improvements to its electric generating stations as well as the construction of new transmission facilities as we undertake these projects and programs we may not be able to complete them on schedule or at the anticipated costs additionally we may construct or purchase some of these projects and programs to capture anticipated future growth in natural gas production which may not materialize and may cause the construction to occur over an extended period of time we also may not receive the anticipated increases in revenue and cash flows resulting from such projects and programs until after their completion to the extent that delays occur costs become unrecoverable or we otherwise become unable to effectively manage and complete our capital projects our results of operations cash flows and financial condition may be adversely affected 

sustained extreme weather conditions may negatively impact our operations 

we conduct our operations across a wide geographic area subject to varied and potentially extreme weather conditions which may from time to time persist for sustained periods of time despite preventative maintenance efforts persistent weather related stress on our infrastructure may reveal weaknesses in our systems not previously known to us or otherwise present various operational challenges across all business segments further adverse weather may affect our ability to conduct operations in a manner that satisfies customer expectations or contractual obligations including by causing service disruptions 

item 1a risk factors 

n i s ource  i nc  

failure to attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce could harm our results of operations 

we operate in an industry that requires many of our employees to possess unique technical skill sets events such as an aging workforce without appropriate replacements the mismatch of skill sets to future needs or the unavailability of contract resources may lead to operating challenges or increased costs these operating challenges include lack of resources loss of knowledge and a lengthy time period associated with skill development in addition current and prospective employees may determine that they do not wish to work for us due to market economic employment and other conditions failure to hire and retain qualified employees including the ability to transfer significant internal historical knowledge and expertise to the new employees may adversely affect our ability to manage and operate our business if we are unable to successfully attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce our results of operations could be adversely affected 

we are a holding company and are dependent on cash generated by our subsidiaries to meet our debt obligations and pay dividends on our common stock 

we are a holding company and conduct our operations primarily through our subsidiaries substantially all of our consolidated assets are held by our subsidiaries accordingly our ability to meet our debt obligations or pay dividends on our common stock is largely dependent upon cash generated by these subsidiaries in the event a major subsidiary is not able to pay dividends or transfer cash flows to us our ability to service our debt obligations or pay dividends could be negatively affected 

the separation may result in significant tax liabilities 

the separation was conditioned on the receipt by us of a legal opinion to the effect that the distribution of cpg shares to our stockholders is expected to qualify as taxfree under section 355 of the us internal revenue code even though we have received such an opinion the irs could determine on audit that the distribution is taxable both nisource and our stockholders could incur significant us federal income tax liabilities if taxing authorities conclude the distribution is taxable 

if we cannot effectively manage new initiatives and organizational changes we will be unable to address the opportunities and challenges presented by our strategy and the business and regulatory environment 

in order to execute on our sustainable growth strategy and enhance our culture of ongoing continuous improvement we must effectively manage the complexity and frequency of new initiatives and organizational changes if we are unable to make decisions quickly assess our opportunities and risks and implement new governance managerial and organizational processes as needed to execute our strategy in this increasingly dynamic and competitive business and regulatory environment our financial condition results of operations and relationships with our business partners regulators customers and shareholders may be negatively impacted 

we outsource certain business functions to thirdparty suppliers and service providers and substandard performance by those third parties could harm our business reputation and results of operations 

utilities rely on extensive networks of business partners and suppliers to support critical enterprise capabilities across their organizations we outsource certain services to third parties in areas including construction services information technology materials fleet environmental operational services and other areas outsourcing of services to third parties could expose us to inferior service quality or substandard deliverables which may result in noncompliance including with applicable legal requirements and industry standards or reputational harm which could negatively impact our results of operations if any difficulties in the operation of these systems were to occur they could adversely affect our results of operations or adversely affect our ability to work with regulators unions customers or employees 

we may be unable to obtain insurance on acceptable terms or at all and the insurance coverage we do obtain may not provide protection against all significant losses 

our ability to obtain insurance as well as the cost and coverage of such insurance could be affected by developments affecting our business international national state or local events and the financial condition of insurers insurance coverage may not continue to be available at all or at rates or terms similar to those presently available to us in addition our insurance may not be sufficient or effective under all circumstances and against all hazards or liabilities to which we may be subject any losses for which we are not fully insured or that are not covered by insurance at all could materially adversely affect our results of operations cash flows and financial position

for the years ended december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  operating income and a reconciliation of net revenues to the most directly comparable gaap measure operating income was as follows 





on a consolidated basis nisource reported income from continuing operations of 1286 million  or 039  per basic share for the twelve months ended december 31 2017  compared to 3281 million  or 102  per basic share for the same period in 2016  the decrease in income from continuing operations during 2017 was due primarily to a charge to tax expense of 1611 million as a result of implementing the provisions of the tcja and a loss on early extinguishment of longterm debt of 1115 million partially offset by increased operating income as discussed below 

operating income 

for the twelve months ended december 31 2017  nisource reported operating income of 9106 million  compared to 8582 million  for the same period in 2016  the higher operating income was primarily due to increased net revenues attributable to new rates from base rate proceedings increased rates from incremental capital spend on electric transmission projects at nipsco and the effects of increased customer growth partially offset by warmer weather which reduced revenue in 2017 compared to 2016 additionally operating expenses increased due to higher outside service costs increased employee and administrative expenses higher depreciation expense increased property and payroll taxes and higher environmental expenses 

other income deductions 

other income deductions in 2017  reduced income 4675 million  compared to a reduction of 3480 million  in 2016  this change is primarily due to a loss on early extinguishment of longterm debt in 2017 

income taxes 

on december 22 2017 the president signed into law the tcja which among other things enacted significant changes to the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended including a reduction in the maximum us federal corporate income tax rate from 35 to 21 and certain other provisions related specifically to the public utility industry including the continuation of certain interest expense deductibility and excluding 100 expensing of capital investments these changes are effective january 1 2018 gaap requires the effect of a change in tax law to be recorded in the period of enactment as a result in december 2017 nisource recorded a 1611 million net increase in tax expense related primarily to the remeasurement of deferred tax assets for nol carryforwards 

the reduction in the statutory us federal corporate income tax rate in 2018 is expected to lead to a decrease in nisource’s annual effective tax rate nisource is still evaluating the full impact of the tcja’s provisions on its future effective tax rate and cannot reasonably estimate its impact at this time

capital investment 

in 2017  nisource invested approximately 17 billion  in cash capital expenditures across its gas and electric utilities these expenditures were primarily aimed at furthering the safety and reliability of the companys gas distribution system construction of new electric transmission assets and maintaining nisource’s existing electric generation fleet nisource continues to execute on an estimated 30 billion in total projected longterm regulated utility infrastructure investments and expects to invest approximately 17 to 18 billion  in capital during 2018  to continue to modernize and improve its system across all seven states 

liquidity 

 as discussed in further detail below in “liquidity and capital resources” the enactment of the tcja will have an unfavorable impact on nisource’s liquidity beginning in 2018 however nisource believes that through income generated from operating activities amounts available under its shortterm revolving credit facility commercial paper program accounts receivable securitization facilities longterm debt agreements and nisource’s ability to access the capital markets there is adequate capital available to fund its operating activities and capital expenditures in 2018  and beyond at december 31 2017  and 2016  nisource had approximately 9989 million  and 6837 million  respectively of net liquidity available consisting of cash and available capacity under credit facilities 

these factors and other impacts to the financial results are discussed in more detail within the following discussions of “results and discussion of segment operations” and “liquidity and capital resources”

weather 

in general nisource calculates the weatherrelated revenue variance based on changing customer demand driven by weather variance from normal heating degree days nisources composite heating degree days reported do not directly correlate to the weatherrelated dollar impact on the results of gas distribution operations heating degree days experienced during different times of the year or in different operating locations may have more or less impact on volume and dollars depending on when and where they occur when the detailed results are combined for reporting there may be weatherrelated dollar impacts on operations when there is not an apparent or significant change in the aggregated nisource composite heating degree day comparison 

weather in the gas distribution operations service territories for 2017  was about 12  warmer than normal and about 4  warmer than 2016  decreasing net revenues 17 million for the year ended december 31 2017  compared to 2016  

weather in the gas distribution operations service territories for 2016  was about 9 warmer than normal and about 6 warmer than 2015  decreasing net revenues 124 million for the year ended december 31 2016  compared to 2015  

throughput 

total volumes sold and transported for the year ended december 31 2017  were 9732  mmdth compared to 9717  mmdth for 2016  

total volumes sold and transported for the year ended december 31 2016  were 9717  mmdth compared to 9887 mmdth for 2015  this decrease is primarily attributable to warmer weather experienced in 2016  compared to 2015  

economic conditions 

all nisource gas distribution operations companies have stateapproved recovery mechanisms that provide a means for full recovery of prudently incurred gas costs as noted above gas costs are treated as passthrough costs and have no impact on the net revenues recorded in the period the gas costs included in revenues are matched with the gas cost expense recorded in the period and the difference is recorded on the consolidated balance sheets as underrecovered or overrecovered gas cost to be included in future customer billings 

at nipsco sales revenues and customer billings are adjusted for amounts related to under and overrecovered purchased gas costs from prior periods per regulatory order these amounts are primarily reflected in the “other” operating revenues statistic provided at the beginning of this segment discussion the adjustments to other operating revenues for the twelve months ended december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  were a revenue decrease of 48 million a revenue increase of 433 million and a revenue decrease of 680 million respectively 

certain gas distribution operations companies continue to offer choice opportunities where customers can choose to purchase gas from a thirdparty supplier through regulatory initiatives in their respective jurisdictions these programs serve to further reduce nisources exposure to gas prices

in general nisource calculates the weatherrelated revenue variance based on changing customer demand driven by weather variance from normal heating or cooling degree days nisources composite heating or cooling degree days reported do not directly correlate to the weatherrelated dollar impact on the results of electric operations heating or cooling degree days experienced during different times of the year may have more or less impact on volume and dollars depending on when they occur when the detailed results are combined for reporting there may be weatherrelated dollar impacts on operations when there is not an apparent or significant change in the aggregated nisource composite heating or cooling degree day comparison 

weather in the electric operations’ territories for the twelve months ended   december 31 2017  was 4  warmer than normal and 15  cooler than the same period in 2016  leading to a decrease in net revenues of approximately 161 million for the twelve months ended   december 31 2017  compared to 2016

nipsco has a stateapproved recovery mechanism that provides a means for full recovery of prudently incurred fuel costs as noted above fuel costs are treated as passthrough costs and have no impact on the net revenues recorded in the period the fuel costs included in revenues are matched with the fuel cost expense recorded in the period and the difference is recorded on the consolidated balance sheets as underrecovered or overrecovered fuel cost to be included in future customer billings 

at nipsco sales revenues and customer billings are adjusted for amounts related to under and overrecovered purchased fuel costs from prior periods per regulatory order these amounts are primarily reflected in the “other” operating revenues statistic provided at the beginning of this segment discussion the adjustments to other operating revenues for the twelve months ended december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  were a revenue decrease of 52 million a revenue increase of 331 million and a revenue decrease of 116 million respectively 

nipscos performance remains closely linked to the performance of the steel industry nipsco’s mwh sales to steelrelated industries accounted for approximately 545 and 523 of the total industrial mwh sales for the years ended december 31 2017  and 2016  respectively 

electric supply 

nipsco 2016 integrated resource plan environmental regulatory and economic factors including low natural gas prices and aging coalfired units have led nipsco to pursue modification of its current electric generation supply mix to include less coalfired generation due to enacted ccr and elg subsequently postponed regulations nipsco would expect to have incurred over 1 billion in operating maintenance environmental and other costs if the current fleet of coalfired generating units were to remain operational 

on november 1 2016 nipsco submitted its 2016 integrated resource plan with the iurc the plan evaluated demandside and supplyside resource alternatives to reliably and cost effectively meet nipsco customers future energy requirements over the ensuing 20 years the 2016 integrated resource plan indicates that the most viable option for customers and nipsco involves the retirement of bailly generating station units 7 and 8 as soon as mid2018 and two units units 17 and 18 at the rm schahfer generating station by the end of 2023 it is projected over the long term that the cost to customers to retire these units at these dates will be lower than maintaining and upgrading them for continuing generation

nisource and nipsco committed to the retirement of the bailly generating station units in connection with the filing of the 2016 integrated resource plan pending approval by the miso in the fourth quarter of 2016 the miso approved nipscos plan to retire the bailly generating station units by may 31 2018 in accordance with asc 980360 the remaining net book value of the bailly generating station units was reclassified from net utility plant to other property at cost less accumulated depreciation on the consolidated balance sheets 

in connection with the misos approval of nipscos planned retirement of the bailly generating station units nisource recorded 221 million of plant retirementrelated charges in the fourth quarter of 2016 these charges were comprised of contract termination charges related to nipscos capital lease with pure air voluntary employee severance benefits and write downs of certain materials and supplies inventory balances these charges are presented within operation and maintenance on the statements of consolidated income 

on february 1 2018 as previously approved by the miso nipsco commenced a fourmonth outage of bailly generating station unit 8 in order to begin work on converting the unit to a synchronous condenser a piece of equipment designed to maintain voltage to ensure continued reliability on the transmission system approximately 15 million  of net book value of unit 8 remained in “net utility plant” as it is expected to remain used and useful upon completion of the synchronous condenser while the remaining net book value of approximately 143 million  was reclassified to “regulatory assets noncurrent” on the consolidated balance sheets these amounts continue to be amortized at a rate consistent with their inclusion in customer rates nipsco expects to complete the retirement of units 7 and 8 by may 31 2018 refer to note 18 e other matters in the notes to consolidated financial statements for information

liquidity and capital resources 

operating activities 

net cash from operating activities from continuing operations for the year ended december 31 2017  was 7421 million  a decrease  of 620 million  from 2016  this decrease was driven by 2823 million of pension plan contributions in 2017 partially offset by a combination of changes in weather gas prices and the related approved rates for recovery which significantly impacted regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities between the two periods as discussed further below 

net cash from operating activities from continuing operations for the year ended december 31 2016  was 8041 million  a decrease of 3593 million  from 2015 this decrease was driven by a combination of changes in weather gas prices and the related approved rates for recovery which significantly impacted regulatory assets regulatory liabilities and working capital between the two periods during 2015 natural gas prices were declining faster than the gas cost adjustments being collected from customers resulting in an associated source of cash from working capital during 2016 these overcollected gas costs from 2015 were returned to customers resulting in a use of working capital 

regulatory assets and liabilities  during the year ended december 31 2016 overcollected gas costs from 2015 were returned to customers resulting in a use of cash in 2017 less cash was required to be returned to customers because the balance of overcollected gas costs from 2016 was smaller than in 2015 

pension and other postretirement plan funding  in 2017 nisource contributed 2823 million  to its pension plans including a 277 million discretionary contribution made during the third quarter of 2017 and 316 million  to its other postretirement benefit plans the return on assets related to the discretionary pension contribution is expected to result in a decrease to net periodic benefit costs beginning in 2018 however due to increasing workforce retirements certain nisource pension plans are expected to trigger settlement accounting annually for the foreseeable future the resulting charges from settlement accounting if realized are expected to partially offset this decrease in periodic benefits costs 

in 2018 nisource expects to make contributions of 29 million to its pension plans and 250 million to its postretirement medical and life plans given the current funded status of the pension plans and barring unforeseen market volatility that may negatively impact the valuation of its plan assets nisource does not believe additional material contributions to its pension plans will be required for the foreseeable future 

income taxes rates for nisource’s regulated customers include provisions for the collection of us federal income taxes the reduction in the us federal corporate income tax rate as a result of the tcja is expected to lead to a decrease in the amount billed to customers through rates ultimately resulting in lower cash collections from operating activities nisource is currently working to estimate the impact of this revenue reduction 

in addition nisource will be required to pass back to customers “excess deferred taxes” which represent amounts collected from customers in the past to cover deferred tax liabilities which as a result of the passage of the tcja are now expected to be less than the originally billed amounts approximately 15 billion of excess deferred taxes related to implementation of the tcja are presented within regulatory liabilities noncurrent on the consolidated balance sheets as of december 31 2017 the majority of this balance relates to temporary booktotax differences on utility property protected by irs normalization rules nisource expects this portion of the balance will be passed back to customers over the remaining average useful life of the associated property the pass back period for the remainder of this balance will be determined by nisources state utility commissions in future proceedings nisource’s estimate of the amount and passback period of excess deferred taxes is subject to change pending final review by the utility commissions of the states in which nisource operates 

as of december 31 2017  nisource has a recorded deferred tax asset of 5085 million  related to a federal nol carryforward as a result of being in an nol position nisource was not required to make any cash payments for federal income tax purposes during the years ended december 31 2017  2016 or 2015 for nisource nols generated before december 31 2017 the nol carryforward expires in 2037 however nisource expects to fully utilize the carryforward benefit prior to its expiration 

per the tcja utilization of nol carryforwards generated after december 31 2017 is limited to 80 of current year taxable income accordingly nisource may be required to make cash payments for federal income taxes in future years despite having nol carryforwards in excess of current taxes payable

investing activities 

nisources cash used for investing activities varies year over year primarily as a result of changes in the level of annual capital expenditures the table below reflects capital expenditures and certain other investing activities by segment for 2017  2016  and 2015    



1  amounts differ from those presented on the statements of consolidated cash flows primarily due to the inclusion of capital expenditures included in current liabilities and afudc equity 

for 2017  capital expenditures and certain other investing activities were 17538 million  which was 2634 million higher than the 2016  capital program this increased spending is mainly due to electric transmission projects environmental investments and system modernization projects 

for 2016  capital expenditures and certain other investing activities were 14904 million  which was 1229 million higher than the 2015 capital program this increased spending is mainly due to modernization projects and segment growth at the gas distribution operations segment 

for 2018  nisource projects to invest approximately 17 to 18 billion in its capital program this projected level of spend is consistent with 2017 spend levels and is expected to focus primarily on the continuation of the modernization projects segment growth across the gas distribution operations segment and tdsic spend

1 represents the lesser of the seasonal limit or maximum borrowings supportable by the underlying receivables 

the change in net available liquidity between 2017  and 2016  was driven by lower utilization of shortterm debt in the current year as a result of cash proceeds from other forms of financing 

debt covenants   nisource is subject to a financial covenant under its revolving credit facility which requires nisource to maintain a debt to capitalization ratio that does not exceed 70  a similar covenant in a 2005 private placement note purchase agreement requires nisource to maintain a debt to capitalization ratio that does not exceed 75  as of december 31 2017  the ratio was 676  

sale of trade accounts receivables   refer to note 17  “transfers of financial assets” in the notes to consolidated financial statements for information on the sale of trade accounts receivable 

credit ratings   the credit rating agencies periodically review the company’s ratings taking into account factors such as its capital structure and earnings profile the following table includes nisources and certain subsidiaries credit ratings and ratings outlook as of december 31 2017  there were no changes to credit ratings or outlooks since december 31 2016 a credit rating is not a recommendation to buy sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization 



certain nisource subsidiaries have agreements that contain “ratings triggers” that require increased collateral if the credit ratings of nisource or certain of its subsidiaries are below investment grade these agreements are primarily for insurance purposes and for the physical purchase or sale of power as of december 31 2017  the collateral requirement that would be required in the event of a downgrade below the ratings trigger levels would amount to approximately 461 million  in addition to agreements with ratings triggers there are other agreements that contain “adequate assurance” or “material adverse change” provisions that could necessitate additional credit support such as letters of credit and cash collateral to transact business

2   capital lease payments shown above are inclusive of interest totaling 919 million   

3 operating lease balances do not include amounts for fleet leases that can be renewed beyond the initial lease term the company anticipates renewing the leases beyond the initial term but the anticipated payments associated with the renewals do not meet the definition of expected minimum lease payments and therefore are not included above expected payments are 293 million in 2018 275 million in 2019 197 million in 2020 139 million in 2021 96 million in 2022 and 74 million thereafter   

nisource calculated estimated interest payments for longterm debt based on the stated coupon and payment dates for 2018  nisource projects that it will be required to make interest payments of approximately 3881 million which includes 3644 million  of interest payments related to its longterm debt outstanding as of december 31 2017  at december 31 2017  nisource had 12057 million  in shortterm borrowings outstanding 

nisource’s expected payments included within “other liabilities” in the table of contractual commitments above contains employer contributions to pension and other postretirement benefits plans expected to be made in 2018  plan contributions beyond 2018  are dependent upon a number of factors including actual returns on plan assets which cannot be reliably estimated at this time in 2018  nisource expects to make contributions of approximately 29 million  to its pension plans and approximately 250 million  to its postretirement medical and life plans refer to note 11  “pension and other postretirement benefits” in the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information 

nisource cannot reasonably estimate the settlement amounts or timing of cash flows related to longterm obligations classified as “total other liabilities” on the consolidated balance sheets other than those described above

market risk disclosures 

risk is an inherent part of nisource’s businesses the extent to which nisource properly and effectively identifies assesses monitors and manages each of the various types of risk involved in its businesses is critical to its profitability nisource seeks to identify assess monitor and manage in accordance with defined policies and procedures the following principal market risks that are involved in nisource’s businesses commodity price risk interest rate risk and credit risk risk management at nisource is a multifaceted process with oversight by the risk management committee that requires constant communication judgment and knowledge of specialized products and markets nisource’s senior management takes an active role in the risk management process and has developed policies and procedures that require specific administrative and business functions to assist in the identification assessment and control of various risks these may include but are not limited to market operational financial compliance and strategic risk types in recognition of the increasingly varied and complex nature of the energy business nisource’s risk management process policies and procedures continue to evolve and are subject to ongoing review and modification   

commodity price risk 

nisource is exposed to commodity price risk as a result of its subsidiaries’ operations involving natural gas and power to manage this market risk nisource’s subsidiaries use derivatives including commodity futures contracts swaps forwards and options nisource does not participate in speculative energy trading activity 

commodity price risk resulting from derivative activities at nisource’s rateregulated subsidiaries is limited since regulations allow recovery of prudently incurred purchased power fuel and gas costs through the ratemaking process including gains or losses on these derivative instruments if states should explore additional regulatory reform these subsidiaries may begin providing services without the benefit of the traditional ratemaking process and may be more exposed to commodity price risk 

nisource subsidiaries are required to make cash margin deposits with their brokers to cover actual and potential losses in the value of outstanding exchange traded derivative contracts the amount of these deposits which are reflected in nisource’s restricted cash balance may fluctuate significantly during periods of high volatility in the energy commodity markets 

refer to note 9  risk management activities in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information on nisources commodity price risk assets and liabilities as of december 31 2017  and 2016  

interest rate risk 

nisource is exposed to interest rate risk as a result of changes in interest rates on borrowings under its revolving credit agreement commercial paper program and accounts receivable programs which have interest rates that are indexed to shortterm market interest rates based upon average borrowings and debt obligations subject to fluctuations in shortterm market interest rates an increase or decrease in shortterm interest rates of 100 basis points 1 would have increased or decreased interest expense by 158 million  and 117 million  for 2017  and 2016  respectively nisource is also exposed to interest rate risk as a result of changes in benchmark rates that can influence the interest rates of future debt issuances nisource and its subsidiaries manage interest rate risk on longterm debt through forward starting interest rate swaps that hedge the interest rate risk related to forecasted issuances 

refer to note 9  risk management activities in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information on nisources interest rate risk assets and liabilities as of december 31 2017  and 2016    

credit risk 

due to the nature of the industry credit risk is embedded in many of nisource’s business activities nisource’s extension of credit is governed by a corporate credit risk policy in addition risk management committee guidelines are in place which document management approval levels for credit limits evaluation of creditworthiness and credit risk mitigation efforts exposures to credit risks are monitored by the risk management function which is independent of commercial operations credit risk arises due to the possibility that a customer supplier or counterparty will not be able or willing to fulfill its obligations on a transaction on or before the settlement date for derivativerelated contracts credit risk arises when counterparties are obligated to deliver or purchase defined commodity units of gas or power to nisource at a future date per execution of contractual terms and conditions exposure to credit risk is measured in terms of both current obligations and the market value of forward positions net of any posted collateral such as cash and letters of credit 

nisource closely monitors the financial status of its banking credit providers nisource evaluates the financial status of its banking partners through the use of marketbased metrics such as credit default swap pricing levels and also through traditional credit ratings provided by major credit rating agencies

other information 

critical accounting policies 

nisource applies certain accounting policies based on the accounting requirements discussed below that have had and may continue to have significant impacts on nisource’s results of operations and consolidated financial statements 

basis of accounting for rateregulated subsidiaries  asc topic 980 regulated operations  provides that rateregulated subsidiaries account for and report assets and liabilities consistent with the economic effect of the way in which regulators establish rates if the rates established are designed to recover the costs of providing the regulated service and if the competitive environment makes it probable that such rates can be charged and collected certain expenses and credits subject to utility regulation or rate determination normally reflected in income are deferred on the consolidated balance sheets and are recognized in income as the related amounts are included in service rates and recovered from or refunded to customers the total amounts of regulatory assets and liabilities reflected on the consolidated balance sheets were 18012 million  and 27956 million  at december 31 2017  and 18854 million  and 13818 million  at december 31 2016  respectively for additional information refer to note 8  “regulatory matters” in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

in the event that regulation significantly changes the opportunity for nisource to recover its costs in the future all or a portion of nisource’s regulated operations may no longer meet the criteria for the application of asc topic 980 regulated operations  in such event a writedown of all or a portion of nisource’s existing regulatory assets and liabilities could result if transition cost recovery is approved by the appropriate regulatory bodies that would meet the requirements under gaap for continued accounting as regulatory assets and liabilities during such recovery period the regulatory assets and liabilities would be reported at the recoverable amounts if unable to continue to apply the provisions of asc topic 980 regulated operations  nisource would be required to apply the provisions of asc topic 98020 discontinuation of rateregulated accounting  in management’s opinion nisource’s regulated subsidiaries will be subject to asc topic 980 regulated operations  for the foreseeable future 

certain of the regulatory assets reflected on nisource’s consolidated balance sheets require specific regulatory action in order to be included in future service rates although recovery of these amounts is not guaranteed nisource believes that these costs meet the requirements for deferral as regulatory assets regulatory assets requiring specific regulatory action amounted to 3984 million  at december 31 2017  if nisource determined that the amounts included as regulatory assets were not recoverable a charge to income would immediately be required to the extent of the unrecoverable amounts 

the passage of the tcja into law necessitated the remeasurement of nisource’s deferred income tax balances to reflect the new us corporate income tax rate of 21 for nisource’s regulated entities substantially all of the impact of this remeasurement was recorded to a regulatory asset or regulatory liability as appropriate until such time that nisource receives final regulatory orders prescribing the required accounting treatment and related impact on future customer rates to the extent final regulatory orders received prescribe accounting treatment different from what is currently reflected in nisource’s financial statements nisource’s results of operations could be impacted 

pension and postretirement benefits  nisource has defined benefit plans for both pension and other postretirement benefits the calculation of the net obligations and annual expense related to the plans requires a significant degree of judgment regarding the discount rates to be used in bringing the liabilities to present value expected longterm rates of return on plan assets health care trend rates and mortality rates among other assumptions due to the size of the plans and the longterm nature of the associated liabilities changes in the assumptions used in the actuarial estimates could have material impacts on the measurement of the net obligations and annual expense recognition differences between actuarial assumptions and actual plan results are deferred into aoci or a regulatory balance sheet account depending on the jurisdiction of the nisource entity these deferred gains or losses are then amortized into the income statement when the accumulated differences exceed 10 of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or the fair value of plan assets known in gaap as the “corridor” method or when settlement accounting is triggered 

the discount rates expected longterm rates of return on plan assets health care cost trend rates and mortality rates are critical assumptions methods used to develop these assumptions are described below while a third party actuarial firm assists with the development of many of these assumptions nisource is ultimately responsible for selecting the final assumptions 

the discount rate is utilized principally in calculating the actuarial present value of pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit plan costs nisource’s discount rates for both pension and other postretirement benefits are determined using spot rates along an aarated above median yield curve with cash flows matching the expected duration of benefit payments to be made to plan participants 

the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets is a component utilized in calculating annual pension and other postretirement 

item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

n i s ource  i nc  

benefit plan costs nisource estimates the expected return on plan assets by evaluating expected bond returns equity risk premiums target asset allocations the effects of active plan management the impact of periodic plan asset rebalancing and historical performance nisource also considers the guidance from its investment advisors in making a final determination of its expected rate of return on assets 

for measurement of 2018 net periodic benefit cost nisource selected an expected pretax longterm rate of return of 700 and 580 for its pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets respectively 

nisource estimates the assumed health care cost trend rate which is used in determining the companys other postretirement benefit net expense based upon its actual health care cost experience the effects of recently enacted legislation thirdparty actuarial surveys and general economic conditions 

nisource uses the society of actuaries’ most recently published mortality data in developing a best estimate of mortality as part of the calculation of the pension and other postretirement benefit obligations 

the following tables illustrate the effects of changes in these actuarial assumptions while holding all other assumptions constant 



1 before labor capitalization and regulatory deferrals 

in january 2017 nisource changed the method used to estimate the service and interest components of net periodic benefit cost for pension and other postretirement benefits this change compared to the previous method resulted in a decrease in the actuariallydetermined service and interest cost components historically nisource estimated service and interest cost utilizing a single weightedaverage discount rate derived from the yield curve used to measure the benefit obligation at the beginning of the period for fiscal 2017 and beyond nisource now utilizes a full yield curve approach to estimate these components by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows for further discussion of nisource’s pension and other postretirement benefits see note 11  “pension and other postretirement benefits” in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

goodwill  nisource has seven goodwill reporting units comprised of the seven state operating companies within the gas distribution operations reportable segment nisource’s goodwill assets at december 31 2017  were 16907 million  most of which resulted from the acquisition of columbia on november 1 2000 

as required by gaap nisource tests for impairment of goodwill on an annual basis and on an interim basis when events or circumstances indicate that a potential impairment may exist nisource’s annual goodwill test takes place in the second quarter of each year and was most recently finalized as of may 1 2017 

nisource completed a quantitative step 1 fair value measurement of its reporting units during the may 1 2016 goodwill test 

item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

n i s ource  i nc  

consistent with nisource’s historical impairment testing of goodwill fair value of the reporting units was determined based on a weighting of income and market approaches these approaches require significant judgments including appropriate longterm growth rates and discount rates for the income approach and appropriate multiples of earnings for peer companies and control premiums for the market approach a qualitative step 0 test was completed on may 1 2017 nisource assessed various assumptions events and circumstances that would have affected the estimated fair value of the reporting units in its baseline may 1 2016 test the results of this assessment indicated that it is not more likely than not that its reporting unit fair values are less than the reporting unit carrying values and no impairments are necessary 

the discount rates were derived using peer company data compiled with the assistance of a third party valuation services firm the discount rates used are subject to change based on changes in tax rates at both the state and federal level debt and equity ratios at each reporting unit and general economic conditions 

the longterm growth rate was derived by evaluating historic growth rates new business and investment opportunities beyond the near term horizon the longterm growth rate is subject to change depending on inflationary impacts to the us economy and the individual business environments in which each reporting unit operates 

the may 1 2016 test indicated the fair value of each of the reporting units that carry or are allocated goodwill exceeded their carrying values indicating that no impairment existed under the step 1 annual impairment test if the estimates of free cash flow used in this step 1 analysis had been 10 lower the resulting fair values would have still been greater than the carrying value for each of the reporting units tested holding all other assumptions constant 

revenue recognition  revenue is recorded as products and services are delivered utility revenues are billed to customers monthly on a cycle basis revenues are recorded on the accrual basis and include estimates for electricity and gas delivered but not billed refer to note 1 i “revenue recognition” in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

nisource adopted the provisions of asc 606 beginning on january 1 2018 using a modified retrospective method which was applied to all contracts no material adjustments were made to january 1 2018 opening balances as a result of the adoption and nisource does not anticipate material changes in the amount or timing of future revenue recognition as a result of the adoption of asc 606

nisource inc is an energy holding company under the public utility holding company act of 2005 whose subsidiaries are fully regulated natural gas and electric utility companies serving approximately 39 million customers in seven states nisource is the successor to an indiana corporation organized in 1987 under the name of nipsco industries inc which changed its name to nisource on april 14 1999 

nisource is one of the nation’s largest natural gas distribution companies as measured by number of customers nisource’s principal subsidiaries include nisource gas distribution group inc a natural gas distribution holding company and nipsco a gas and electric company nisource derives substantially all of its revenues and earnings from the operating results of these rateregulated businesses 

on july 1 2015 nisource completed the separation of cpg from nisource cpgs operations consisted of all of nisources columbia pipeline group operations segment prior to the separation following the separation nisource retained no ownership interest in cpg 

nisource’s reportable segments are gas distribution operations and electric operations the following is a summary of the business for each reporting segment refer to item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and note 22 segments of business in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information for each segment 

gas distribution operations 

nisource’s natural gas distribution operations serve approximately 34 million customers in seven states and operate approximately 59000 miles of pipeline through its whollyowned subsidiary nisource gas distribution group inc nisource owns six distribution subsidiaries that provide natural gas to approximately 26 million residential commercial and industrial customers in ohio pennsylvania virginia kentucky maryland and massachusetts additionally nisource also distributes natural gas to approximately 820000 customers in northern indiana through its whollyowned subsidiary nipsco 

electric operations 

nisource generates transmits and distributes electricity through its subsidiary nipsco to approximately 466000 customers in 20 counties in the northern part of indiana and engages in wholesale and transmission transactions nipsco owns and operates three coalfired electric generating stations the three operating facilities have a net capability of 2540 mw nipsco also owns and operates sugar creek a ccgt plant with net capability of 535 mw three gasfired generating units located at nipsco’s coalfired electric generating stations with a net capability of 196 mw and two hydroelectric generating plants with a net capability of 10 mw these facilities provide for a total system operating net capability of 3281 mw nipsco’s transmission system with voltages from 69000 to 345000 volts consists of 2805 circuit miles nipsco is interconnected with five neighboring electric utilities during the year ended december 31 2016 nipsco generated 664 and purchased 336 of its electric requirements 

nipsco participates in the miso transmission service and wholesale energy market the miso is a nonprofit organization created in compliance with ferc regulations to improve the flow of electricity in the regional marketplace and to enhance electric reliability additionally the miso is responsible for managing energy markets transmission constraints and the dayahead realtime ftr and ancillary markets nipsco transferred functional control of its electric transmission assets to the miso and transmission service for nipsco occurs under the miso open access transmission tariff 

business strategy 

nisource focuses its business strategy on its core rateregulated assetbased businesses with most of its operating income generated from the rateregulated businesses nisource’s utilities continue to move forward on core infrastructure and environmental investment programs supported by complementary regulatory and customer initiatives across all seven states in which it operates nisource’s goal is to develop strategies that benefit all stakeholders as it addresses changing customer conservation patterns develops more contemporary pricing structures and embarks on longterm investment programs these strategies are intended to improve reliability and safety enhance customer services and reduce emissions while generating sustainable returns 

competition and changes in the regulatory environment 

the regulatory frameworks applicable to nisource’s operations at both the state and federal levels continue to evolve these changes have had and will continue to have an impact on nisource’s operations structure and profitability management continually seeks new ways to be more competitive and profitable in this environment 

the gas distribution operations companies have pursued nontraditional revenue sources within the evolving natural gas marketplace these efforts include the sale of products and services upstream of the companies’ service territory the sale of products and services in the companies’ service territories and gas supply cost incentive mechanisms for service to their core 

item 1 business 

n i s ource  i nc  

markets the upstream products are made up of transactions that occur between an individual gas distribution operations company and a buyer for the sales of unbundled or rebundled gas supply and capacity the onsystem services are offered by nisource to customers and include products such as the transportation and balancing of gas on the gas distribution operations company system the incentive mechanisms give the gas distribution operations companies an opportunity to share in the savings created from such situations as gas purchase prices paid below an agreed upon benchmark and their ability to reduce pipeline capacity charges with their customers 

increased efficiency of natural gas appliances and improvements in home building codes and standards has contributed to a longterm trend of declining average use per customer usage for the year ended december 31 2016 decreased from the same period last year primarily due to warmer weather in the companys operating area compared to the prior year while historically rate design at the distribution level has been structured such that a large portion of cost recovery is based upon throughput rather than in a fixed charge operating costs are largely incurred on a fixed basis and do not fluctuate due to changes in customer usage as a result gas distribution operations have pursued changes in rate design to more effectively match recoveries with costs incurred each of the states in which gas distribution operations operate has different requirements regarding the procedure for establishing changes to rate design columbia of ohio restructured its rate design through a base rate proceeding and has adopted a “decoupled” rate design which more closely links the recovery of fixed costs with fixed charges columbia of massachusetts received regulatory approval of a decoupling mechanism which adjusts revenues to an approved benchmark level through a volumetric adjustment factor columbia of maryland and columbia of virginia have received regulatory approval to implement a revenue normalization adjustment for certain customer classes a decoupling mechanism whereby monthly revenues that exceed or fall short of approved levels are reconciled in subsequent months in a prior base rate proceeding columbia of pennsylvania implemented a pilot residential weather normalization adjustment columbia of kentucky has had approval for a weather normalization adjustment for many years in a prior base rate proceeding nipsco implemented a higher fixed customer charge for residential and small customer classes moving toward full straight fixed variable rate design 

natural gas competition  open access to natural gas supplies over interstate pipelines and the deregulation of the commodity price of gas has led to tremendous change in the energy markets ldc customers and marketers can purchase gas directly from producers and marketers as an open competitive market for gas supplies has emerged this separation or “unbundling” of the transportation and other services offered by pipelines and ldcs allows customers to purchase the commodity independent of services provided by the pipelines and ldcs the ldcs continue to purchase gas and recover the associated costs from their customers nisource’s gas distribution operations’ subsidiaries are involved in programs that provide customers the opportunity to purchase their natural gas requirements from third parties and use the nisource gas distribution operations’ subsidiaries for transportation services 

gas distribution operations competes with investorowned municipal and cooperative electric utilities throughout its service areas as well as other regulated and unregulated natural gas intra and interstate pipelines and other alternate fuels such as propane and fuel oil gas distribution operations continues to be a strong competitor in the energy market as a result of strong customer preference for natural gas competition with providers of electricity has traditionally been the strongest in the residential and commercial markets of kentucky southern ohio central pennsylvania and western virginia due to comparatively low electric rates natural gas competes with fuel oil and propane in the massachusetts market mainly due to the installed base of fuel oil and propanebased heating which has comprised a declining percentage of the overall market over the last few years however fuel oil and propane are more viable in today’s oil market 

electric competition  indiana electric utilities generally have exclusive service areas under indiana regulations and retail electric customers in indiana do not have the ability to choose their electric supplier nipsco faces nonutility competition from other energy sources such as selfgeneration by large industrial customers and other distributed energy sources

 item 1a risk factors 

n i s ource  i nc  

nisource’s operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties including those described below that could adversely affect the company’s business financial condition results of operations cash flows and the trading price of the company’s common stock 

nisource has substantial indebtedness which could adversely affect its financial condition 

nisource had total consolidated indebtedness of 79093 million  outstanding as of december 31 2016 the company’s substantial indebtedness could have important consequences for example it could 

 some of nisource’s debt obligations contain financial covenants related to debttocapital ratios and crossdefault provisions nisource’s failure to comply with any of these covenants could result in an event of default which if not cured or waived could result in the acceleration of outstanding debt obligations 

a drop in nisource’s credit rating could adversely impact nisource’s liquidity   

the credit rating agencies periodically review the company’s ratings taking into account factors such as our capital structure and earnings profile in 2016 moody’s affirmed the nisource senior unsecured rating of baa2 and its commercial paper rating of p2 with stable outlooks moody’s also affirmed nipsco’s baa1 rating and columbia of massachusetts’s baa2 rating with stable outlooks in 2016 standard  poor’s affirmed the bbb senior unsecured ratings of nisource and its subsidiaries and affirmed nisource’s commercial paper rating of a2 with stable outlooks in 2016 fitch upgraded the longterm issuer default ratings of nisource and nipsco to bbb and affirmed the commercial paper rating of f3 with stable outlooks 

the company is committed to maintaining investment grade credit ratings however there is no assurance we will be able to do so in the future the company’s credit ratings could be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if in its judgment the circumstances warrant any negative rating action could adversely affect our ability to access capital at rates and on terms that are attractive a negative rating action could also adversely impact our business relationships with suppliers and operating partners 

certain nisource subsidiaries have agreements that contain “ratings triggers” that require increased collateral if the credit ratings of nisource or certain of its subsidiaries are below investment grade these agreements are primarily for insurance purposes and for the physical purchase or sale of power as of december 31 2016 the collateral requirement that would be required in the event of a downgrade below the ratings trigger levels would amount to approximately 354 million  in addition to agreements with ratings triggers there are other agreements that contain “adequate assurance” or “material adverse change” provisions that could necessitate additional credit support such as letters of credit and cash collateral to transact business 

nisource may not be able to execute its business plan or growth strategy including utility infrastructure investments 

business or regulatory conditions may result in nisource not being able to execute its business plan or growth strategy including identified planned and other utility infrastructure investments nisource’s customer and regulatory initiatives may not achieve planned results utility infrastructure investments may not materialize may cease to be achievable or economically viable and may not be successfully completed natural gas may cease to be viewed as an economically and ecologically attractive fuel any of these developments could adversely affect our results of operations and growth prospects 

item 1a risk factors

adverse economic and market conditions or increases in interest rates could reduce net revenue growth increase costs decrease future net income and cash flows and impact capital resources and liquidity needs 

while the national economy is experiencing modest growth nisource cannot predict how robust future growth will be or whether or not it will be sustained deteriorating or sluggish economic conditions in nisource’s operating jurisdictions could adversely impact nisource’s ability to grow its customer base and collect revenues from customers which could reduce net revenue growth and increase operating costs 

the company relies on access to the capital markets to finance its liquidity and longterm capital requirements market turmoil could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital or refinance debt reduced access to capital markets andor increased borrowing costs could reduce future net income and cash flows refer to note 14 “longterm debt” in the notes to consolidated financial statements for information related to outstanding longterm debt and maturities of that debt 

capital market performance and other factors may decrease the value of benefit plan assets which then could require significant additional funding and impact earnings 

the performance of the capital markets affects the value of the assets that are held in trust to satisfy future obligations under defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans nisource has significant obligations in these areas and holds significant assets in these trusts these assets are subject to market fluctuations and may yield uncertain returns which fall below nisource’s projected rates of return a decline in the market value of assets may increase the funding requirements of the obligations under the defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans additionally changes in interest rates affect the liabilities under these benefit plans as interest rates decrease the liabilities increase which could potentially increase funding requirements further the funding requirements of the obligations related to these benefits plans may increase due to changes in governmental regulations and participant demographics including increased numbers of retirements or changes in life expectancy assumptions ultimately significant funding requirements and increased pension or other postretirement benefit plan expense could negatively impact nisource’s results of operations and financial position 

the majority of nisource’s net revenues are subject to economic regulation and are exposed to the impact of regulatory rate reviews and proceedings 

most of nisource’s net revenues are subject to economic regulation at either the federal or state level as such the net revenues generated by those regulated companies are subject to regulatory review by the applicable federal or state authority these rate reviews determine the rates charged to customers and directly impact revenues nisource’s financial results are dependent on frequent regulatory proceedings in order to ensure timely recovery of costs additionally the costs of complying with future changes in environmental laws and regulations are expected to be significant and their recovery through rates will be contingent on regulatory approval 

as a result of efforts to introduce marketbased competition in certain markets where the regulated businesses conduct operations nisource may compete with independent marketers for customers this competition exposes nisource to the risk that certain stranded costs may not be recoverable and may affect results of nisource’s growth strategy and financial position 

failure to adapt to advances in technology could make nisource less competitive 

a key element of nisource’s business model is that generating power at central station power plants achieves economies of scale and produces power at a competitive cost research and development activities are ongoing for new technologies that produce power or reduce power consumption these technologies include renewable energy customeroriented generation energy storage and energy efficiency advances in technology or changes in laws or regulations could reduce the cost of these or other alternative methods of producing power to a level that is competitive with that of most central station power electric production or result in smallerscale more fuel efficient andor more cost effective distributed generation this could cause our market share to erode and the value of our generating facilities to decline in addition a failure by nisource to effectively adapt to changes in technology could harm nisource’s ability to remain competitive in the marketplace for its products services and processes 

item 1a risk factors 

n i s ource  i nc  

nisource is exposed to significant reputational risks which make it vulnerable to a loss of cost recovery increased litigation and negative public perception 

as a utility company nisource is subject to adverse publicity focused on the reliability of our services and the speed with which nisource is able to respond effectively to electric outages natural gas leaks and similar interruptions caused by storm damage or other unanticipated events as well as our own or third parties actions or failure to act if customers legislators or regulators have or develop a negative opinion of nisource this could result in less favorable legislative and regulatory outcomes or increased regulatory oversight increased litigation and negative public perception the imposition of any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on the business results of operations cash flow and financial condition of nisource 

nisource’s businesses are regulated under numerous environmental laws the cost of compliance with these laws and changes to or additions to or reinterpretations of the laws could be significant liability from the failure to comply with existing or changed laws could have a material adverse effect on the business results of operations cash flows and the financial condition of nisource 

nisource’s businesses are subject to extensive federal state and local environmental laws and rules that regulate among other things air emissions water usage and discharges and waste products such as coal combustion residuals compliance with these legal obligations requires nisource to make expenditures for installation of pollution control equipment remediation environmental monitoring emissions fees and permits at many of nisource’s facilities these expenditures are significant and nisource expects that they will continue to be significant in the future furthermore if nisource fails to comply with environmental laws and regulations or is found to have caused damage to the environment or persons even if caused by factors beyond nisource’s control that failure or harm may result in the assessment of civil or criminal penalties and damages against nisource and injunctions to remedy the failure or harm 

existing environmental laws and regulations may be revised and new laws and regulations seeking to increase environmental regulation of the energy industry may be adopted or become applicable to nisource revised or additional laws and regulations may result in significant additional expense and operating restrictions on nisource’s facilities or increased compliance costs which may not be fully recoverable from customers through regulated rates and could therefore impact nisource’s financial position financial results and cash flow moreover such costs could materially affect the continued economic viability of one or more of nisource’s facilities 

an area of significant uncertainty and risk are the laws concerning emission of ghg because nisource operates fossil fuel facilities emissions of ghgs are an expected and unavoidable aspect of the business while nisource continues to reduce ghg emissions through efficiency programs leak detection and other programs ghg emissions cannot be eliminated revised or additional future ghg legislation andor regulation could materially impact nisource’s financial position financial results and cash flows 

even in instances where legal and regulatory requirements are already known or anticipated the original cost estimates for environmental capital projects remediation of past harm or the costs of operating pollution reduction strategies or equipment can differ materially from the amount ultimately expended the actual future expenditures depend on many factors including the nature and extent of impact the method of cleanup the cost of raw materials contractor costs and the availability of cost recovery changes in costs and the ability to recover under regulatory mechanisms could affect nisource’s financial position financial results and cash flows 

a significant portion of the gas and electricity nisource sells is used by residential and commercial customers for heating and air conditioning accordingly fluctuations in weather gas and electricity commodity costs and economic conditions impact demand of our customers and our operating results 

energy sales are sensitive to variations in weather forecasts of energy sales are based on normal weather which represents a longterm historical average significant variations from normal weather could have and have had a material impact on energy sales additionally residential usage and to some degree commercial usage is sensitive to fluctuations in commodity costs for gas and electricity whereby usage declines with increased costs thus affecting nisource’s financial results lastly residential and commercial customers’ usage is sensitive to economic conditions and factors such as unemployment consumption and consumer confidence therefore prevailing economic conditions may affect nisource’s financial results 

nisource’s business operations are subject to economic conditions in certain industries 

business operations throughout nisource’s service territories have been and may continue to be adversely affected by economic events at the national and local level where it operates in particular sales to large industrial customers such as those in the steel

oil refining industrial gas and related industries may be impacted by economic downturns the us manufacturing industry continues to adjust to changing market conditions including international competition increasing costs and fluctuating demand for its products 

the implementation of nipsco’s electric generation strategy including the retirement of its coal generation units may not achieve intended results 

on november 1 2016 nipsco submitted its integrated resource plan with the iurc setting forth its short and longterm electric generation plans in an effort to maintain affordability while providing reliable flexible and cleaner sources of power however there are inherent risks and uncertainties including changes in market conditions environmental regulations commodity costs and customer expectations which may impede nipsco’s ability to achieve these intended results in addition the integrated resource plan included an intention to retire the bailly coal generation units units 7 and 8 as soon as mid2018 and two units units 17 and 18 at the rm schahfer generating station by the end of 2023 the miso subsequently approved nipsco’s plan to retire the two bailly coal generation units by may 31 2018 nipsco’s electric generation strategy could require significant future capital expenditures operating costs and charges to earnings that may negatively impact nisource’s financial position financial results and cash flows 

fluctuations in the price of energy commodities or their related transportation costs may have a negative impact on nisource’s financial results 

nisource’s electric generating fleet is dependent on coal and natural gas for fuel and its gas distribution operations purchase and resell much of the natural gas they deliver these energy commodities are vulnerable to price fluctuations and fluctuations in associated transportation costs from time to time nisource has used hedging in order to offset fluctuations in commodity supply prices nisource relies on regulatory recovery mechanisms in the various jurisdictions in order to fully recover the commodity costs incurred in operations however while nisource has historically been successful in recovery of costs related to such commodity prices there can be no assurance that such costs will be fully recovered through rates in a timely manner 

nisource is exposed to risk that customers will not remit payment for delivered energy or services and that suppliers or counterparties will not perform under various financial or operating agreements 

nisource’s extension of credit is governed by a corporate credit risk policy involves considerable judgment and is based on an evaluation of a customer or counterparty’s financial condition credit history and other factors nisource monitors its credit risk exposure   by obtaining credit reports and updated financial information for customers and suppliers and by evaluating the financial status of its banking partners and other counterparties by reference to marketbased metrics such as credit default swap pricing levels and to traditional credit ratings provided by the major credit rating agencies adverse economic conditions could result in an increase in defaults by customers suppliers and counterparties 

nisource has significant goodwill and definitelived intangible assets an impairment of goodwill or definitelived intangible assets could result in a significant charge to earnings and negatively impact nisources compliance with certain covenants under financing agreements 

in accordance with gaap nisource tests goodwill for impairment at least annually and reviews its definitelived intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable goodwill also is tested for impairment when factors examples of which include reduced cash flow estimates a sustained decline in stock price or market capitalization below book value indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable nisource would be required to record a charge in its financial statements for the period in which any impairment of the goodwill or definitelived intangible assets is determined negatively impacting the results of operations a significant charge could impact the capitalization ratio covenant under certain financing agreements nisource is subject to a financial covenant under its fiveyear revolving credit facility which requires nisource to maintain a debt to capitalization ratio that does not exceed 70 a similar covenant in a 2005 private placement note purchase agreement requires nisource to maintain a debt to capitalization ratio that does not exceed 75 as of december 31 2016 the ratio was 66  

changes in taxation and the ability to quantify such changes could adversely affect nisource’s financial results 

nisource is subject to taxation by the various taxing authorities at the federal state and local levels where it does business legislation or regulation which could affect nisource’s tax burden could be enacted by any of these governmental authorities for example the trump administration has recently called for substantial change to fiscal and tax policies which may include comprehensive tax reform nisource cannot predict the timing or extent of such taxrelated developments which could have a negative impact on the financial results separately a challenge by a taxing authority nisource’s ability to utilize tax benefits 

item 1a risk factors 

n i s ource  i nc  

such as carryforwards or tax credits or a deviation from other taxrelated assumptions may cause actual financial results to deviate from previous estimates additionally nisource uses its best judgment in attempting to quantify and reserve for these tax obligations 

changes in accounting principles may adversely affect nisource’s financial results 

future changes in accounting rules and associated changes in regulatory accounting may negatively impact the way nisource records revenues expenses assets and liabilities these changes in accounting standards may adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations 

distribution of natural gas and the generation transmission and distribution of electricity involve numerous risks that may result in incidents and other operating risks and costs 

nisources gas distribution activities as well as generation transmission and distribution of electricity involve a variety of inherent hazards and operating risks such as gas leaks downed power lines incidents including thirdparty damages large scale outages and mechanical problems which could cause substantial financial losses in addition these risks could result in serious injury or loss of life to employees and the general public significant damage to property environmental pollution impairment of its operations adverse regulatory rulings and reputational harm which in turn could lead to substantial losses to nisource the location of pipeline facilities or generation transmission substation and distribution facilities near populated areas including residential areas commercial business centers and industrial sites could increase the level of damages resulting from such events the occurrence of such events could adversely affect nisources financial position and results of operations in accordance with customary industry practice nisource maintains insurance against some but not all of these risks and losses 

aging infrastructure may lead to disruptions in operations and increased capital expenditures and maintenance costs all of which could negatively impact nisource’s financial results 

nisource has risks associated with aging infrastructure assets the age of these assets may result in a need for replacement a higher level of maintenance costs and unscheduled outages despite efforts by nisource to properly maintain or upgrade these assets through inspection scheduled maintenance and capital investment the failure to operate these assets as desired could result in incidents and in nisource’s inability to meet firm service obligations adversely impacting revenues and could also result in increased capital expenditures and maintenance costs which if not fully recovered from customers could negatively impact nisources financial results 

the impacts of climate change natural disasters acts of terrorism or other catastrophic events may disrupt operations and reduce the ability to service customers 

a disruption or failure of natural gas distribution systems or within electric generation transmission or distribution systems in the event of a major hurricane tornado terrorist attack or other catastrophic event could cause delays in completing sales providing services or performing other critical functions nisource has experienced disruptions in the past from hurricanes and tornadoes and other events of this nature the occurrence of such events could adversely affect nisources financial position and results of operations in accordance with customary industry practice nisource maintains insurance against some but not all of these risks and losses there is also a concern that climate change may exacerbate the risks to physical infrastructure such risks include heat stresses to power lines storms that damage infrastructure lake and sea level changes that damage the manner in which services are currently provided droughts or other stresses on water used to supply services and other extreme weather conditions climate change and the costs that may be associated with its impacts have the potential to affect nisource’s business in many ways including increasing the cost nisource incurs in providing its products and services impacting the demand for and consumption of its products and services due to change in both costs and weather patterns and affecting the economic health of the regions in which nisource operates 

a cyberattack on any of nisources or certain thirdparty computer systems upon which nisource relies may adversely affect its ability to operate 

nisource is reliant on technology to run its businesses which are dependent upon financial and operational computer systems to process critical information necessary to conduct various elements of its business including the generation transmission and distribution of electricity operation of its gas pipeline facilities and the recording and reporting of commercial and financial transactions to regulators investors and other stakeholders any failure of nisource’s computer systems or those of its customers suppliers or others with whom it does business could materially disrupt nisource’s ability to operate its business and could result in a financial loss and possibly do harm to nisource’s reputation 

item 1a risk factors 

n i s ource  i nc  

additionally nisources information systems experience ongoing often sophisticated cyberattacks by a variety of sources with the apparent aim to breach nisources cyberdefenses although nisource attempts to maintain adequate defenses to these attacks and works through industry groups and trade associations to identify common threats and assess nisources countermeasures a security breach of nisources information systems could i impact the reliability of nisources generation transmission and distribution systems and potentially negatively impact nisources compliance with certain mandatory reliability standards ii subject nisource to harm associated with theft or inappropriate release of certain types of information such as system operating information or information personal or otherwise relating to nisources customers or employees andor iii impact nisources ability to manage nisources businesses 

nisources capital projects and programs subject the company to construction risks and natural gas costs and supply risks 

nisource is engaged in intrastate natural gas pipeline modernization programs to maintain system integrity and enhance service reliability and flexibility nipsco also is currently engaged in a number of capital projects including environmental improvements to its electric generating stations as well as the construction of new transmission facilities as nisource undertakes these projects and programs it may not be able to complete them on schedule or at the anticipated costs additionally nisource may construct or purchase some of these projects and programs to capture anticipated future growth in natural gas production which may not materialize and may cause the construction to occur over an extended period of time nisource also may not receive material increases in revenue and cash flows until after the completion of the projects and programs 

sustained extreme weather conditions may negatively impact nisource’s operations 

nisource conducts its operations across a wide geographic area subject to varied and potentially extreme weather conditions which may from time to time persist for sustained periods of time despite preventative maintenance efforts persistent weather related stress on nisource’s infrastructure may reveal weaknesses in its systems not previously known to the company or otherwise present various operational challenges across all business segments further adverse weather may affect nisource’s ability to conduct operations in a manner that satisfies customer expectations or contractual obligations including by causing service disruptions 

failure to attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce could harm nisource’s results of operations 

nisource operates in an industry that requires many of its employees to possess unique technical skill sets events such as an aging workforce without appropriate replacements the mismatch of skill sets to future needs or the unavailability of contract resources may lead to operating challenges or increased costs these operating challenges include lack of resources loss of knowledge and a lengthy time period associated with skill development in addition current and prospective employees may determine that they do not wish to work for nisource due to market economic employment and other conditions failure to hire and retain qualified employees including the ability to transfer significant internal historical knowledge and expertise to the new employees may adversely affect nisource’s ability to manage and operate its business if nisource is unable to successfully attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce its results of operations could be adversely affected 

nisource is a holding company and is dependent on cash generated by subsidiaries to meet its debt obligations and pay dividends on its common stock 

nisource is a holding company and conducts its operations primarily through its subsidiaries substantially all of nisource’s consolidated assets are held by its subsidiaries accordingly nisource’s ability to meet its debt obligations or pay dividends on its common stock is largely dependent upon cash generated by these subsidiaries in the event a major subsidiary is not able to pay dividends or transfer cash flows to nisource nisources ability to service its debt obligations or pay dividends could be negatively affected 

following the separation all of the entities formerly included in nisources columbia pipeline group operations segment have been separated from nisource and are held by a separate company cpg the related assets are no longer held by subsidiaries of nisource which may negatively affect nisources ability to service its debt obligations or pay dividends 

the separation may result in significant tax liabilities 

the separation was conditioned on the receipt by nisource of a legal opinion to the effect that the distribution of cpg shares to nisource stockholders is expected to qualify as taxfree under section 355 of the us internal revenue code even though nisource has received such an opinion the irs could determine on audit that the distribution is taxable both nisource and its stockholders could incur significant us federal income tax liabilities if taxing authorities conclude the distribution is taxable

executive summary 

nisource is an energy holding company under the public utility holding company act of 2005 whose subsidiaries are fully regulated natural gas and electric utility companies serving customers in seven states nisource generates substantially all of its operating income through these rateregulated businesses which are summarized for financial reporting purposes into two primary reportable segments gas distribution operations and electric operations 

refer to the business section under item 1 of this report and note 22 segments of business in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our regulated utility business segments 

nisource’s goal is to develop strategies that benefit all stakeholders as it addresses changing customer conservation patterns develops more contemporary pricing structures and embarks on longterm investment programs these strategies are intended to improve reliability and safety enhance customer services and reduce emissions while generating sustainable returns additionally nisource continues to pursue regulatory and legislative initiatives that will allow residential customers not currently on nisources system to obtain gas service in a cost effective manner 

summary of consolidated financial results 

on a consolidated basis nisource reported higher income from continuing operations of 3281 million  or 102  per basic share for the twelve months ended december 31 2016  compared to 1986 million  or 063  per basic share for the same period in 2015  the increase in income from continuing operations during 2016  was due primarily to increased operating income as discussed below along with a 972 million loss on early extinguishment of longterm debt recorded as a result of the debt restructuring that occurred in 2015 as part of the separation 

for the twelve months ended december 31 2016  nisource reported operating income of 8582 million  compared to 7999 million  for the same period in 2015  the higher operating income was primarily due to increased net revenues from regulatory and service programs and increased rates from incremental capital spend on electric transmission projects at nipsco partially offset by lower net revenues due to warmer than normal weather operating expenses increased due to higher outside service costs primarily due to generationrelated maintenance increased depreciation expense plant retirement costs and higher employee and administrative expenses partially offset by decreased property taxes and lower environmental expenses 

these factors and other impacts to the financial results are discussed in more detail within the following discussions of “results of operations” “results and discussion of segment operations” and “liquidity and capital resources”

capital investment  in 2016  nisource invested approximately 15 billion  in capital expenditures across its gas and electric utilities these expenditures were primarily aimed at furthering the safety and reliability of our gas distribution system construction of new electric transmission assets and maintaining nisource’s existing electric generation fleet nisource continues to execute on an estimated 30 billion in total projected longterm regulated utility infrastructure investments and expects to invest approximately 16 billion to 17 billion  in capital during 2017  to continue to modernize and improve its system across all seven states 

liquidity  nisource believes that through income generated from operating activities amounts available under its shortterm revolving credit facility commercial paper program accounts receivable securitization facilities longterm debt agreements and nisource’s ability to access the capital markets there is adequate capital available to fund its operating activities and capital expenditures in 2017  and beyond at december 31 2016  and 2015  nisource had approximately 6837 million  and 11794 million  respectively of net liquidity available consisting of cash and available capacity under credit facilities 

regulatory developments 

in 2016  nisource continued to move forward on core infrastructure and environmental investment programs supported by complementary regulatory and customer initiatives across all seven states of its operating area the discussion below summarizes significant regulatory developments that transpired during 2016

results of operations 

operating income 

substantially all of nisources operating income is generated by the gas distribution operations and electric operations segments the results of which are discussed in further detail within results and discussion of segment operations 

other income deductions 

other income deductions in 2016  reduced income 3480 million  compared to a reduction of 4600 million  in 2015  this change is primarily due to a loss on early extinguishment of longterm debt of 972 million in 2015 and decreased interest expense of 307 million primarily resulting from maturities of longterm debt these changes were partially offset by a 2016 charge resulting from a tax notice impacting nipscos tuas refer to note 18e other matters in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information on nipscos tuas 

other income deductions in 2015 reduced income 4600 million compared to a reduction of 3661 million in 2014 the increase in deductions is primarily due to a loss on early extinguishment of longterm debt of 972 million 

income taxes

gas distribution operations continued 

nisource analyzes its operating results using net revenues net revenues are calculated as gross revenues less the associated cost of sales excluding depreciation and amortization cost of sales at the gas distribution operations segment is principally comprised of the cost of natural gas used while providing transportation and distribution services to its customers 

nisource believes net revenues are a better measure to analyze profitability than gross revenues because the majority of the cost of sales are tracked costs that are passed through directly to the customer resulting in an equal and offsetting amount reflected in gross revenues 

comparability of line item operating results may also be impacted by regulatory tax and depreciation trackers other than those for cost of sales that allow for the recovery in rates of certain costs such as bad debt expense therefore increases in these tracked operating expenses are offset by increases in net revenues and have essentially no impact on income from continuing operations 

2016 vs 2015 operating income 

for 2016  gas distribution operations reported operating income of 5740 million  an increase  of 182 million  from the comparable 2015  period 

net revenues for 2016  were 19352 million  an increase  of 216 million  from the same period in 2015  the change in net revenues was primarily driven by

 weather 

in general nisource calculates the weatherrelated revenue variance based on changing customer demand driven by weather variance from normal heating degree days nisources composite heating degree days reported do not directly correlate to the weatherrelated dollar impact on the results of gas distribution operations heating degree days experienced during different times of the year or in different operating locations may have more or less impact on volume and dollars depending on when and where they occur when the detailed results are combined for reporting there may be weatherrelated dollar impacts on operations when there is not an apparent or significant change in the aggregated nisource composite heating degree day comparison 

weather in the gas distribution operations service territories for 2016  was about 9  warmer than normal and about 6  warmer than 2015  decreasing net revenues 124 million for the year ended december 31 2016  compared to 2015  

weather in the gas distribution operations service territories for 2015  was about 3 warmer than normal and about 12 warmer than 2014  decreasing net revenues 306 million for the year ended december 31 2015  compared to 2014  

throughput 

total volumes sold and transported for the year ended december 31 2016  were 9717  mmdth compared to 9887  mmdth for 2015  this decrease is primarily attributable to warmer weather experienced in 2016  compared to 2015  

total volumes sold and transported for the year ended december 31 2015  were 9887  mmdth compared to 10425 mmdth for 2014  this decrease is primarily attributable to warmer weather and lower offsystem sales opportunities experienced in 2015  compared to 2014  

economic conditions 

all nisource gas distribution operations companies have stateapproved recovery mechanisms that provide a means for full recovery of prudently incurred gas costs gas costs are treated as passthrough costs and have no impact on the net revenues recorded in the period the gas costs included in revenues are matched with the gas cost expense recorded in the period and the difference is recorded on the consolidated balance sheets as underrecovered or overrecovered gas cost to be included in future customer billings 

at nipsco sales revenues and customer billings are adjusted for amounts related to under and overrecovered purchased gas costs from prior periods per regulatory order these amounts are primarily reflected in the “other” gross revenues statistic provided at the beginning of this segment discussion the adjustments to other gross revenues for the twelve months ended december 31 2016  2015  and 2014  were a revenue increase of 433 million a revenue decrease of 680 million and a revenue increase of 342 million respectively 

certain gas distribution operations companies continue to offer choice opportunities where customers can choose to purchase gas from a thirdparty supplier through regulatory initiatives in their respective jurisdictions these programs serve to further reduce nisources exposure to gas prices

electric operations continued 

nisource analyzes its operating results using net revenues net revenues are calculated as gross revenues less the associated cost of sales excluding depreciation and amortization cost of sales at the electric operations segment is principally comprised of the cost of coal related handling costs and natural gas purchased for the internal generation of electricity at nipsco and the cost of power purchased from thirdparty generators of electricity 

nisource believes net revenues are a better measure to analyze profitability than gross revenues because the majority of the cost of sales are tracked costs that are passed through directly to the customer resulting in an equal and offsetting amount reflected in gross revenues 

comparability of line item operating results may also be impacted by regulatory and depreciation trackers other than those for cost of sales that allow for the recovery in rates of certain costs such as bad debt expense therefore increases in these tracked operating expenses are offset by increases in net revenues and have essentially no impact on income from continuing operations 

2016 vs 2015 operating income 

for 2016  electric operations reported operating income of 2914 million  an increase  of 270 million  from the comparable 2015  period

 weather 

in general nisource calculates the weatherrelated revenue variance based on changing customer demand driven by weather variance from normal cooling degree days nisources composite cooling degree days reported do not directly correlate to the weatherrelated dollar impact on the results of electric operations cooling degree days experienced during different times of the year may have more or less impact on volume and dollars depending on when they occur when the detailed results are combined for reporting there may be weatherrelated dollar impacts on operations when there is not an apparent or significant change in the aggregated nisource composite cooling degree day comparison 

weather in the electric operations’ territories for the twelve months ended   december 31 2016  was 23  warmer than normal and 30  warmer than the same period in 2015  leading to an increase in net revenues of approximately 156 million for the twelve months ended   december 31 2016  compared to 2015  

weather in the electric operations’ territories for the twelve months ended december 31 2015 was 5  cooler than normal and 15  warmer than the same period in 2014 increasing net revenues approximately 07 million for the twelve months ended december 31 2015 compared to 2014 

sales 

electric operations sales were 168312  gwh for the year ended 2016  an increase  of 729  gwh compared to 2015  a 04   increase  

electric operations sales were 167583  gwh for the year ended 2015  a decrease of 14280 gwh compared to 2014  the 79 decrease is primarily attributable to a decrease in industrial usage which was caused by a reduction in steel production due to the high levels of imports that have impacted the domestic steel market since the start of 2015 

economic conditions 

nipsco has a stateapproved recovery mechanism that provides a means for full recovery of prudently incurred fuel costs fuel costs are treated as passthrough costs and have no impact on the net revenues recorded in the period the fuel costs included in revenues are matched with the fuel cost expense recorded in the period and the difference is recorded on the consolidated balance sheets as underrecovered or overrecovered fuel cost to be included in future customer billings 

at nipsco sales revenues and customer billings are adjusted for amounts related to under and overrecovered purchased fuel costs from prior periods per regulatory order these amounts are primarily reflected in the “other” gross revenues statistic provided at the beginning of this segment discussion the adjustments to other gross revenues for the twelve months ended december 31 2016  2015  and 2014  were a revenue increase of 331 million and a revenue decrease of 116 million and 255 million respectively 

nipscos performance remains closely linked to the performance of the steel industry nipsco’s mwh sales to steelrelated industries accounted for approximately 523 and 542 of the total industrial mwh sales for the years ended december 31 2016 and 2015 respectively 

electric supply 

nipsco 2016 integrated resource plan environmental regulatory and economic factors including low natural gas prices and aging coalfired units have led nipsco to consider modifying its current electric generation supply mix to include less coalfired generation   due to enacted ccr and elg legislation nipsco would expect to incur over 1 billion  in operating maintenance environmental and other costs over the next seven years if the current fleet of coalfired generating units remain operational 

on november 1 2016 nipsco submitted its 2016 integrated resource plan with the iurc the plan evaluates demandside and supplyside resource alternatives to reliably and cost effectively meet nipsco customers future energy requirements over the next twenty years the 2016 integrated resource plan indicates that the most viable option for customers and nipsco involves the retirement of bailly generating station units 7 and 8 as soon as mid2018 and two units units 17 and 18 at the rm schahfer generating station by the end of 2023 it is projected over the long term that the cost to customers to retire these units at these dates will be lower than maintaining and upgrading them for continuing generation

electric operations continued 

nisource and nipsco committed to the retirement of the bailly generating station units in connection with the filing of the 2016 integrated resource plan however retirement of these units is subject to the approval of the miso which is responsible for coordinating controlling and monitoring the use of the electric transmission system by utilities generators and marketers across parts of 15 us states and the canadian province of manitoba in the fourth quarter of 2016 the miso approved nipscos plan to retire the bailly generating station units by may 31 2018 

in connection with the misos approval of nipscos planned retirement of the bailly generating station units nisource recorded 221 million of plant retirementrelated charges in the fourth quarter of 2016 these charges were comprised of contract termination charges related to nipscos capital lease with pure air voluntary employee severance benefits and write downs of certain materials and supplies inventory balances refer to note 5 “property plant and equipment” and note 18e other matters in the notes to consolidated financial statements for information

liquidity and capital resources 

operating activities 

net cash from operating activities from continuing operations for the year ended december 31 2016  was 8041 million  a decrease  of 3593 million  from 2015  this decrease was driven by a combination of changes in weather gas prices and the related approved rates for recovery which significantly impacted regulatory assets regulatory liabilities and working capital between the two periods during 2015 natural gas prices were declining faster than the gas cost adjustments being collected from customers resulting in an associated source of cash from working capital during 2016 these overcollected gas costs from 2015 were returned to customers resulting in a use of working capital 

net cash from operating activities from continuing operations for the year ended december 31 2015  was 11634 million  an increase of 4022 million  from 2014 the increase in net cash from operating activities from continuing operations was primarily due to the change in regulatory assetsliabilities as well as the change in inventories as a result of lower gas prices and warmer weather in 2015 compared to 2014 

pension and other postretirement plan funding  in 2016  nisource contributed 33 million  to its pension plans and 255 million  to its postretirement medical and life plans in 2017  nisource expects to make contributions of approximately 91 million  to its pension plans and approximately 253 million  to its postretirement medical and life plans at december 31 2016  nisource’s pension and other postretirement benefit plans were underfunded by 4149 million  and 2976 million  respectively 

income taxes as of december 31 2016  nisource has a recorded deferred tax asset of 6009 million  related to a federal nol carryforward as a result of being in an nol position nisource was not required to make any cash payments for federal income tax purposes during the years ended december 31 2016  and 2015 this nol carryforward starts to expire in 2030 however nisource expects to fully utilize the carryforward benefit prior to its expiration 

investing activities 

the table below reflects capital expenditures and certain other investing activities by segment for 2016  2015  and 2014    



1  amounts differ from those presented on the statements of consolidated cash flows primarily due to the inclusion of capital expenditures included in current liabilities and afudc equity 

for 2017  nisource projects to invest approximately 16 billion to 17 billion in its capital program this projected increase over 2016 spend is driven by generation maintenance at the electric operations segment and additional system growth and tracker opportunities at the gas distribution operations and electric operations segments 

for 2016  the capital expenditures and certain other investing activities were 14904 million  which was 1229 million higher than the 2015  capital program this increased spending is mainly due to modernization projects and segment growth at the gas distribution operations segment 

for 2015  capital expenditures and certain other investing activities were 13675 million  which is 279 million higher than the 2014 capital program this increased spending is mainly due to increased tdsic spend in the gas distribution operations segment partially offset by lower tracker program spend at the electric operations segment

shortterm debt  refer to note 15 “shortterm borrowings” in the notes to consolidated financial statements for information on shortterm debt 

longterm debt  refer to note 14 “longterm debt” in the notes to consolidated financial statements for information on longterm debt 

net available liquidity as of december 31 2016  an aggregate of 6837 million  of net liquidity was available including cash and credit available under the revolving credit facility and accounts receivable securitization programs 

the following table displays nisources liquidity position as of december 31 2016  and 2015  



1 represents the lesser of the seasonal limit or maximum borrowings supportable by the underlying receivables 

the change in net available liquidity between 2016 and 2015 was driven by low utilization of shortterm debt in the prior year as a result of cash proceeds received from cpg in the separation in 2015 

debt covenants   nisource is subject to financial covenants under its revolving credit facility and term loan agreement which require nisource to maintain a debt to capitalization ratio that does not exceed 70  a similar covenant in a 2005 private placement note purchase agreement requires nisource to maintain a debt to capitalization ratio that does not exceed 75  as of december 31 2016  the ratio was 66  

sale of trade accounts receivables   refer to note 17 “transfers of financial assets” in the notes to consolidated financial statements for information on the sale of trade accounts receivable 

credit ratings   the credit rating agencies periodically review the company’s ratings taking into account factors such as its capital structure and earnings profile in june 2016 moody’s affirmed the nisource senior unsecured rating of baa2 and its commercial paper rating of p2 with stable outlooks moody’s also affirmed nipsco’s baa1 rating and columbia of massachusetts’s baa2 rating with stable outlooks in august 2016 standard  poor’s affirmed the bbb senior unsecured rating of nisource and its subsidiaries and its commercial paper rating of a2 with stable outlooks in june 2016 fitch upgraded the longterm issuer default ratings of nisource and nipsco to bbb and affirmed the commercial paper rating of f3 with stable outlooks 

certain nisource subsidiaries have agreements that contain “ratings triggers” that require increased collateral if the credit ratings of nisource or certain of its subsidiaries are below investment grade these agreements are primarily for insurance purposes and for the physical purchase or sale of power as of december 31 2016  the collateral requirement that would be required in the event of a downgrade below the ratings trigger levels would amount to approximately 354 million  in addition to agreements with ratings triggers there are other agreements that contain “adequate assurance” or “material adverse change” provisions that could necessitate additional credit support such as letters of credit and cash collateral to transact business

2   capital lease payments shown above are inclusive of interest totaling 926 million   

3 operating lease balances do not include amounts for fleet leases that can be renewed beyond the initial lease term the company anticipates renewing the leases beyond the initial term but the anticipated payments associated with the renewals do not meet the definition of expected minimum lease payments and therefore are not included above expected payments are 311 million in 2017 329 million in 2018 261 million in 2019 175 million in 2020 80 million in 2021 and 20 million thereafter   

4 in january 2017 nipsco signed new coal contract commitments of 242 million and 101 million for 2017 and 2018 respectively these contracts are not included above 

nisource calculated estimated interest payments for longterm debt as follows for the fixedrate debt interest is calculated based on the stated coupon and payment dates for variablerate debt interest rates used are those that are in place as of december 31 2016  for 2017  nisource projects that it will be required to make interest payments of approximately 356 million which includes 3379 million  of interest payments related to its longterm debt outstanding as of december 31 2016  at december 31 2016  nisource also had 14880 million  in shortterm borrowings outstanding 

nisource’s expected payments included within “other liabilities” in the table of contractual commitments above contains employer contributions to pension and other postretirement benefits plans expected to be made in 2017  plan contributions beyond 2017  are dependent upon a number of factors including actual returns on plan assets which cannot be reliably estimated at this time in 2017  nisource expects to make contributions of approximately 91 million  to its pension plans and approximately 253 million  to its postretirement medical and life plans refer to note 11 “pension and other postretirement benefits” in the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information 

nisource cannot reasonably estimate the settlement amounts or timing of cash flows related to longterm obligations classified as “total other liabilities” on the consolidated balance sheets other than those described above 

nisource also has obligations associated with income property gross receipts franchise payroll sales and use and various other taxes and expects to make tax payments of approximately 2147 million in 2017  which are not included in the table above

market risk disclosures 

risk is an inherent part of nisource’s businesses the extent to which nisource properly and effectively identifies assesses monitors and manages each of the various types of risk involved in its businesses is critical to its profitability nisource seeks to identify assess monitor and manage in accordance with defined policies and procedures the following principal market risks that are involved in nisource’s businesses commodity price risk interest rate risk and credit risk risk management at nisource is a multifaceted process with oversight by the risk management committee that requires constant communication judgment and knowledge of specialized products and markets nisource’s senior management takes an active role in the risk management process and has developed policies and procedures that require specific administrative and business functions to assist in the identification assessment and control of various risks these may include but are not limited to market operational financial compliance and strategic risk types in recognition of the increasingly varied and complex nature of the energy business nisource’s risk management process policies and procedures continue to evolve and are subject to ongoing review and modification   

commodity price risk 

nisource is exposed to commodity price risk as a result of its subsidiaries’ operations involving natural gas and power to manage this market risk nisource’s subsidiaries use derivatives including commodity futures contracts swaps forwards and options nisource does not participate in speculative energy trading activity 

commodity price risk resulting from derivative activities at nisource’s rateregulated subsidiaries is limited since regulations allow recovery of prudently incurred purchased power fuel and gas costs through the ratemaking process including gains or losses on these derivative instruments if states should explore additional regulatory reform these subsidiaries may begin providing services without the benefit of the traditional ratemaking process and may be more exposed to commodity price risk 

nisource subsidiaries are required to make cash margin deposits with their brokers to cover actual and potential losses in the value of outstanding exchange traded derivative contracts the amount of these deposits which are reflected in nisource’s restricted cash balance may fluctuate significantly during periods of high volatility in the energy commodity markets 

refer to note 9 risk management activities in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information on nisources commodity price risk assets and liabilities as of december 31 2016  and 2015  

interest rate risk 

nisource is exposed to interest rate risk as a result of changes in interest rates on borrowings under its revolving credit agreement commercial paper program and accounts receivable programs which have interest rates that are indexed to shortterm market interest rates based upon average borrowings and debt obligations subject to fluctuations in shortterm market interest rates an increase or decrease in shortterm interest rates of 100 basis points 1 would have increased or decreased interest expense by 117 million  and 82 million  for the years 2016  and 2015  respectively nisource and its subsidiaries manage interest rate risk on longterm debt through forward starting interest rate swaps that hedge the interest rate risk related to forecasted issuances nisource is also exposed to interest rate risk as a result of changes in benchmark rates that can influence the interest rates of future debt issuances 

refer to note 9 risk management activities in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information on nisources interest rate risk assets and liabilities as of december 31 2016  and 2015    

credit risk 

due to the nature of the industry credit risk is embedded in many of nisource’s business activities nisource’s extension of credit is governed by a corporate credit risk policy in addition risk management committee guidelines are in place which document management approval levels for credit limits evaluation of creditworthiness and credit risk mitigation efforts exposures to credit risks are monitored by the risk management function which is independent of commercial operations credit risk arises due to the possibility that a customer supplier or counterparty will not be able or willing to fulfill its obligations on a transaction on or before the settlement date for derivativerelated contracts credit risk arises when counterparties are obligated to deliver or purchase defined commodity units of gas or power to nisource at a future date per execution of contractual terms and conditions exposure to credit risk is measured in terms of both current obligations and the market value of forward positions net of any posted collateral such as cash and letters of credit 

nisource closely monitors the financial status of its banking credit providers nisource evaluates the financial status of its banking partners through the use of marketbased metrics such as credit default swap pricing levels and also through traditional credit ratings provided by major credit rating agencies

fair value measurement 

nisource measures certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value the level of the fair value hierarchy disclosed is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement nisource’s financial assets and liabilities include price risk management assets and liabilities and availableforsale securities 

nisources risk management assets and liabilities can generally be grouped into commodity purchase contracts used to economically hedge against future changes in the price of coal or natural gas and interest rate swaps used to economically hedge against future changes in benchmark interest rates 

for commodity purchase contracts exchangetraded derivative contracts are generally based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets and are classified within level 1 these financial assets and liabilities are secured with cash on deposit with the exchange therefore nonperformance risk has not been incorporated into these valuations certain nonexchangetraded derivatives are valued using broker or overthecounter online exchanges in such cases these nonexchangetraded derivatives are classified within level 2 nonexchangebased derivative instruments may include futures swaps forwards and options in certain instances nisource may utilize models to measure fair value valuation models utilize various inputs that include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active other observable inputs for the asset or liability and marketcorroborated inputs ie inputs derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means where observable inputs are available for substantially the full term of the asset or liability the instrument is categorized in level 2 certain derivatives trade in less active markets with a lower availability of pricing information and models may be utilized in the valuation when such inputs have a significant impact on the measurement of fair value the instrument is categorized in level 3 credit risk is considered in the fair value calculation of derivative instruments that are not exchangetraded credit exposures are adjusted to reflect collateral agreements which reduce exposures 

nisources interest rate swaps are designated as cash flow hedges each period the swap instruments will be measured assuming a hypothetical settlement at that point in time upon termination of the swap instruments nisource will pay or receive a settlement based on the current market value credit risk is considered in the fair value calculation of each interest rate swap as they are based on observable data and valuations of similar instruments the interest rate swaps are categorized in level 2 in the fair value hierarchy 

availableforsale securities are investments pledged as collateral for trust accounts related to nisource’s whollyowned insurance company availableforsale securities are included within “other investments” in the consolidated balance sheets nisource values us treasury corporate and mortgagebacked securities using a matrix pricing model that incorporates marketbased information these securities trade less frequently and are classified within level 2 total unrealized gains and losses from availableforsale securities are included in other comprehensive income loss

other information 

critical accounting policies 

nisource applies certain accounting policies based on the accounting requirements discussed below that have had and may continue to have significant impacts on nisource’s results of operations and consolidated financial statements 

basis of accounting for rateregulated subsidiaries  asc topic 980 regulated operations  provides that rateregulated subsidiaries account for and report assets and liabilities consistent with the economic effect of the way in which regulators establish rates if the rates established are designed to recover the costs of providing the regulated service and if the competitive environment makes it probable that such rates can be charged and collected certain expenses and credits subject to utility regulation or rate determination normally reflected in income are deferred on the consolidated balance sheets and are recognized in income as the related amounts are included in service rates and recovered from or refunded to customers the total amounts of regulatory assets and liabilities reflected on the consolidated balance sheets were 18854 million  and 13818 million  at december 31 2016  and 18067 million  and 15818 million  at december 31 2015  respectively for additional information refer to note 8 “regulatory matters” in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

in the event that regulation significantly changes the opportunity for nisource to recover its costs in the future all or a portion of nisource’s regulated operations may no longer meet the criteria for the application of asc topic 980 regulated operations  in such event a writedown of all or a portion of nisource’s existing regulatory assets and liabilities could result if transition cost recovery is approved by the appropriate regulatory bodies that would meet the requirements under gaap for continued accounting

as regulatory assets and liabilities during such recovery period the regulatory assets and liabilities would be reported at the recoverable amounts if unable to continue to apply the provisions of asc topic 980 regulated operations  nisource would be required to apply the provisions of asc topic 98020 discontinuation of rateregulated accounting  in management’s opinion nisource’s regulated subsidiaries will be subject to asc topic 980 regulated operations  for the foreseeable future 

certain of the regulatory assets reflected on nisource’s consolidated balance sheets require specific regulatory action in order to be included in future service rates although recovery of these amounts is not guaranteed nisource believes that these costs meet the requirements for deferral as regulatory assets regulatory assets requiring specific regulatory action amounted to 3235 million  at december 31 2016  if nisource determined that the amounts included as regulatory assets were not recoverable a charge to income would immediately be required to the extent of the unrecoverable amounts 

pension and postretirement benefits  nisource has defined benefit plans for both pension and other postretirement benefits the calculation of the net obligations and annual expense related to the plans requires a significant degree of judgment regarding the discount rates to be used in bringing the liabilities to present value expected longterm returns on plan assets healthcare trend rates and mortality rates among other assumptions due to the size of the plans and the longterm nature of the associated liabilities changes in the assumptions used in the actuarial estimates could have material impacts on the measurement of the net obligations and annual expense recognition differences between actuarial assumptions and actual plan results are deferred into aoci or a regulatory balance sheet account depending on the jurisdiction of the nisource entity these deferred gains or losses are then amortized into the income statement when the accumulated differences exceed 10 of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or the fair value of plan assets this is known in gaap as the “corridor” method 

the discount rates expected longterm rates of return on plan assets health care cost trend rates and mortality rates are critical assumptions methods used to develop these assumptions are described below while a third party actuarial firm assists with the development of many of these assumptions nisource is ultimately responsible for selecting the final assumptions 

the discount rate is utilized principally in calculating the actuarial present value of pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit plan costs nisource’s discount rates for both pension and other postretirement benefits are determined using an aarated above median yield curve with cash flows matching the expected duration of benefit payments to be made to plan participants 

the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets is a component utilized in calculating annual pension and other postretirement benefit plan costs nisource estimates the expected return on plan assets by evaluating expected bond returns equity risk premiums target asset allocations the effects of active plan management the impact of periodic plan asset rebalancing and historical performance nisource also considers the guidance from its investment advisors in making a final determination of its expected rate of return on assets 

for measurement of 2017 net periodic benefit cost nisource selected an expected pretax longterm rate of return of 725 for its pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets 

nisource estimates the assumed health care cost trend rate which is used in determining our other postretirement benefit net expense based upon our actual health care cost experience the effects of recently enacted legislation thirdparty actuarial surveys and general economic conditions 

nisource has historically utilized the society of actuaries’ most recently published mortality data in developing a best estimate of mortality as part of the calculation of the pension and other postretirement benefit obligations 

item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

n i s ource  i nc  

the following tables illustrate the effects of changes in these actuarial assumptions while holding all other assumptions constant 



beginning january 1 2017 nisource will change the method used to estimate the service and interest components of net periodic benefit cost for pension and other postretirement benefits this change compared to the previous method is expected to result in a decrease in the actuariallydetermined service and interest cost components historically nisource estimated service and interest costs utilizing a single weightedaverage discount rate derived from the yield curve used to measure the benefit obligation at the beginning of the period for fiscal 2017 and beyond nisource elected to utilize a full yield curve approach to estimate these components by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows nisource believes the new approach provides a more precise measurement of service and interest costs by aligning the timing of the plan’s liability cash flows to the corresponding spot rates on the yield curve the benefit obligations measured under this approach are unchanged nisource will account for this change as a change in accounting estimate and accordingly will account for this prospectively for further discussion of nisource’s pension and other postretirement benefits see note 11 “pension and other postretirement benefits” in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

goodwill  nisource’s goodwill assets at december 31 2016  were 16907 million  most of which resulted from the acquisition of columbia on november 1 2000 the separation prompted changes in the way nisource’s chief operating decision maker manages the business where going forward financial accountability is largely at the individual state operating company level this change in management approach triggered an assessment of nisource’s goodwill reporting units through this assessment nisource concluded each of the six state operating companies within the former columbia distribution operations reporting unit are now operating segments nisource further concluded these operating segments represent goodwill reporting units as they do not contain components whose discrete financial information is regularly reviewed by segment management 

goodwill previously allocated to the columbia distribution operations reporting unit was reallocated to the six new reporting units on a relative fair value basis nisource’s remaining reporting unit nipsco gas operations was not impacted by the changes in reporting structure as it was historically and continues to be reviewed by the chief operating decision maker at a state operating company level 

as required by gaap nisource tests for impairment of goodwill on an annual basis and on an interim basis when events or circumstances indicate that a potential impairment may exist nisource’s annual goodwill test takes place in the second quarter of each year and was most recently finalized as of may 1 2016 

nisource completed a quantitative step 1 fair value measurement of its reporting units during the may 1 2016 goodwill test consistent with nisource’s historical impairment testing of goodwill fair value of the reporting units was determined based on a weighting of income and market approaches these approaches require significant judgments including appropriate longterm 

item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

n i s ource  i nc  

growth rates and discount rates for the income approach and appropriate multiples of earnings for peer companies and control premiums for the market approach 

the discount rates were derived using peer company data compiled with the assistance of a third party valuation services firm the discount rates used are subject to change based on changes in tax rates at both the state and federal level debt and equity ratios at each reporting unit and general economic conditions 

the longterm growth rate was derived by evaluating historic growth rates new business and investment opportunities beyond the near term horizon the longterm growth rate is subject to change depending on inflationary impacts to the us economy and the individual business environments in which each reporting unit operates 

the may 1 2016 test indicated the fair value of each of the reporting units that carry or are allocated goodwill exceeded their carrying values indicating that no impairment existed under the step 1 annual impairment test if the estimates of free cash flow used in this step 1 analysis had been 10 lower the resulting fair values would have still been greater than the carrying value for each of the reporting units tested holding all other assumptions constant

nisource inc the company is an energy holding company under the public utility holding company act of 2005 whose subsidiaries are fully regulated natural gas and electric utility companies serving approximately 39 million customers in seven states nisource is the successor to an indiana corporation organized in 1987 under the name of nipsco industries inc which changed its name to nisource on april 14 1999 

nisource is one of the nation’s largest natural gas distribution companies as measured by number of customers nisource’s principal subsidiaries include nisource gas distribution group inc a natural gas distribution holding company and nipsco a gas and electric company nisource derives substantially all of its revenues and earnings from the operating results of these rateregulated businesses 

on july 1 2015 nisource completed the separation of cpg from nisource cpgs operations consisted of all of nisources columbia pipeline group operations segment prior to the separation following the separation nisource retained no ownership interest in cpg 

the results of operations and cash flows for the former columbia pipeline group operations segment have been reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented additionally the assets and liabilities of the former columbia pipeline group operations segment were reclassified as assets and liabilities of discontinued operations for all prior periods see note 3 discontinued operations in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 

nisource’s reportable segments are gas distribution operations and electric operations the following is a summary of the business for each reporting segment refer to item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and note 22 segments of business in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information for each segment 

gas distribution operations 

nisource’s natural gas distribution operations serve approximately 34 million customers in seven states and operate approximately 59000 miles of pipeline through its whollyowned subsidiary nisource gas distribution group inc nisource owns six distribution subsidiaries that provide natural gas to approximately 26 million residential commercial and industrial customers in ohio pennsylvania virginia kentucky maryland and massachusetts additionally nisource also distributes natural gas to approximately 812000 customers in northern indiana through its whollyowned subsidiary nipsco

n i s ource  i nc  

nisource’s goal is to develop strategies that benefit all stakeholders as it addresses changing customer conservation patterns develops more contemporary pricing structures and embarks on longterm investment programs these strategies will help improve reliability and safety enhance customer services and reduce emissions while generating sustainable returns 

competition and changes in the regulatory environment 

the regulatory frameworks applicable to nisource’s operations at both the state and federal levels continue to evolve these changes have had and will continue to have an impact on nisource’s operations structure and profitability management continually seeks new ways to be more competitive and profitable in this environment including providing gas customers with increased choices for products and services 

natural gas competition  open access to natural gas supplies over interstate pipelines and the deregulation of the commodity price of gas has led to tremendous change in the energy markets ldc customers and marketers can purchase gas directly from producers and marketers as an open competitive market for gas supplies has emerged this separation or “unbundling” of the transportation and other services offered by pipelines and ldcs allows customers to purchase the commodity independent of services provided by the pipelines and ldcs the ldcs continue to purchase gas and recover the associated costs from their customers nisource’s gas distribution operations’ subsidiaries are involved in programs that provide customers the opportunity to purchase their natural gas requirements from third parties and use the nisource gas distribution operations’ subsidiaries for transportation services 

electric competition  indiana electric utilities generally have exclusive service areas under indiana regulations and retail electric customers in indiana do not have the ability to choose their electric supplier nipsco faces nonutility competition from other energy sources such as selfgeneration by large industrial customers and other distributed energy sources

 item 1a risk factors 

n i s ource  i nc  

nisource’s operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties including those described below that could adversely affect the company’s business financial condition results of operations cash flows and the trading price of the company’s common stock 

nisource has substantial indebtedness which could adversely affect its financial condition 

nisource had total consolidated indebtedness of 69496 million  outstanding as of december 31 2015 the company’s substantial indebtedness could have important consequences for example it could 

 some of nisource’s debt obligations contain financial covenants related to debttocapital ratios and crossdefault provisions nisource’s failure to comply with any of these covenants could result in an event of default which if not cured or waived could result in the acceleration of outstanding debt obligations 

a drop in nisource’s credit rating could adversely impact nisource’s liquidity   

the credit rating agencies periodically review the company’s ratings taking into account factors such as our capital structure and earnings profile in 2015 moody’s affirmed the nisource senior unsecured rating of baa2 and its commercial paper rating of p2 with stable outlooks moody’s also affirmed nipsco’s baa1 rating and columbia gas of massachusetts’s baa2 rating with stable outlooks in 2015 standard  poor’s raised the senior unsecured ratings of nisource and its subsidiaries to bbb and nisource’s commercial paper rating to a2 with stable outlooks in 2015 fitch affirmed the nisource senior unsecured rating of bbb commercial paper rating of f3 and the existing ratings of its other rated subsidiaries fitch revised its outlook to positive 

the company is committed to maintaining investment grade credit ratings however there is no assurance we will be able to do so in the future the company’s credit ratings could be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if in its judgment the circumstances warrant any negative rating action could adversely affect our ability to access capital at rates and on terms that are attractive a negative rating action could also adversely impact our business relationships with suppliers and operating partners 

certain nisource subsidiaries have agreements that contain “ratings triggers” that require increased collateral if the credit ratings of nisource or certain of its subsidiaries are below investment grade these agreements are primarily for insurance purposes and for the physical purchase or sale of power as of december 31 2015 the collateral requirement that would be required in the event of a downgrade below the ratings trigger levels would amount to approximately 269 million  in addition to agreements with ratings triggers there are other agreements that contain “adequate assurance” or “material adverse change” provisions that could necessitate additional credit support such as letters of credit and cash collateral to transact business 

nisource may not be able to execute its business plan or growth strategy including utility infrastructure investments 

business or regulatory conditions may result in nisource not being able to execute its business plan or growth strategy including identified planned and other utility infrastructure investments nisource’s customer and regulatory initiatives may not achieve planned results utility infrastructure investments may not materialize may cease to be achievable or economically viable and may not be successfully completed natural gas may cease to be viewed as an economically and ecologically attractive fuel any of these developments could adversely affect our results of operations and growth prospects 

item 1a risk factors 

n i s ource  i nc  

adverse economic and market conditions or increases in interest rates could reduce net revenue growth increase costs decrease future net income and cash flows and impact capital resources and liquidity needs 

while the national economy is experiencing modest growth nisource cannot predict how robust future growth will be or whether or not it will be sustained deteriorating or sluggish economic conditions in nisource’s operating jurisdictions could adversely impact nisource’s ability to grow its customer base and collect revenues from customers which could reduce net revenue growth and increase operating costs 

the company relies on access to the capital markets to finance our liquidity and longterm capital requirements market turmoil could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital or refinance debt at reasonable borrowing costs and terms reduced access to capital markets andor increased borrowing costs could reduce future net income and cash flows refer to note 14 “longterm debt” in the notes to consolidated financial statements for information related to outstanding longterm debt and maturities of that debt 

capital market performance and other factors may decrease the value of benefit plan assets which then could require significant additional funding and impact earnings 

the performance of the capital markets affects the value of the assets that are held in trust to satisfy future obligations under defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans nisource has significant obligations in these areas and holds significant assets in these trusts these assets are subject to market fluctuations and may yield uncertain returns which fall below nisource’s projected rates of return a decline in the market value of assets may increase the funding requirements of the obligations under the defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans additionally changes in interest rates affect the liabilities under these benefit plans as interest rates decrease the liabilities increase which could potentially increase funding requirements further the funding requirements of the obligations related to these benefits plans may increase due to changes in governmental regulations and participant demographics including increased numbers of retirements or changes in life expectancy assumptions ultimately significant funding requirements and increased pension or other postretirement benefit plan expense could negatively impact nisource’s results of operations and financial position 

the majority of nisource’s net revenues are subject to economic regulation and are exposed to the impact of regulatory rate reviews and proceedings 

most of nisource’s net revenues are subject to economic regulation at either the federal or state level as such the net revenues generated by those regulated companies are subject to regulatory review by the applicable federal or state authority these rate reviews determine the rates charged to customers and directly impact revenues nisource’s financial results are dependent on frequent regulatory proceedings in order to ensure timely recovery of costs additionally the costs of complying with future changes in environmental laws and regulations are expected to be significant and their recovery through rates will be contingent on regulatory approval 

as a result of efforts to introduce marketbased competition in certain markets where the regulated businesses conduct operations nisource may compete with independent marketers for customers this competition exposes nisource to the risk that certain stranded costs may not be recoverable and may affect results of nisource’s growth strategy and financial position 

nisource’s costs of compliance with environmental laws are significant the costs of compliance with future environmental laws and the costs associated with environmental liabilities could impact cash flow and profitability 

nisource is subject to extensive federal state and local environmental requirements that among other things regulate air emissions water usage and discharges remediation and the management of chemicals hazardous waste solid waste and coal combustion residuals compliance with these legal obligations requires nisource to make expenditures for installation of pollution control equipment remediation environmental monitoring emissions fees and permits at many of nisource’s facilities these expenditures are significant and nisource expects that they will continue to be significant in the future furthermore if nisource fails to comply with environmental laws and regulations or is found to have caused damage to the environment or persons even if caused by factors beyond nisource’s control that failure or harm may result in the assessment of civil or criminal penalties and damages against nisource 

existing environmental laws and regulations may be revised and new laws and regulations seeking to increase environmental regulation of the energy industry may be adopted or become applicable to nisource revised or additional laws and regulations could result in significant additional expense and operating restrictions on nisource’s facilities or increased compliance costs 

item 1a risk factors 

n i s ource  i nc  

which may not be fully recoverable from customers and would therefore reduce net income moreover such costs could materially affect the continued economic viability of one or more of nisource’s facilities 

even in instances where legal and regulatory requirements are already known or anticipated the original cost estimates for cleanup and environmental capital projects can differ materially from the amount ultimately expended the actual future expenditures depend on many factors including the nature and extent of impact the method of cleanup the cost of raw materials contractor costs and the availability of cost recovery changes in costs and the ability to recover under regulatory mechanisms could affect nisource’s financial position operating results and cash flows because nisource operates fossil fuel facilities emissions of ghgs are an expected aspect of the business while nisource continues to reduce ghg emissions through efficiency programs leak detection and other programs ghg emissions cannot be eliminated the epa has made clear that it is focused on reducing ghg emissions from the energy industry on october 18 2015 the epa finalized its cpp which regulates greenhouse gas emissions from coal and natural gas electric generating units the cpp is subject to various legal challenges but if the cpp survives these challenges the compliance costs associated with cpp requirements could impact cash flow in addition the cpp could increase nisource’s cost of producing energy which may impact customer demand andor nisource’s profitability the cpp requires states or in some cases the epa to develop individualized plans to meet the cpp emission reduction requirements depending on the array of programs chosen by the state of indiana or epa nisource’s cpp compliance costs could be substantial it is also possible that additional future ghg legislation andor regulation could materially impact nisource the cost impact of any new andor amended ghg legislation or regulations would depend upon the specific requirements enacted and cannot be determined at this time 

a significant portion of the gas and electricity nisource sells is used by residential and commercial customers for heating and air conditioning accordingly fluctuations in weather gas and electricity commodity costs and economic conditions impact demand of our customers and our operating results 

energy sales are sensitive to variations in weather forecasts of energy sales are based on normal weather which represents a longterm historical average significant variations from normal weather could have and have had a material impact on energy sales additionally residential usage and to some degree commercial usage is sensitive to fluctuations in commodity costs for gas and electricity whereby usage declines with increased costs thus affecting nisource’s financial results lastly residential and commercial customers’ usage is sensitive to economic conditions and factors such as unemployment consumption and consumer confidence therefore prevailing economic conditions may affect nisource’s financial results 

nisource’s business operations are subject to economic conditions in certain industries 

business operations throughout nisource’s service territories have been and may continue to be adversely affected by economic events at the national and local level where it operates in particular sales to large industrial customers such as those in the steel oil refining industrial gas and related industries may be impacted by economic downturns the us manufacturing industry continues to adjust to changing market conditions including international competition increasing costs and fluctuating demand for its products 

fluctuations in the price of energy commodities or their related transportation costs may have a negative impact on nisource’s financial results 

nisource’s electric generating fleet is dependent on coal and natural gas for fuel and its gas distribution operations purchase and resell much of the natural gas they deliver these energy commodities are vulnerable to price fluctuations and fluctuations in associated transportation costs from time to time nisource has used hedging in order to offset fluctuations in commodity supply prices nisource relies on regulatory recovery mechanisms in the various jurisdictions in order to fully recover the commodity costs incurred in operations however while nisource has historically been successful in recovery of costs related to such commodity prices there can be no assurance that such costs will be fully recovered through rates in a timely manner 

nisource is exposed to risk that customers will not remit payment for delivered energy or services and that suppliers or counterparties will not perform under various financial or operating agreements 

nisource’s extension of credit is governed by a corporate credit risk policy involves considerable judgment and is based on an evaluation of a customer or counterparty’s financial condition credit history and other factors nisource monitors its credit risk exposure   by obtaining credit reports and updated financial information for customers and suppliers and by evaluating the financial status of its banking partners and other counterparties by reference to marketbased metrics such as credit default swap pricing 

item 1a risk factors 

n i s ource  i nc  

levels and to traditional credit ratings provided by the major credit rating agencies adverse economic conditions could result in an increase in defaults by customers suppliers and counterparties 

nisource has significant goodwill and definitelived intangible assets an impairment of goodwill or definitelived intangible assets could result in a significant charge to earnings and negatively impact nisources compliance with certain covenants under financing agreements 

in accordance with gaap nisource tests goodwill for impairment at least annually and reviews its definitelived intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable goodwill also is tested for impairment when factors examples of which include reduced cash flow estimates a sustained decline in stock price or market capitalization below book value indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable nisource would be required to record a charge in its financial statements for the period in which any impairment of the goodwill or definitelived intangible assets is determined negatively impacting the results of operations a significant charge could impact the capitalization ratio covenant under certain financing agreements nisource is subject to a financial covenant under its fiveyear revolving credit facility which requires nisource to maintain a debt to capitalization ratio that does not exceed 70 a similar covenant in a 2005 private placement note purchase agreement requires nisource to maintain a debt to capitalization ratio that does not exceed 75 as of december 31 2015 the ratio was 64  

changes in taxation and the ability to quantify such changes could adversely affect nisource’s financial results 

nisource is subject to taxation by the various taxing authorities at the federal state and local levels where it does business legislation or regulation which could affect nisource’s tax burden could be enacted by any of these governmental authorities nisource cannot predict the timing or extent of such taxrelated developments which could have a negative impact on the financial results additionally nisource uses its best judgment in attempting to quantify and reserve for these tax obligations however a challenge by a taxing authority nisource’s ability to utilize tax benefits such as carryforwards or tax credits or a deviation from other taxrelated assumptions may cause actual financial results to deviate from previous estimates 

changes in accounting principles may adversely affect nisource’s financial results 

future changes in accounting rules and associated changes in regulatory accounting may negatively impact the way nisource records revenues expenses assets and liabilities these changes in accounting standards may adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations 

distribution of natural gas and the generation transmission and distribution of electricity involve numerous risks that may result in incidents and other operating risks and costs 

nisources gas distribution and transmission activities as well as generation transmission and distribution of electricity involve a variety of inherent hazards and operating risks such as gas leaks downed power lines incidents including thirdparty damages large scale outages and mechanical problems which could cause substantial financial losses in addition these risks could result in serious injury or loss of life to employees and the general public significant damage to property environmental pollution impairment of its operations adverse regulatory rulings and reputational harm which in turn could lead to substantial losses to nisource the location of pipeline facilities or generation transmission substation and distribution facilities near populated areas including residential areas commercial business centers and industrial sites could increase the level of damages resulting from such events the occurrence of such events could adversely affect nisources financial position and results of operations in accordance with customary industry practice nisource maintains insurance against some but not all of these risks and losses 

aging infrastructure may lead to disruptions in operations and increased capital expenditures and maintenance costs all of which could negatively impact nisource’s financial results 

nisource has risks associated with aging infrastructure assets the age of these assets may result in a need for replacement a higher level of maintenance costs and unscheduled outages despite efforts by nisource to properly maintain these assets through inspection scheduled maintenance and capital investment the failure to operate these assets as desired could result in incidents and in nisource’s inability to meet firm service obligations adversely impacting revenues and could also result in increased capital expenditures and maintenance costs which if not fully recovered from customers could negatively impact nisources financial results

the impacts of climate change natural disasters acts of terrorism or other catastrophic events may disrupt operations and reduce the ability to service customers 

a disruption or failure of natural gas distribution systems or within electric generation transmission or distribution systems in the event of a major hurricane tornado terrorist attack or other catastrophic event could cause delays in completing sales providing services or performing other critical functions nisource has experienced disruptions in the past from hurricanes and tornadoes and other events of this nature the occurrence of such events could adversely affect nisources financial position and results of operations in accordance with customary industry practice nisource maintains insurance against some but not all of these risks and losses there is also a concern that climate change may exacerbate the risks to physical infrastructure such risks include heat stresses to power lines storms that damage infrastructure lake and sea level changes that damage the manner in which services are currently provided droughts or other stresses on water used to supply services and other extreme weather conditions climate change and the costs that may be associated with its impacts have the potential to affect nisource’s business in many ways including increasing the cost nisource incurs in providing its products and services impacting the demand for and consumption of its products and services due to change in both costs and weather patterns and affecting the economic health of the regions in which nisource operates 

a cyberattack on any of nisources or certain thirdparty computer systems upon which nisource relies may adversely affect its ability to operate 

nisource is reliant on technology to run its businesses which are dependent upon financial and operational computer systems to process critical information necessary to conduct various elements of its business including the generation transmission and distribution of electricity operation of its gas pipeline facilities and the recording and reporting of commercial and financial transactions to regulators investors and other stakeholders any failure of nisource’s computer systems or those of its customers suppliers or others with whom it does business could materially disrupt nisource’s ability to operate its business and could result in a financial loss and possibly do harm to nisource’s reputation 

additionally nisources information systems experience ongoing often sophisticated cyberattacks by a variety of sources with the apparent aim to breach nisources cyberdefenses although nisource attempts to maintain adequate defenses to these attacks and works through industry groups and trade associations to identify common threats and assess nisources countermeasures a security breach of nisources information systems could i impact the reliability of nisources generation transmission and distribution systems and potentially negatively impact nisources compliance with certain mandatory reliability standards ii subject nisource to harm associated with theft or inappropriate release of certain types of information such as system operating information or information personal or otherwise relating to nisources customers or employees andor iii impact nisources ability to manage nisources businesses 

nisources capital projects and programs subject the company to construction risks and natural gas costs and supply risks 

nisource is engaged in an intrastate natural gas pipeline modernization program to maintain system integrity and enhance service reliability and flexibility nipsco also is currently engaged in a number of capital projects including environmental improvements to its electric generating stations as well as the construction of new transmission facilities as nisource undertakes these projects and programs it may not be able to complete them on schedule or at the anticipated costs additionally nisource may construct or purchase some of these projects and programs to capture anticipated future growth in natural gas production which may not materialize and may cause the construction to occur over an extended period of time nisource also may not receive material increases in revenue and cash flows until after the completion of the projects and programs 

sustained extreme weather conditions may negatively impact nisource’s operations 

nisource conducts its operations across a wide geographic area subject to varied and potentially extreme weather conditions which may from time to time persist for sustained periods of time despite preventative maintenance efforts persistent weather related stress on nisource’s infrastructure may reveal weaknesses in its systems not previously known to the company or otherwise present various operational challenges across all business segments further adverse weather may affect nisource’s ability to conduct operations in a manner that satisfies customer expectations or contractual obligations including by causing service disruptions 

item 1a risk factors 

n i s ource  i nc  

nisource is a holding company and is dependent on cash generated by subsidiaries to meet its debt obligations and pay dividends on its common stock 

nisource is a holding company and conducts its operations primarily through its subsidiaries substantially all of nisource’s consolidated assets are held by its subsidiaries accordingly nisource’s ability to meet its debt obligations or pay dividends on its common stock is largely dependent upon cash generated by these subsidiaries in the event a major subsidiary is not able to pay dividends or transfer cash flows to nisource nisources ability to service its debt obligations or pay dividends could be negatively affected 

following the separation all of the entities formerly included in nisources columbia pipeline group operations segment have been separated from nisource and are held by a separate publicly traded company cpg the related assets are no longer held by subsidiaries of nisource which may negatively affect nisources ability to service its debt obligations or pay dividends 

the separation may not achieve the intended benefits and may result in significant tax liabilities 

nisource cannot predict with certainty when the benefits expected from the separation will occur or the extent to which they will be achieved if at all furthermore there are various uncertainties and risks relating to the process of the separation that could have a negative impact on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows including disruption of our operations and impairment of our relationship with regulators key personnel customers and vendors as a result of the completion of the separation nisource faces new and unique risks including having fewer assets reduced financial resources and less diversification of revenue sources 

the separation was conditioned on the receipt by nisource of a legal opinion to the effect that the distribution of cpg shares to nisource stockholders is expected to qualify as taxfree under section 355 of the us internal revenue code even though nisource has received such an opinion the irs could determine on audit that the distribution is taxable both nisource and its stockholders could incur significant us federal income tax liabilities if taxing authorities conclude the distribution is taxable

consolidated review 

executive summary 

nisource is an energy holding company under the public utility holding company act of 2005 whose subsidiaries are fully regulated natural gas and electric utility companies serving customers in seven states nisource generates substantially all of its operating income through these rateregulated businesses a significant portion of nisource’s operations is subject to seasonal fluctuations in sales during the heating season which is primarily from november through march net revenues from gas sales are more significant and during the cooling season which is primarily from june through september net revenues from electric sales are more significant than in other months 

nisource reported lower income from continuing operations of 1986 million or 063 per basic share for the twelve months ended december 31 2015 compared to 2562 million or 081 per basic share for the same period in 2014 the lower income 

item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

n i s ource  i nc  

from continuing operations during 2015 was due primarily to a 972 million loss on early extinguishment of longterm debt recorded as a result of the debt restructuring that occurred in 2015 as part of the separation 

for the twelve months ended december 31 2015 nisource reported operating income of 7999 million compared to 7891 million for the same period in 2014 the slightly higher operating income was primarily due to increased net revenues from gas distribution regulatory and service programs increased return on environmental capital investment at nipsco partially offset by lower net revenues due to warmer than normal weather and lower industrial customer usage operating expenses were higher due to increased employee and administrative expenses higher environmental remediation costs and increased depreciation expense 

as part of our longterm regulated infrastructure investment program nisource invested 13675 million in 2015 across our gas and electric utilities nisource expects to invest an additional 13916 million during 2016 

nisource believes that through income generated from operating activities amounts available under its shortterm revolving credit facility commercial paper program accounts receivable securitization facilities longterm debt agreements and nisource’s ability to access the capital markets there is adequate capital available to fund its operating activities and capital expenditures in 2016 at december 31 2015 nisource had approximately 11794 million of liquidity available consisting of cash and available capacity under credit facilities 

these factors and other impacts to the financial results are discussed in more detail within the following discussions of “results of operations” and “results and discussion of segment operations”

results of operations 

income from continuing operations 

for the year ended december 31 2015  nisource reported income from continuing operations of 1986 million  or 063  per basic share compared to 2562 million  or 081  per basic share in 2014  income from continuing operations for the year ended december 31 2013  was 2210 million  or 071  per basic share 

comparability of line item operating results is impacted by regulatory and tax trackers that allow for the recovery in rates of certain costs such as bad debt expense therefore increases in these tracked operating expenses are offset by increases in net revenues and have essentially no impact on income from continuing operations 

net revenues 

nisource analyzes its operating results using net revenues net revenues are calculated as revenues less the associated cost of sales excluding depreciation and amortization nisource believes net revenues are a better measure to analyze profitability than gross operating revenues since the majority of the cost of sales are tracked costs that are passed through directly to the customer resulting in an equal and offsetting amount reflected in gross operating revenues 

item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

n i s ource  i nc  

total consolidated net revenues for the year ended december 31 2015  were 30081 million  a 1086 million increase compared with 2014  net revenues increased primarily due to increased gas distribution operations net revenues of 824 million and higher electric operations net revenues of 223 million

 operating expenses 

operating expenses were 22082 million  in 2015  an increase of 978 million from the comparable 2014  period this increase was primarily due to higher operation and maintenance expenses of 588 million and increased depreciation and amortization of 375 million the increase in operation and maintenance expenses was primarily due to increased regulatory trackers which are offset in net revenues of 193 million higher employee and administrative expenses of 145 million increased environmental costs of 143 million and higher electric generation costs of 60 million the increase in depreciation and amortization is primarily due to higher capital expenditures placed in service in 2015 

operating expenses were 21104 million  in 2014  an increase of 1461 million from the comparable 2013  period this increase was primarily due to higher operation and maintenance expenses of 1129 million increased depreciation and amortization of 165 million and higher other taxes of 148 million the increase in operation and maintenance expenses was primarily due to increased regulatory trackers which are offset in net revenues of 403 million higher employee and administrative expenses of 342 million increased outside services of 172 million higher electric generation costs of 152 million as a result of maintenance related outages and increased uncollectibles of 63 million the increase in depreciation and amortization is primarily due to higher capital expenditures related to projects placed in service in 2014 the increase in other taxes is primarily attributable to tax trackers which are offset in net revenues of 92 million 

other income deductions 

other income deductions in 2015  reduced income 4600 million  compared to a reduction of 3661 million  in 2014  the increase in deductions is primarily due to a loss on early extinguishment of longterm debt of 972 million refer to note 14 longterm debt in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information on longterm debt retired in may 2015

liquidity and capital resources 

a significant portion of nisource’s operations are subject to seasonal fluctuations in cash flow during the heating season which is primarily from november through march cash receipts from gas sales and transportation services typically exceed cash requirements during the summer months cash on hand together with the seasonal increase in cash flows from the electric business during the summer cooling season and external shortterm and longterm financing is used to purchase gas to place in storage for heating season deliveries and perform necessary maintenance of facilities nisource believes that through income generated from operating activities amounts available under its shortterm revolving credit facility commercial paper program accounts receivable securitization programs longterm debt agreements and nisource’s ability to access the capital markets there is adequate capital available to fund its operating activities and capital expenditures in 2016

net cash from operating activities from continuing operations for the year ended december 31 2015  was 11634 million  an increase  of 4022 million  from 2014 the increase in net cash from operating activities from continuing operations was primarily due to the change in regulatory assetsliabilities as well as the change in inventories and overrecovered gas and fuel costs working capital accounts as a result of lower gas prices and warmer weather in 2015 compared to 2014 

net cash from operating activities from continuing operations for the year ended december 31 2014  was 7612 million  a decrease of 2066 million  from the prior year the decrease in net cash from operating activities from continuing operations was primarily attributable to an income tax refund received in 2013 

pension and other postretirement plan funding  in 2015  nisource contributed 27 million  to its pension plans and 258 million  to its postretirement medical and life plans in 2016  nisource expects to make contributions of approximately 30 million  to its pension plans and approximately 222 million  to its postretirement medical and life plans at december 31 2015  nisource’s pension and other postretirement benefit plans were underfunded by 4596 million  and 2999 million  respectively

1  amounts differ from those presented on the statements of consolidated cash flows primarily due to the inclusion of capital expenditures included in current liabilities and afudc equity 

for 2016  the projected capital program and certain other investing activities are expected to be 13916 million  which is 241 million higher than the 2015  capital program this increased spending is mainly due to identified gas distribution operations segment growth and betterment projects in 2016 

item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

n i s ource  i nc  

for 2015  the capital expenditures and certain other investing activities were 13675 million  which is 279 million higher than the 2014  capital program this increased spending is mainly due to increased tdsic spend in the gas distribution operations segment partially offset by lower tracker program spend at the electric operations segment 

for 2014  capital expenditures and certain other investing activities were 13396 million  an increase of 911 million compared to 2013  this increased spending is mainly due to continued spending on infrastructure replacement programs in the gas distribution operations segment 

restricted cash was 297 million  and 249 million  as of december 31 2015  and 2014  respectively the increase in restricted cash was primarily a result of higher margin requirements due to open derivative contracts

risk is an inherent part of nisource’s energy businesses the extent to which nisource properly and effectively identifies assesses monitors and manages each of the various types of risk involved in its businesses is critical to its profitability nisource seeks to identify assess monitor and manage in accordance with defined policies and procedures the following principal market risks that are involved in nisource’s energy businesses commodity price risk interest rate risk and credit risk risk management at nisource is a multifaceted process with oversight by the risk management committee that requires constant communication judgment and knowledge of specialized products and markets nisource’s senior management takes an active role in the risk management process and has developed policies and procedures that require specific administrative and business functions to assist in the identification assessment and control of various risks these include but are not limited to market operational financial compliance and strategic risk types in recognition of the increasingly varied and complex nature of the energy business nisource’s risk management process policies and procedures continue to evolve and are subject to ongoing review and modification 

  

commodity price risk 

nisource is exposed to commodity price risk as a result of its subsidiaries’ operations involving natural gas and power to manage this market risk nisource’s subsidiaries use derivatives including commodity futures contracts swaps and options nisource is not involved in speculative energy trading activity 

commodity price risk resulting from derivative activities at nisource’s rateregulated subsidiaries is limited since regulations allow recovery of prudently incurred purchased power fuel and gas costs through the ratemaking process including gains or losses on these derivative instruments if states should explore additional regulatory reform these subsidiaries may begin providing services without the benefit of the traditional ratemaking process and may be more exposed to commodity price risk some of nisource’s rateregulated utility subsidiaries offer commodity price risk products to its customers for which derivatives are used to hedge forecasted customer usage under such products these subsidiaries do not have regulatory recovery orders for these products and are subject to gains and losses recognized in earnings due to hedge ineffectiveness 

nisource subsidiaries are required to make cash margin deposits with their brokers to cover actual and potential losses in the value of outstanding exchange traded derivative contracts the amount of these deposits which are reflected in nisource’s restricted cash balance may fluctuate significantly during periods of high volatility in the energy commodity markets 

there are no material commodity price risk assets or liabilities as of december 31 2015  and 2014  

interest rate risk 

nisource is exposed to interest rate risk as a result of changes in interest rates on borrowings under its revolving credit agreement commercial paper program and accounts receivable programs which have interest rates that are indexed to shortterm market interest rates nisource manages interest rate risk by entering into forward starting interestrate swaps that hedge the interest rate risk related to forecasted issuances of longtermdebt based upon average borrowings and debt obligations subject to fluctuations in shortterm market interest rates an increase or decrease in shortterm interest rates of 100 basis points 1 would have increased or decreased interest expense by 82 million  and 200 million  for the years 2015  and 2014  respectively 

item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

n i s ource  i nc  

in december 2015 nisource finance entered into two forward starting interestrate swaps each hedging the interest rate risk on coupon payments arising from 500 million of forecasted issuances of longterm debt in each of 2017 and 2018 refer to note 14 longterm debt in the notes to consolidated financial statements for futher information on nisources forward starting interestrate swaps 

  

credit risk 

due to the nature of the industry credit risk is embedded in many of nisource’s business activities nisource’s extension of credit is governed by a corporate credit risk policy in addition risk management committee guidelines are in place which document management approval levels for credit limits evaluation of creditworthiness and credit risk mitigation efforts exposures to credit risks are monitored by the risk management function which is independent of commercial operations credit risk arises due to the possibility that a customer supplier or counterparty will not be able or willing to fulfill its obligations on a transaction on or before the settlement date for derivative related contracts credit risk arises when counterparties are obligated to deliver or purchase defined commodity units of gas or power to nisource at a future date per execution of contractual terms and conditions exposure to credit risk is measured in terms of both current obligations and the market value of forward positions net of any posted collateral such as cash and letters of credit 

nisource closely monitors the financial status of its banking credit providers nisource evaluates the financial status of its banking partners through the use of marketbased metrics such as credit default swap pricing levels and also through traditional credit ratings provided by major credit rating agencies 

fair value measurement 

nisource measures certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value the level of the fair value hierarchy disclosed is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement nisource’s financial assets and liabilities include price risk assets and liabilities availableforsale securities and a deferred compensation plan obligation 

exchangetraded derivative contracts are generally based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets and are classified within level 1 these financial assets and liabilities are secured with cash on deposit with the exchange therefore nonperformance risk has not been incorporated into these valuations certain nonexchangetraded derivatives are valued using broker or overthecounter online exchanges in such cases these nonexchangetraded derivatives are classified within level 2 nonexchangebased derivative instruments include swaps forwards and options in certain instances nisource may utilize models to measure fair value valuation models utilize various inputs that include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active other observable inputs for the asset or liability and marketcorroborated inputs ie inputs derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means where observable inputs are available for substantially the full term of the asset or liability the instrument is categorized in level 2 certain derivatives trade in less active markets with a lower availability of pricing information and models may be utilized in the valuation when such inputs have a significant impact on the measurement of fair value the instrument is categorized in level 3 credit risk is considered in the fair value calculation of derivative instruments that are not exchangetraded credit exposures are adjusted to reflect collateral agreements which reduce exposures 

price risk management liabilities also include forward starting interestrate swaps which are designated as cash flow hedges each period the swap instrument will be measured assuming a hypothetical settlement at that point in time upon termination of the swap instruments nisource will pay or receive a settlement based on the current market value credit risk is considered in the fair value calculation of each interestrate swap as they are based on observable data and valuations of similar instruments the interestrate swaps are categorized in level 2 in the fair value hierarchy

other information 

critical accounting policies 

nisource applies certain accounting policies based on the accounting requirements discussed below that have had and may continue to have significant impacts on nisource’s results of operations and consolidated financial statements 

basis of accounting for rateregulated subsidiaries  asc topic 980 regulated operations  provides that rateregulated subsidiaries account for and report assets and liabilities consistent with the economic effect of the way in which regulators establish 

item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

n i s ource  i nc  

rates if the rates established are designed to recover the costs of providing the regulated service and if the competitive environment makes it probable that such rates can be charged and collected certain expenses and credits subject to utility regulation or rate determination normally reflected in income are deferred on the consolidated balance sheets and are recognized in income as the related amounts are included in service rates and recovered from or refunded to customers the total amounts of regulatory assets and liabilities reflected on the consolidated balance sheets were 17719 million  and 14337 million  at december 31 2015  and 17319 million  and 14407 million  at december 31 2014  respectively for additional information refer to note 7 “regulatory matters” in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

in the event that regulation significantly changes the opportunity for nisource to recover its costs in the future all or a portion of nisource’s regulated operations may no longer meet the criteria for the application of asc topic 980 regulated operations  in such event a writedown of all or a portion of nisource’s existing regulatory assets and liabilities could result if transition cost recovery is approved by the appropriate regulatory bodies that would meet the requirements under gaap for continued accounting as regulatory assets and liabilities during such recovery period the regulatory assets and liabilities would be reported at the recoverable amounts if unable to continue to apply the provisions of asc topic 980 regulated operations  nisource would be required to apply the provisions of asc topic 98020 discontinuation of rateregulated accounting  in management’s opinion nisource’s regulated subsidiaries will be subject to asc topic 980 regulated operations  for the foreseeable future 

certain of the regulatory assets reflected on nisource’s consolidated balance sheets require specific regulatory action in order to be included in future service rates although recovery of these amounts is not guaranteed nisource believes that these costs meet the requirements for deferral as regulatory assets regulatory assets requiring specific regulatory action amounted to 2627 million  at december 31 2015  if nisource determined that the amounts included as regulatory assets were not recoverable a charge to income would immediately be required to the extent of the unrecoverable amounts 

pensions and postretirement benefits  nisource has defined benefit plans for both pensions and other postretirement benefits the calculation of the net obligations and annual expense related to the plans requires a significant degree of judgment regarding the discount rates to be used in bringing the liabilities to present value longterm returns on plan assets and employee longevity among other assumptions due to the size of the plans and the longterm nature of the associated liabilities changes in the assumptions used in the actuarial estimates could have material impacts on the measurement of the net obligations and annual expense recognition for further discussion of nisource’s pensions and other postretirement benefits see note 10 “pension and other postretirement benefits” in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

goodwill  nisource’s goodwill assets at december 31 2015  were 16907 million  most of which resulted from the acquisition of columbia on november 1 2000 as required nisource tests for impairment of goodwill on an annual basis and on an interim basis when events or circumstances indicate that a potential impairment may exist nisource’s annual goodwill test takes place in the second quarter of each year and was most recently finalized as of may 1 2015 

nisource completed a quantitative step 1 fair value measurement of its reporting units during the may 1 2012 goodwill test that test indicated the fair value of each of the reporting units that carry or are allocated goodwill substantially exceeded their carrying values indicating that no impairment existed under the step 1 annual impairment test a qualitative step 0 test was performed as of may 1 2015 and 2014 nisource assessed various assumptions events and circumstances that would have affected the estimated fair value of the reporting units in its baseline may 1 2012 test the results of this assessment indicated that it is not more likely than not that its reporting unit fair values are less than the reporting unit carrying values and no impairments are necessary 

the separation prompted changes in the way nisource’s chief operating decision maker manages the business where going forward financial accountability is largely at the individual state operating company level this change in management approach triggered an assessment of nisource’s goodwill reporting units through this assessment nisource concluded each of the six state operating companies within the former columbia distribution operations reporting unit are now operating segments nisource further concluded these operating segments represent goodwill reporting units as they do not contain components whose discrete financial information is regularly reviewed by segment management 

goodwill previously allocated to the columbia distribution operations reporting unit was reallocated to the six new reporting units on a relative fair value basis in accordance with gaap and consistent with nisource’s historical impairment testing of goodwill fair value was determined based on a weighting of income and market approaches the resulting fair values were substantially in excess of their respective reporting unit’s carrying values nisource’s remaining reporting unit nipsco gas

gas distribution operations 



competition 

gas distribution operations competes with investorowned municipal and cooperative electric utilities throughout its service areas as well as other regulated and unregulated natural gas intra and interstate pipelines and other alternate fuels such as propane and fuel oil gas distribution operations continues to be a strong competitor in the energy market as a result of strong customer preference for natural gas competition with providers of electricity has traditionally been the strongest in the residential and commercial markets of kentucky southern ohio central pennsylvania and western virginia due to comparatively low electric rates natural gas competes with fuel oil and propane in the massachusetts market mainly due to the installed base of fuel oil and propanebased heating which has comprised a declining percentage of the overall market over the last few years however fuel oil and propane are more viable in today’s depressed oil market

market conditions 

spot prices at the henry hub for the winter through december 2015 have primarily been in the 154 to 240 per dth range compared to the price range of 275 to 428 per dth experienced during the winter through december 2014 

entering the 2015  2016 winter season national storage levels were 371 bcf above the prior year and 147 bcf above the five year average inventory level based on october 30 2015 energy information administration storage report during the summer of 2015 prices ranged between 208 and 307 per dth averaging below the range of 352 to 480 per dth experienced during the summer of 2014 

all nisource gas distribution operations companies have stateapproved recovery mechanisms that provide a means for full recovery of prudently incurred gas costs gas costs are treated as passthrough costs and have no impact on the net revenues recorded in the period the gas costs included in revenues are matched with the gas cost expense recorded in the period and the difference is recorded on the consolidated balance sheets as underrecovered or overrecovered gas cost to be included in future customer billings 

the gas distribution operations companies have pursued nontraditional revenue sources within the evolving natural gas marketplace these efforts include the sale of products and services upstream of the companies’ service territory the sale of products and services in the companies’ service territories and gas supply cost incentive mechanisms for service to their core markets the upstream products are made up of transactions that occur between an individual gas distribution operations company and a buyer for the sales of unbundled or rebundled gas supply and capacity the onsystem services are offered by nisource to customers and include products such as the transportation and balancing of gas on the gas distribution operations company system the incentive mechanisms give the gas distribution operations companies an opportunity to share in the savings created from such situations as gas purchase prices paid below an agreed upon benchmark and their ability to reduce pipeline capacity charges with their customers certain gas distribution operations companies continue to offer choice opportunities where customers can choose to purchase gas from a thirdparty supplier through regulatory initiatives in their respective jurisdictions 

capital expenditures and other investing activities 

the table below reflects actual capital expenditures and other investing activities by category for 2015 2014 and 2013 and estimates for 2016   



the gas distribution operations segment’s capital expenditures and other investing activities were  9170 million  in 2015  and are projected to be  9669 million  in 2016 this increased spending of 499 million is mainly due to growth and betterment projects in 2016 capital expenditures for 2015  were higher than 2014  by approximately 567 million primarily due to increased tdsic spend 

the gas distribution operations segment’s capital expenditures for 2014  were higher than 2013  by approximately 695 million primarily due to increased spending on infrastructure replacement projects 

regulatory matters 

refer to note 7 “regulatory matters” in the notes to consolidated financial statements for information on significant rate developments and cost recovery and trackers for the gas distribution operations segment 

customer usage   increased efficiency of natural gas appliances and improvements in home building codes and standards has contributed to a longterm trend of declining average use per customer usage for the year ended december 31 2015 decreased from the same period last year primarily due to warmer weather compared to the prior year while historically rate design at the distribution level has been structured such that a large portion of cost recovery is based upon throughput rather than in a fixed charge operating costs are largely incurred on a fixed basis and do not fluctuate due to changes in customer usage as a result gas distribution operations have pursued changes in rate design to more effectively match recoveries with costs incurred each of the states in which gas distribution operations operate has different requirements regarding the procedure for establishing

changes to rate design columbia of ohio restructured its rate design through a base rate proceeding and has adopted a “decoupled” rate design which more closely links the recovery of fixed costs with fixed charges columbia of massachusetts received regulatory approval of a decoupling mechanism which adjusts revenues to an approved benchmark level through a volumetric adjustment factor columbia of maryland and columbia of virginia have received regulatory approval to implement a revenue normalization adjustment for certain customer classes a decoupling mechanism whereby monthly revenues that exceed or fall short of approved levels are reconciled in subsequent months in a prior base rate proceeding columbia of pennsylvania implemented a residential weather normalization adjustment columbia of kentucky has had approval for a weather normalization adjustment for many years in a prior base rate proceeding nipsco implemented a higher fixed customer charge for residential and small customer classes moving toward full straight fixed variable rate design 

environmental matters 

currently various environmental matters impact the gas distribution operations segment as of december 31 2015  liabilities have been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions refer to note 18c “environmental matters” in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the gas distribution operations segment 

weather 

in general nisource calculates the weather related revenue variance based on changing customer demand driven by weather variance from normal heating degreedays nisources composite heating degree days reported do not directly correlate to the weather related dollar impact on the results of gas distribution operations heating degree days experienced during different times of the year or in different operating locations may have more or less impact on volume and dollars depending on when and where they occur when the detailed results are combined for reporting there may be weather related dollar impacts on operations when there is not an apparent or significant change in the aggregated nisource composite heating degreeday comparison 

weather in the gas distribution operations service territories for 2015  was about 3  warmer than normal and was about 12  warmer than 2014  decreasing net revenues approximately 30 million for the year ended december 31 2015 compared to 2014 

weather in the gas distribution operations service territories for 2014  was about 10  colder than normal and was about 8 colder than 2013  increasing net revenues approximately 18 million for the year ended december 31 2014 compared to 2013 

throughput 

total volumes sold and transported for the year ended december 31 2015  were 9887  mmdth compared to 10425  mmdth for 2014  this decrease is primarily attributable to warmer weather and lower offsystem sales opportunities experienced in 2015 compared to 2014 

total volumes sold and transported for the year ended december 31 2014  were 10425  mmdth compared to 10105  mmdth for 2013  this increase is primarily attributable to colder weather experienced in 2014 compared to 2013 

net revenues 

net revenues for 2015 were 19136 million an increase of 824 million from the same period in 2014 the increase in net revenues is due primarily to an increase in regulatory and service programs of 887 million including the impact of new rates at columbia of pennsylvania columbia of massachusetts and columbia of virginia as well as the implementation of new rates under columbia of ohios approved infrastructure replacement program additionally there were higher net revenues due to increased rent billed to affiliates offset in expense of 84 million and higher regulatory and tax trackers offset in expense of 75 million these increases in net revenues were partially offset by the effects of warmer weather of 306 million 

net revenues for 2014 were 18312 million an increase of 1971 million from the same period in 2013 the increase in net revenues is due primarily to an increase of 934 million for regulatory and service programs including the impacts of the rate settlement in 2013 at columbia of pennsylvania the rate case at columbia of massachusetts as well as the implementation of rates under columbia of ohios approved infrastructure replacement program additionally 2014 included an increase in regulatory and tax trackers which are offset in expense of 492 million the effects of colder weather of 184 million and higher commercial residential and industrial usage of 146 million

on june 10 2014 certain upgrade sponsors for both tuas filed a complaint at the ferc against nipsco regarding the multiplier stated in the tuas on june 30 2014 nipsco filed an answer defending the terms of the tuas and the just and reasonable nature of the multiplier charged therein and moved for dismissal of the complaint on december 8 2014 the ferc issued an order in response to the complaint finding that it is appropriate for nipsco to recover through the multiplier substantiated costs of ownership related to the tuas the ferc set for hearing the issue of what constitutes the incremental costs nipsco will incur but is holding that hearing in abeyance to allow for settlement nipsco will continue to monitor developments in this matter and does not believe the impact is material to the consolidated financial statements 

sales 

electric operations sales were 167583  gwh for the year ended 2015  a decrease of 14280  gwh compared to 2014  the 79 decrease is primarily attributable to a decrease in industrial usage which was caused by a reduction in steel production due to the high levels of imports that have impacted the domestic steel market since the start of 2015 

electric operations sales were 181863  gwh for the year ended 2014  an increase of 7183 gwh compared to 2013  the 41 increase is primarily attributable to an increase in industrial usage due to large industrial customers expanding plant operations and using less internal generation

divestiture of noncore assets 

in recent years nisource sold certain businesses judged to be noncore to nisource’s strategy lake erie land a whollyowned subsidiary of nisource is pursuing the sale of the real estate assets it owns ndc douglas properties a subsidiary of nisource development company is in the process of exiting its low income housing investments nisource sold the service plan and leasing business lines of its retail services business in january 2013 nisource also sold the commercial and industrial natural gas portfolio of its unregulated natural gas marketing business in september 2013 

business strategy 

nisource focuses its business strategy on its core rateregulated assetbased businesses with most of its operating income generated from the rateregulated businesses with one of the nation’s largest natural gas pipelines one of the largest natural gas distribution networks as measured by number of customers and one of the nations largest natural gas storage networks nisource operates throughout the energyintensive corridor that extends from the supply areas in the gulf coast through the consumption centers in 

item 1 business 

n i s ource  i nc  

the midwest midatlantic new england and northeast this corridor includes over 30 of the nation’s population and close to 31 of its natural gas consumption nisource continues to position its assets to meet the corridor’s growing energy needs 

competition and changes in the regulatory environment 

the regulatory frameworks applicable to nisource’s operations at both the state and federal levels continue to evolve these changes have had and will continue to have an impact on nisource’s operations structure and profitability management continually seeks new ways to be more competitive and profitable in this changing environment including providing gas customers with increased choices for products and services 

natural gas competition  open access to natural gas supplies over interstate pipelines and the deregulation of the commodity price of gas has led to tremendous change in the energy markets ldc customers and marketers purchase gas directly from producers and marketers as an open competitive market for gas supplies has emerged this separation or “unbundling” of the transportation and other services offered by pipelines and ldcs allows customers to purchase the commodity independent of services provided by the pipelines and ldcs the ldcs continue to purchase gas and recover the associated costs from their customers nisource’s gas distribution operations’ subsidiaries are involved in programs that provide customers the opportunity to purchase their natural gas requirements from third parties and use the nisource gas distribution operations’ subsidiaries for transportation services the columbia pipeline group operations compete for transportation customers based on the type of service a customer needs operating flexibility available capacity and price under tariff provisions 

electric competition  indiana electric utilities generally have exclusive service areas under indiana regulations and retail electric customers in indiana do not have the ability to choose their electric supplier nipsco faces nonutility competition from other energy sources such as selfgeneration by large industrial customers and other distributed energy sources

 item 1a risk factors 

n i s ource  i nc  

there are many factors that could have a material adverse effect on nisource’s operating results financial condition and cash flows each of the risks described below could adversely impact the value of nisource’s securities 

nisource has substantial indebtedness which could adversely affect its financial condition 

nisource had total consolidated indebtedness of 99994 million outstanding as of december 31 2014 the substantial indebtedness could have important consequences to investors for example it could 

  

 some of nisource’s debt obligations contain financial covenants related to debttocapital ratios and crossdefault provisions nisource’s failure to comply with any of these covenants could result in an event of default which if not cured or waived could result in the acceleration of outstanding debt obligations additionally a drop in nisource’s credit rating could adversely impact the cost for nisource to issue new debt securities 

a drop in nisource’s credit rating could adversely impact nisource’s liquidity 

the announcement of the proposed separation on september 28 2014 triggered ratings reviews by standard  poor’s standard  poors moody’s investors service moodys and fitch ratings inc fitch on september 29 2014 standard  poors affirmed the senior unsecured ratings for nisource and the existing ratings of its other rated subsidiaries at bbb and the nisource finance commercial paper rating of a3 placing the company’s ratings on watch positive on september 29 2014 moodys investors service affirmed the nisource senior unsecured rating of baa2 and commercial paper rating of p2 with a stable outlook additionally moodys affirmed nipsco’s baa1 rating and affirmed the baa2 rating for columbia of massachusetts on september 29 2014 fitch affirmed the senior unsecured ratings for nisource at bbb and the existing ratings of its other rated subsidiaries fitchs outlook for nisource and its subsidiaries is stable although all ratings continue to be investment grade a downgrade by either standard  poors or fitch would result in a rating that is below investment grade 

certain nisource affiliates have agreements that contain “ratings triggers” that require increased collateral if the credit ratings of nisource or certain of its subsidiaries are rated below bbb by standard  poors or baa3 by moodys these agreements are primarily for insurance purposes and for the physical purchase or sale of power the collateral requirement that would be required in the event of a downgrade below the ratings trigger levels would amount to approximately 393 million  in addition to agreements with ratings triggers there are other agreements that contain “adequate assurance” or “material adverse change” provisions that could necessitate additional credit support such as letters of credit and cash collateral to transact business a credit downgrade could also adversely affect the availability and cost of capital needed to fund the growth investments that are a central element of nisources longterm business strategy 

these requirements combined with other potential negative effects on nisource’s liquidity in the event of a credit downgrade below an investment grade rating could have a material adverse effect on earnings potential and cash flows lastly a credit downgrade could adversely affect the availability and cost of capital needed to fund the growth investments which are a central element of the company’s longterm business strategy 

nisource may not be able to execute its growth strategy as planned 

because of changes in the business or regulatory environment nisource may not be able to execute its business plan as intended nisource’s commercial and regulatory initiatives may not achieve planned results levels of commercial growth and expansion of the gas transmission and storage business may be less than its plan has anticipated natural gas production activity including production facilitated by hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling could be less than anticipated which could adversely affect nisource’s gas transmission storage and midstream business expansion opportunities and therefore the actual results of 

item 1a risk factors 

n i s ource  i nc  

nisource’s financial management of the balance sheet and process and expense management could deviate materially from planned outcomes in addition nisource’s growth plan relies on the continued view of natural gas as an economically and ecologically attractive fuel any developments that cause natural gas no longer to be seen as a favored fuel could adversely affect our results of operations and growth prospects 

adverse economic and market conditions or increases in interest rates could reduce net revenue growth increase costs decrease future net income and cash flows and impact capital resources and liquidity needs 

while the national economy is experiencing some recovery from the recent downturn nisource cannot predict how robust the recovery will be or whether or not it will be sustained 

continued sluggishness in the economy impacting nisource’s operating jurisdictions could adversely impact nisource’s ability to grow its customer base and collect revenues from customers which could reduce net revenue growth and increase operating costs an increase in the interest rates nisource pays would adversely affect future net income and cash flows in addition nisource depends on debt to finance its operations including both working capital and capital expenditures and would be adversely affected by increases in interest rates if the current economic recovery remains slow or credit markets again tighten nisource’s ability to raise additional capital or refinance debt at a reasonable cost could be negatively impacted refer to note 14 “longterm debt” in the notes to consolidated financial statements for information related to outstanding longterm debt and maturities of that debt 

capital market performance and other factors may decrease the value of benefit plan assets which then could require significant additional funding and impact earnings 

the performance of the capital markets affects the value of the assets that are held in trust to satisfy future obligations under defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans nisource has significant obligations in these areas and holds significant assets in these trusts these assets are subject to market fluctuations and may yield uncertain returns which fall below nisource’s projected rates of return a decline in the market value of assets may increase the funding requirements of the obligations under the defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans additionally changes in interest rates affect the liabilities under these benefit plans as interest rates decrease the liabilities increase which could potentially increase funding requirements further the funding requirements of the obligations related to these benefits plans may increase due to changes in governmental regulations and participant demographics including increased numbers of retirements or changes in life expectancy assumptions ultimately significant funding requirements and increased pension expense could negatively impact nisource’s results of operations and financial position 

the majority of nisource’s net revenues are subject to economic regulation and are exposed to the impact of regulatory rate reviews and proceedings 

most of nisource’s net revenues are subject to economic regulation at either the federal or state level as such the net revenues generated by those regulated companies are subject to regulatory review by the applicable federal or state authority these rate reviews determine the rates charged to customers and directly impact revenues nisource’s financial results are dependent on frequent regulatory proceedings in order to ensure timely recovery of costs additionally the costs of complying with future changes in environmental laws and regulations are expected to be significant and their recovery through rates will be contingent on regulatory approval 

as a result of efforts to introduce marketbased competition in certain markets where the regulated businesses conduct operations nisource may compete with independent marketers for customers this competition exposes nisource to the risk that certain stranded costs may not be recoverable and may affect results of nisource’s growth strategy and cash flows 

  

nisource’s costs of compliance with environmental laws are significant the costs of compliance with future environmental laws and the recognition of environmental liabilities could impact cash flow and profitability 

nisource’s subsidiaries are subject to extensive federal state and local environmental requirements that among other things regulate air emissions water usage and discharges remediation and the management of chemicals hazardous waste solid waste and coal combustion residuals compliance with these legal obligations requires nisource to make expenditures for installation of pollution control equipment remediation environmental monitoring emissions fees and permits at many of nisource’s facilities these expenditures are significant and nisource expects that they will continue to be significant in the future furthermore if nisource’s subsidiaries fail to comply with environmental laws and regulations or cause harm to the environment or persons even 

item 1a risk factors 

n i s ource  i nc  

if caused by factors beyond nisource’s control that failure or harm may result in the assessment of civil or criminal penalties and damages against nisource and its subsidiaries 

existing environmental laws and regulations may be revised and new laws and regulations seeking to protect the environment may be adopted or become applicable to nisource’s subsidiaries revised or additional laws and regulations could result in significant additional expense and operating restrictions on nisource’s facilities or increased compliance costs which may not be fully recoverable from customers and would therefore reduce net income moreover such costs could materially affect the continued economic viability of one or more of nisource’s facilities 

because nisource’s operations deal with natural gas and coal fossil fuels emissions of ghgs are an expected aspect of the business while nisource attempts to reduce ghg emissions through efficiency programs leak detection and other programs ghg emissions cannot be entirely eliminated the current administration has made it clear that it is focused on reducing ghg emissions through legislation andor regulation imposing statutory or regulatory restrictions andor costs on ghg emissions could increase nisource’s cost of producing energy which could impact customer demand or nisource’s profitability compliance costs associated with these requirements could also affect nisource’s cash flow the cost impact of any new or amended ghg legislation or regulations would depend upon the specific requirements enacted and cannot be determined at this time 

even in instances where legal and regulatory requirements are already known the original estimates for cleanup and environmental capital projects can differ materially from the amount ultimately expended the actual future expenditures depend on many factors including the nature and extent of contamination the method of cleanup the cost of raw materials contractor costs and the availability of cost recovery from customers changes in costs and the ability to recover under regulatory mechanisms could affect nisource’s financial position operating results and cash flows 

a significant portion of the gas and electricity nisource sells is used by residential and commercial customers for heating and air conditioning accordingly the operating results fluctuate depending on the weather and to a certain extent usage of gas or electricity 

energy sales are sensitive to variations in weather forecasts of energy sales are based on normal weather which represents a longterm historical average significant variations from normal weather could have and have had a material impact on energy sales additionally residential usage and to some degree commercial usage have shown to be sensitive to fluctuations in commodity costs for gas and electricity whereby usage declines with increased costs thus affecting nisource’s financial results lastly residential and commercial customers’ usage has shown to be sensitive to economic conditions and the impact of macroeconomic drivers such as unemployment consumption and consumer confidence which could also affect nisource’s financial results 

nisource’s business operations are subject to economic conditions in certain industries 

business operations throughout nisource’s service territories have been and may continue to be adversely affected by economic events at the national and local level where it operates in particular sales to large industrial customers may be impacted by economic downturns the us manufacturing industry continues to adjust to changing market conditions including international competition increasing costs and fluctuating demand for its products 

fluctuations in the price of energy commodities or their related transportation costs may have a negative impact on nisource’s financial results 

nisource’s electric generating fleet is dependent on coal and natural gas for fuel and its gas distribution operations purchase and resell much of the natural gas they deliver these energy commodities are vulnerable to price fluctuations and fluctuations in associated transportation costs hedging activities have been deployed in order to offset fluctuations in commodity supply prices and nisource relies on regulatory recovery mechanisms in the various jurisdictions in order to fully recover the costs incurred in operations however while nisource has historically been successful in recovery of costs related to such commodity prices there can be no assurance that such costs will be fully recovered through rates in a timely manner additionally increased gas and electricity costs could result in reduced demand from customers as a result of increased conservation activities 

nisource is exposed to risk that customers will not remit payment for delivered energy or services and that suppliers or counterparties will not perform under various financial or operating agreements 

nisource’s extension of credit is governed by a corporate credit risk policy involves considerable judgment and is based on an evaluation of a customer or counterparty’s financial condition credit history and other factors credit risk exposure is monitored by obtaining credit reports and updated financial information for customers and suppliers and by evaluating the financial status of its banking partners and other counterparties through the use of marketbased metrics such as credit default swap pricing levels 

item 1a risk factors 

n i s ource  i nc  

and also through traditional credit ratings provided by the major credit rating agencies continued adverse economic conditions could increase credit risk and could result in a material adverse effect on nisource 

nisource has significant goodwill and definitelived intangible assets an impairment of goodwill or definitelived intangible assets could result in a significant charge to earnings 

in accordance with gaap nisource tests goodwill for impairment at least annually and reviews its definitelived intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable goodwill also is tested for impairment when factors examples of which include reduced cash flow estimates a sustained decline in stock price or market capitalization below book value indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable nisource would be required to record a charge in the financial statements during the period in which any impairment of the goodwill or definitelived intangible assets is determined negatively impacting the results of operations a significant charge could impact the capitalization ratio covenant under certain financing agreements nisource is subject to a financial covenant under its fiveyear revolving credit facility and its term loans which requires nisource to maintain a debt to capitalization ratio that does not exceed 70 a similar covenant in a 2005 private placement note purchase agreement requires nisource to maintain a debt to capitalization ratio that does not exceed 75 as of december 31 2014 the ratio was 62  

changes in taxation and the ability to quantify such changes could adversely affect nisource’s financial results 

nisource is subject to taxation by the various taxing authorities at the federal state and local levels where it does business legislation or regulation which could affect nisource’s tax burden could be enacted by any of these governmental authorities nisource cannot predict the timing or extent of such taxrelated developments which could have a negative impact on the financial results additionally nisource uses its best judgment in attempting to quantify and reserve for these tax obligations however a challenge by a taxing authority nisource’s ability to utilize tax benefits such as carryforwards or tax credits or a deviation from other taxrelated assumptions may cause actual financial results to deviate from previous estimates 

changes in accounting principles may adversely affect nisource’s financial results 

future changes in accounting rules and associated changes in regulatory accounting may negatively impact the way nisource records revenues expenses assets and liabilities these changes in accounting standards may adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations 

  

transportation and storage of natural gas as well as generation transmission and distribution of electricity involve numerous risks that may result in accidents and other operating risks and costs 

nisources gas distribution and gas transmission and storage activities as well as generation transmission and distribution of electricity involve a variety of inherent hazards and operating risks such as gas leaks downed power lines accidents including thirdparty damages large scale outages and mechanical problems which could cause substantial financial losses in addition these risks could result in serious injury or loss of life to employees and the general public significant damage to property environmental pollution impairment of its operations adverse regulatory rulings and reputational harm which in turn could lead to substantial losses to nisource in accordance with customary industry practice nisource maintains insurance against some but not all of these risks and losses the location of pipelines and storage facilities or generation transmission substations and distribution facilities near populated areas including residential areas commercial business centers and industrial sites could increase the level of damages resulting from these risks the occurrence of any of these events could adversely affect nisources financial position and results of operations 

aging infrastructure may lead to increased costs and disruptions in operations that could negatively impact nisource’s financial results 

nisource has risks associated with aging infrastructure assets the age of these assets may result in a need for replacement a higher level of maintenance costs and unscheduled outages despite diligent efforts by nisource to properly maintain these assets through inspection scheduled maintenance and capital investment the failure to operate these assets as desired could result in nisource’s inability to meet firm service obligations adversely impact revenues and result in increased capital expenditures and expenses which may not be fully recoverable from customers

climate change natural disasters acts of terrorism or other catastrophic events may disrupt operations and reduce the ability to service customers 

a disruption or failure of natural gas transmission storage or distribution systems or within electric generation transmission or distribution systems in the event of a major hurricane tornado terrorist attack or other catastrophic event could cause delays in completing sales providing services or performing other critical functions nisource has experienced disruptions in the past from hurricanes and tornadoes and other events of this nature the cost availability and sufficiency of insurance for these risks could adversely affect nisource’s results of operations financial position and cash flows 

there is also a concern that climate change may exacerbate the risks to physical infrastructure associated with heat and extreme weather conditions climate change and the costs that may be associated with its impacts have the potential to affect nisource’s business in many ways including increasing the cost nisource incurs in providing its products and services impacting the demand for and consumption of its products and services due to change in both costs and weather patterns and affecting the economic health of the regions in which nisource operates 

a cyberattack on any of nisources or certain thirdparty computer systems upon which nisource relies may adversely affect its ability to operate 

nisource is reliant on technology to run its businesses which are dependent upon financial and operational computer systems to process critical information necessary to conduct various elements of its business including the generation transmission and distribution of electricity operation of its gas pipelines and storage facilities and the recording and reporting of commercial and financial transactions to regulators investors and other stakeholders any failure of nisource’s computer systems or those of its customers suppliers or others with whom it does business could materially disrupt nisource’s ability to operate its business and could result in a financial loss and possibly do harm to nisource’s reputation 

additionally nisources information systems experience ongoing often sophisticated cyberattacks by a variety of sources with the apparent aim to breach nisources cyberdefenses although nisource attempts to maintain adequate defenses to these attacks and works through industry groups and trade associations to identify common threats and assess nisources countermeasures a security breach of nisources information systems could i impact the reliability of nisources generation transmission storage and distribution systems and potentially negatively impact nisources compliance with certain mandatory reliability standards ii subject nisource to harm associated with theft or inappropriate release of certain types of information such as system operating information or information personal or otherwise relating to nisources customers or employees or iii impact nisources ability to manage nisources businesses 

nisources capital projects subject it to construction risks and natural gas costs and supply risks 

nisource’s columbia pipeline group operations continues to complete and advance customerdriven expansion projects across its system and develop its midstream business through gathering and processing activities primarily surrounding the marcellus and utica shale production area in the states of pennsylvania ohio and west virginia additionally nisource is executing on its comprehensive interstate natural gas pipeline modernization program these modernization projects include constructing or replacing pipelines and other facilities which subjects nisource to construction risks and risks that gas supplies may not be available some expansion projects may also be subject to risks related to fluctuation in construction and gas costs both modernization and expansion projects are reliant on the contractual performance of vendors and suppliers of materials and supplies and services nonperformance or underperformance could subject nisource to increased costs further nisource is subject to regulatory approval of various projects delays in this process could increase costs of the projects 

nisource competes for these projects with companies of varying size and financial capabilities including some that may have advantages competing for natural gas and liquid gas supplies as well as acquisitions and other business opportunities similarly nisource gas distribution operations is engaged in an intrastate natural gas pipeline modernization program to maintain system integrity and enhance service reliability and flexibility nipsco also is currently engaged in a number of capital projects including airquality related improvements to its electric generating stations as well as the construction of new transmission facilities as nisource undertakes these projects it may not be able to complete them on schedule or at the anticipated costs additionally nisource may construct or purchase some of these projects to capture anticipated future growth in natural gas production which may not materialize and may cause the construction to occur over an extended period of time nisource also may not receive material increases in revenue and cash flows until after the completion of the projects 

  

item 1a risk factors 

n i s ource  i nc  

sustained extreme weather conditions may negatively impact nisource’s operations 

nisource conducts its operations across a wide geographic area subject to varied and potentially extreme weather conditions which may from time to time persist for sustained periods of time despite preventative maintenance efforts persistent weather related stress on nisource’s infrastructure may reveal weaknesses in its systems not previously known to the company or otherwise present various operational challenges across all business segments although nisource makes every effort to plan for weather related contingencies adverse weather may affect its ability to conduct operations in a manner that satisfies customer expectations or contractual obligations the company endeavors to minimize such service disruptions but may not be able to avoid them altogether 

growing competition in the gas transportation and storage industries could result in the failure by customers to renew existing contracts 

as a consequence of the increase in competition and the shift in natural gas production areas customers such as ldcs and other end users may be reluctant to enter into longterm service contracts the renewal or replacement of existing contracts with nisource’s customers at rates sufficient to maintain current or projected revenues and cash flows depends on a number of factors beyond its control including competition from other pipelines gatherers the proximity of supplies to the markets and the price of and demand for natural gas the inability of nisource to renew or replace its current contracts as they expire and respond appropriately to changing market conditions could materially impact its financial results and cash flows 

nisource is a holding company and is dependent on cash generated by subsidiaries to meet its debt obligations and pay dividends on its common stock 

nisource is a holding company and conducts its operations primarily through its subsidiaries substantially all of nisource’s consolidated assets are held by its subsidiaries accordingly nisource’s ability to meet its debt obligations or pay dividends on its common stock is largely dependent upon cash generated by these subsidiaries in the event a major subsidiary is not able to pay dividends or transfer cash flows to nisource nisources ability to service its debt obligations or pay dividends could be negatively affected 

following the proposed separation all of the entities that make up nisources columbia pipeline group operations will be separated from nisource into a separately publicly traded company the related assets will no longer be held by subsidiaries of nisource which may negatively affect nisources ability to service its debt obligations or pay dividends 

the proposed separation may not be completed on the currently contemplated timeline or terms or at all and may not achieve the intended benefits 

the proposed separation is subject to conditions including without limitation final nisource board of directors approval and the receipt by nisource of a legal opinion to the effect that the distribution of cpg shares to nisource stockholders will qualify as taxfree under section 355 of the us internal revenue code unanticipated developments or changes in market conditions may delay the proposed separation and the proposed separation may not occur on the currently contemplated timeline or at all 

nisource cannot predict with certainty when the benefits expected from the proposed separation will occur or the extent to which they will be achieved if at all furthermore there are various uncertainties and risks relating to the process of the proposed separation that could have a negative impact on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows including disruption of our operations and impairment of our relationship with regulators key personnel customers and vendors 

if the proposed separation is successfully completed nisource will face new and unique risks including having fewer assets reduced financial resources and less diversification of revenue sources which may adversely impact nisource’s financial condition results of operations and cash flows in addition the changes in our operational and financial profile may not meet some or all of our stockholders’ investment strategies which could cause investors to sell their nisource shares and otherwise decrease demand for shares of nisource common stock excess selling will cause the relative market price of nisource common stock to decrease and the market price of nisource common stock may be subject to greater volatility following the completion of the proposed separation 

a condition to the proposed separation is the receipt by nisource of a legal opinion to the effect that the distribution of cpg shares to nisource stockholders will qualify as taxfree under section 355 of the us internal revenue code however even if we receive such an opinion the internal revenue service could determine on audit that the distribution is taxable both nisource and our stockholders could incur significant us federal income tax liabilities if taxing authorities conclude the distribution is taxable

following the proposed separation both nisource and cpg expect to initially receive an investment grade credit rating from standard  poor’s rating service moody’s investor service and fitch ratings inc ratings from credit agencies are not recommendations to buy sell or hold our securities and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating we may not initially receive such ratings or if received our credit ratings could be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if in its judgment the circumstances warrant there is no assurance that we will continue to maintain such investment grade credit ratings in the future if a rating agency were to downgrade our rating below investment grade our borrowing costs would increase and our funding sources could decrease in addition a failure by us to maintain an investment grade rating could affect our business relationships with suppliers and operating partners see a drop in nisources credit rating could adversely impact nisources liquidity above

results of operations 

income from continuing operations and net income 

for the year ended december 31 2014  nisource reported income from continuing operations of 5307 million  or 168  per basic share compared to 4909 million  or 157  per basic share in 2013  income from continuing operations for the year ended december 31 2012  was 4088 million  or 140  per basic share 

including results from discontinued operations nisource reported 2014  net income of 5300 million  or 168  per basic share 2013  net income of 5321 million  or 170  per basic share and 2012  net income of 4161 million  or 143  per basic share 

comparability of line item operating results was impacted by regulatory and tax trackers that allow for the recovery in rates of certain costs such as bad debt expenses therefore increases in these tracked operating expenses were offset by increases in net revenues and had essentially no impact on income from continuing operations an increase in operating expenses of 1373 million and 1187 million for the years ended 2014 and 2013 respectively were offset by a corresponding increase to net revenues reflecting these tracked costs 

net revenues 

nisource analyzes the operating results using net revenues net revenues are calculated as revenues less the associated cost of sales excluding depreciation and amortization nisource believes net revenues is a better measure to analyze profitability than gross operating revenues since the majority of the cost of sales are tracked costs that are passed through directly to the customer resulting in an equal and offsetting amount reflected in gross operating revenues 

total consolidated net revenues for the year ended december 31 2014  were 42464 million  a 4046 million increase compared with 2013  net revenues increased primarily due to increased gas distribution operations net revenues of 1971 million higher columbia pipeline group operations net revenues of 1675 million and increased electric operations net revenues of 413 million

for recovery additionally there were increased net revenues of 59 million as a result of two electric transmission projects authorized by the miso and higher offsystem sales of 47 million these increases were partially offset by a decrease in transmission upgrade revenue of 65 million included in net revenue in the prior year and the effects of weather of 53 million 

total consolidated net revenues for the twelve months ended december 31 2013  were 38418 million  a 3278 million increase compared with 2012  net revenues increased primarily due to increased columbia pipeline group operations net revenues of 1790 million higher gas distribution operations net revenues of 1403 million and increased electric operations net revenues of 86 million 

 expenses 

operating expenses were 30306 million  in 2014  an increase of 2963 million from the comparable 2013  period this increase was primarily due to an increase in operation and maintenance expenses of 2624 million higher depreciation and amortization of 282 million and increased other taxes of 197 million partially offset by an increase in the gain on sale of assets of 140 million the increase in operation and maintenance is due primarily to increased regulatory trackers which are offset in net revenues of 1287 million higher employee and administrative costs of 646 million due primarily to greater labor expense due to a growing workforce timing of outages and maintenance and it support and enhancement projects increased outside services of 497 million primarily due to costs associated with the proposed separation and gas distribution operations pipeline safety initiatives higher electric generation costs of 152 million as a result of maintenance related outages increased materials and supplies of 75 million higher uncollectibles of 66 million and an insurance reserve adjustment of 34 million these increases were partially offset by lower software data conversion costs of 89 million and a decrease in environmental costs of 64 million the increase in depreciation and amortization is primarily due to increased capital expenditures related to projects placed in service the increase in gain on the sale of assets is primarily resulting from the increased gains on conveyance of mineral interests of 272 million offset by the gain on the sale of storage base gas in 2013 of 111 million 

operating expenses were 27343 million  in 2013  an increase of 2282 million from the comparable 2012  period this increase was primarily due to an increase in operation and maintenance expenses of 2136 million higher depreciation and amortization of 154 million and increased other taxes of 129 million partially offset by an increase in the gain on sale of assets of 137 million the increase in operation and maintenance is due primarily to increased regulatory trackers which are offset in net revenues of 1300 million higher employee and administrative costs of 605 million due primarily to greater labor expense due to a growing workforce timing of outages and maintenance and it support and enhancement projects increased outside services of 102 million software data conversion costs of 89 million and a marktomarket adjustment of corporate owned life insurance assets primarily in the prior year of 57 million these increases were partially offset by lower electric generation costs of 131 million as a result of the timing of planned and unplanned outages the increase in depreciation and amortization is primarily due

other income deductions in 2014  reduced income 4213 million  compared to a reduction of 3906 million  in 2013  the increase in deductions is primarily due to an increase in interest expense of 288 million in 2014 compared to 2013 this increase is primarily attributable to the issuance of 5000 million of longterm debt in october 2013 7500 million of longterm debt in april 2013 and the expiration of 5000 million of fixedtovariable interest rate swaps in july 2014 these increases were partially offset by the maturity of 5000 million of longterm debt in july 2014 

other income deductions in 2013  reduced income 3906 million  compared to a reduction of 4166 million  in 2012  the decrease in deductions is primarily due to an increase in other net of 225 million in 2013 compared to 2012 this increase is primarily attributable to a gain from insurance proceeds and afudc earnings interest expense of 4148 million was recorded in 2013 a decrease of 35 million compared to the prior year the decrease resulted from the maturity of 4203 million of longterm debt in march 2013 and 3150 million of longterm debt in november 2012 increased afudc rates and lower average shortterm borrowings partially offset by higher interest expense from the issuance of 5000 million of longterm debt in october 2013 7500 million of longterm debt in april 2013 and 7500 million of longterm debt in june 2012

for 2015  the projected capital program and certain other investing activities are expected to be 24048 million  which is 2213 million higher than the 2014 capital program this increased spending is mainly due to increased spending in the columbia pipeline group operations segment due to an increase in system growth and equity investments as a result of the current profile of identified growth projects in 2015 partially offset by a decrease in the modernization and maintenance spend attributed to advanced spend for the modernization program in 2014 

for 2014  the capital expenditures and certain other investing activities were 21835 million  which is 1375 million higher than the 2013 capital program this increased spending is mainly due to continued spending on infrastructure replacement programs in the gas distribution operations segment and increased spending in the columbia pipeline group operations segment due to system growth and equity investments in the marcellus and utica shale areas 

for 2013  capital expenditures and certain other investing activities were 20460 million  an increase of 4609 million compared to 2012  this increased spending is mainly due to higher expenditures for the modernization program and system growth and equity investments in the marcellus and utica shale areas in the columbia pipeline group operations segment and increased spending in the gas distribution operations segment due to increased spending on infrastructure replacement programs capital spending in the electric operations segment in 2013 was comparable to 2012 due to continued spending on the environmental tracker capital projects in the generation fleet

market risk disclosures 

risk is an inherent part of nisource’s energy businesses the extent to which nisource properly and effectively identifies assesses monitors and manages each of the various types of risk involved in its businesses is critical to its profitability nisource seeks to identify assess monitor and manage in accordance with defined policies and procedures the following principal market risks that are involved in nisource’s energy businesses commodity price risk interest rate risk and credit risk risk management at nisource is a multifaceted process with oversight by the risk management committee that requires constant communication judgment and knowledge of specialized products and markets nisource’s senior management takes an active role in the risk management process and has developed policies and procedures that require specific administrative and business functions to assist in the identification assessment and control of various risks these include but are not limited to market operational financial compliance and strategic risk types in recognition of the increasingly varied and complex nature of the energy business nisource’s risk management process policies and procedures continue to evolve and are subject to ongoing review and modification 

  

commodity price risk 

nisource is exposed to commodity price risk as a result of its subsidiaries’ operations involving natural gas and power to manage this market risk nisource’s subsidiaries use derivatives including commodity futures contracts swaps and options nisource is not involved in speculative energy trading activity 

commodity price risk resulting from derivative activities at nisource’s rateregulated subsidiaries is limited since regulations allow recovery of prudently incurred purchased power fuel and gas costs through the ratemaking process including gains or losses on these derivative instruments if states should explore additional regulatory reform these subsidiaries may begin providing services without the benefit of the traditional ratemaking process and may be more exposed to commodity price risk some of nisource’s rateregulated utility subsidiaries offer commodity price risk products to its customers for which derivatives are used to hedge forecasted customer usage under such products these subsidiaries do not have regulatory recovery orders for these products and are subject to gains and losses recognized in earnings due to hedge ineffectiveness 

nisource subsidiaries are required to make cash margin deposits with their brokers to cover actual and potential losses in the value of outstanding exchange traded derivative contracts the amount of these deposits which are reflected in nisource’s restricted cash balance may fluctuate significantly during periods of high volatility in the energy commodity markets 

there are no material commodity price risk assets or liabilities as of december 31 2014  and 2013  

interest rate risk 

nisource is exposed to interest rate risk as a result of changes in interest rates on borrowings under its revolving credit agreement term loan commercial paper program and accounts receivable programs which have interest rates that are indexed to shortterm market interest rates based upon average borrowings and debt obligations subject to fluctuations in shortterm market interest rates an increase or decrease in shortterm interest rates of 100 basis points 1 would have increased or decreased interest expense by 200 million  and 142 million  for the years 2014  and 2013  respectively 

  

credit risk 

due to the nature of the industry credit risk is embedded in many of nisource’s business activities nisource’s extension of credit is governed by a corporate credit risk policy in addition risk management committee guidelines are in place which document management approval levels for credit limits evaluation of creditworthiness and credit risk mitigation efforts exposures to credit risks are monitored by the corporate credit risk function which is independent of commercial operations credit risk arises due to the possibility that a customer supplier or counterparty will not be able or willing to fulfill its obligations on a transaction on or before the settlement date for derivative related contracts credit risk arises when counterparties are obligated to deliver or purchase defined commodity units of gas or power to nisource at a future date per execution of contractual terms and conditions exposure to credit risk is measured in terms of both current obligations and the market value of forward positions net of any posted collateral such as cash and letters of credit 

nisource closely monitors the financial status of its banking credit providers nisource evaluates the financial status of its banking partners through the use of marketbased metrics such as credit default swap pricing levels and also through traditional credit ratings provided by major credit rating agencies

fair value measurement 

nisource measures certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value the level of the fair value hierarchy disclosed is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement nisource’s financial assets and liabilities include price risk assets and liabilities availableforsale securities and a deferred compensation plan obligation 

exchangetraded derivative contracts are generally based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets and are classified within level 1 these financial assets and liabilities are secured with cash on deposit with the exchange therefore nonperformance risk has not been incorporated into these valuations certain nonexchangetraded derivatives are valued using broker or overthecounter online exchanges in such cases these nonexchangetraded derivatives are classified within level 2 nonexchangebased derivative instruments include swaps forwards and options in certain instances nisource may utilize models to measure fair value valuation models utilize various inputs that include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active other observable inputs for the asset or liability and marketcorroborated inputs ie inputs derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means where observable inputs are available for substantially the full term of the asset or liability the instrument is categorized in level 2 certain derivatives trade in less active markets with a lower availability of pricing information and models may be utilized in the valuation when such inputs have a significant impact on the measurement of fair value the instrument is categorized in level 3 credit risk is considered in the fair value calculation of derivative instruments that are not exchangetraded credit exposures are adjusted to reflect collateral agreements which reduce exposures 

refer to note 16 “fair value” in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on nisource’s fair value measurements 

other information 

critical accounting policies 

nisource applies certain accounting policies based on the accounting requirements discussed below that have had and may continue to have significant impacts on nisource’s results of operations and consolidated balance sheets 

basis of accounting for rateregulated subsidiaries  asc topic 980 regulated operations  provides that rateregulated subsidiaries account for and report assets and liabilities consistent with the economic effect of the way in which regulators establish rates if the rates established are designed to recover the costs of providing the regulated service and if the competitive environment makes it probable that such rates can be charged and collected certain expenses and credits subject to utility regulation or rate determination normally reflected in income are deferred on the consolidated balance sheets and are recognized in income as the related amounts are included in service rates and recovered from or refunded to customers the total amounts of regulatory assets and liabilities reflected on the consolidated balance sheets were 18899 million  and 17362 million  at december 31 2014  and 16650 million  and 17300 million  at december 31 2013  respectively for additional information refer to note 7 “regulatory matters” in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

in the event that regulation significantly changes the opportunity for nisource to recover its costs in the future all or a portion of nisource’s regulated operations may no longer meet the criteria for the application of asc topic 980 regulated operations  in such event a writedown of all or a portion of nisource’s existing regulatory assets and liabilities could result if transition cost recovery is approved by the appropriate regulatory bodies that would meet the requirements under gaap for continued accounting as regulatory assets and liabilities during such recovery period the regulatory assets and liabilities would be reported at the recoverable amounts if unable to continue to apply the provisions of asc topic 980 regulated operations  nisource would be required to apply the provisions of asc topic 98020 discontinuation of rateregulated accounting  in management’s opinion nisource’s regulated subsidiaries will be subject to asc topic 980 regulated operations  for the foreseeable future 

certain of the regulatory assets reflected on nisource’s consolidated balance sheets require specific regulatory action in order to be included in future service rates although recovery of these amounts is not guaranteed nisource believes that these costs meet the requirements for deferral as regulatory assets regulatory assets requiring specific regulatory action amounted to 1839 million  at december 31 2014  if nisource determined that the amounts included as regulatory assets were not recoverable a charge to income would immediately be required to the extent of the unrecoverable amounts 

pensions and postretirement benefits  nisource has defined benefit plans for both pensions and other postretirement benefits the calculation of the net obligations and annual expense related to the plans requires a significant degree of judgment regarding the discount rates to be used in bringing the liabilities to present value longterm returns on plan assets and employee longevity among other assumptions due to the size of the plans and the longterm nature of the associated liabilities changes in the

assumptions used in the actuarial estimates could have material impacts on the measurement of the net obligations and annual expense recognition for further discussion of nisource’s pensions and other postretirement benefits see note 10 “pension and other postretirement benefits” in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

goodwill  nisource’s goodwill assets at december 31 2014  were 36662 million  most of which resulted from the acquisition of columbia on november 1 2000 in addition nipsco gas distribution operations’ goodwill assets at december 31 2014  related to the purchase of northern indiana fuel and light in march 1993 and kokomo gas in february 1992 were 178 million  as required nisource tests for impairment of goodwill on an annual basis and on an interim basis when events or circumstances indicate that a potential impairment may exist nisource’s annual goodwill test takes place in the second quarter of each year and was most recently finalized as of may 1 2014 

nisource completed a quantitative step 1 fair value measurement of its reporting units during the may 1 2012 goodwill test the test indicated that the fair value of each of the reporting units that carry or are allocated goodwill substantially exceeded their carrying values indicating that no impairment existed under the step 1 annual impairment test a qualitative step 0 test was performed as of may 1 2014 and 2013 nisource assessed various assumptions events and circumstances that would have affected the estimated fair value of the reporting units in its baseline may 1 2012 test the results of this assessment indicated that it is not more likely than not that its reporting unit fair values are less than the reporting unit carrying values and no impairments are necessary 

although there was no goodwill asset impairment as of may 1 2014 an interim impairment test could be triggered by the following actual earnings results that are materially lower than expected significant adverse changes in the operating environment an increase in the discount rate changes in other key assumptions which require judgment and are forward looking in nature or if nisource’s market capitalization stays below book value for an extended period of time no  impairment triggers were identified subsequent to may 1 2014 

during the first quarter of 2013 as part of the sale of the service plan and leasing business lines of its retail services business nisource allocated 100 million  of goodwill from columbia distribution operations to the sale and allocated 10 million  of goodwill from nipsco gas distribution operations to the sale refer to note 3 discontinued operations and assets and liabilities held for sale for more information

competition 

gas distribution operations competes with investorowned municipal and cooperative electric utilities throughout its service area and to a lesser extent with other regulated natural gas utilities and propane and fuel oil suppliers gas distribution operations continues to be a strong competitor in the energy market as a result of strong customer preference for natural gas competition with providers of electricity is generally strongest in the residential and commercial markets of kentucky southern ohio central pennsylvania and western virginia where electric rates are primarily driven by lowcost coalfired generation in ohio and pennsylvania similar gas provider competition is also common natural gas competes with fuel oil and propane in the massachusetts market mainly due to the installed base of fuel oil and propanebased heating which over time has comprised a declining percentage of the overall market

market conditions 

during 2014 spot prices at the henry hub for the winter through december 2014 have primarily been in the 2745  4280dth range compared to prices in the 3360  4520dth range experienced during the winter through december 2013 

entering the 20142015 winter season national storage levels were 238 bcf below the prior year and 261 bcf below the 5 year average inventory levels based on november 6 2014 energy information administration storage report during the summer of 2014 prices ranged between 3515 and 4835dth which were higher than those prices experienced in the summer of 2013 

all nisource gas distribution operations companies have stateapproved recovery mechanisms that provide a means for full recovery of prudently incurred gas costs gas costs are treated as passthrough costs and have no impact on the net revenues recorded in the period the gas costs included in revenues are matched with the gas cost expense recorded in the period and the difference is recorded on the consolidated balance sheets as underrecovered or overrecovered gas cost to be included in future customer billings 

the gas distribution operations companies have pursued nontraditional revenue sources within the evolving natural gas marketplace these efforts include the sale of products and services upstream of the companies’ service territory the sale of products and services in the companies’ service territories and gas supply cost incentive mechanisms for service to their core markets the upstream products are made up of transactions that occur between an individual gas distribution operations company and a buyer for the sales of unbundled or rebundled gas supply and capacity the onsystem services are offered by nisource to customers and include products such as the transportation and balancing of gas on the gas distribution operations company system the incentive mechanisms give the gas distribution operations companies an opportunity to share in the savings created from such things as gas purchase prices paid below an agreed upon benchmark and its ability to reduce pipeline capacity charges with their customers certain gas distribution operations companies continue to offer choice opportunities where customers can choose to purchase gas from a thirdparty supplier through regulatory initiatives in their respective jurisdictions 

capital expenditures and other investing activities 

the table below reflects actual capital expenditures and other investing activities by category for 2012 2013 and 2014 and estimates for 2015   



the gas distribution operations segment’s capital expenditures and other investing activities were  8603 million  in 2014  and are projected to be  8919 million  in 2015 the estimated 2015 capital expenditures are 316 million higher than 2014 primarily due to increased tdsic spend capital expenditures for 2014  were higher than 2013  by approximately 695 million primarily due to increased spending on infrastructure replacement projects 

the gas distribution operations segment’s capital expenditures for 2013 were higher than 2012 by approximately 1414 million primarily due to increased spending on infrastructure replacement projects 

regulatory matters 

refer to note 7 “regulatory matters” in the notes to consolidated financial statements for information on significant rate developments and cost recovery and trackers for the gas distribution operations segment 

customer usage  increased efficiency of natural gas appliances and improvements in home building codes and standards has contributed to a longterm trend of declining average use per customer usage for the year ended december 31 2014  increased from the same period last year primarily due to colder weather compared to the prior year while historically rate design at the distribution level has been structured such that a large portion of cost recovery is based upon throughput rather than in a fixed charge operating costs are largely incurred on a fixed basis and do not fluctuate due to changes in customer usage as a result the nisource ldcs have pursued changes in rate design to more effectively match recoveries with costs incurred each of the states in which the nisource ldcs operate has different requirements regarding the procedure for establishing changes to rate design columbia of ohio restructured its rate design through a base rate proceeding and has adopted a “decoupled” rate design

which more closely links the recovery of fixed costs with fixed charges columbia of massachusetts and columbia of virginia received regulatory approval of decoupling mechanisms which adjust revenues to an approved benchmark level through a volumetric adjustment factor columbia of maryland has received regulatory approval to implement a residential class revenue normalization adjustment a decoupling mechanism whereby monthly revenues that exceed or fall short of approved levels are reconciled in subsequent months in a prior base rate proceeding columbia of pennsylvania implemented a residential weather normalization adjustment charge in a prior base rate proceeding nipsco implemented a higher fixed customer charge for residential and small customer classes moving toward full straight fixed variable rate design 

environmental matters 

currently various environmental matters impact the gas distribution operations segment as of december 31 2014  reserves have been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions refer to note 18d “environmental matters” in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the gas distribution operations segment 

springfield ma incident 

on november 23 2012 while columbia of massachusetts was investigating the source of an odor of gas at a service location in springfield massachusetts a gas service line was pierced and an explosion occurred while this explosion impacted multiple buildings and resulted in several injuries no life threatening injuries or fatalities have been reported the massachusetts dpu has concluded its investigation columbia of massachusetts is fully cooperating with the occupational safety  health administration in its investigation of this incident columbia of massachusetts believes any costs associated with damages injuries and other losses related to this incident are substantially covered by insurance any amounts not covered by insurance are not expected to have a material impact on nisources consolidated financial statements 

weather 

in general nisource calculates the weather related revenue variance based on changing customer demand driven by weather variance from normal heating degreedays normal is evaluated using heating degree days across the nisource distribution region while the temperature base for measuring heating degree days ie the estimated average daily temperature at which heating load begins varies slightly across the region the nisource composite measurement is based on 65 degrees nisource composite heating degree days reported do not directly correlate to the weather related dollar impact on the results of gas distribution operations heating degree days experienced during different times of the year or in different operating locations may have more or less impact on volume and dollars depending on when and where they occur when the detailed results are combined for reporting there may be weather related dollar impacts on operations when there is not an apparent or significant change in the aggregated nisource composite heating degreeday comparison 

weather in the gas distribution operations service territories for 2014 was about 10 colder than normal and was about 8 colder than 2013 increasing net revenues by approximately 18 million for the year ended december 31 2014  compared to 2013 

weather in the gas distribution operations service territories for 2013 was about 2 colder than normal and was about 19 colder than 2012 increasing net revenues by approximately 48 million for the year ended december 31 2013 compared to 2012 

throughput 

total volumes sold and transported for the year ended december 31 2014  were 10425  mmdth compared to 10105  mmdth for 2013 this increase is primarily attributable to colder weather compared to the prior year 

total volumes sold and transported for the year ended december 31 2013 were 10105  mmdth compared to 9227  mmdth for 2012 this increase is primarily attributable to colder weather experienced in 2013 compared to 2012 

nisource throughput reported does not directly correlate to the results of gas distribution operations due to rate design

net revenues 

net revenues for 2014 were 18312 million an increase of 1971 million from the same period in 2013 the increase in net revenues is due primarily to an increase of 934 million for regulatory and service programs including the impacts of the rate settlement in 2013 at columbia of pennsylvania the rate case at columbia of massachusetts as well as the implementation of rates under columbia of ohios approved infrastructure replacement program furthermore there was an increase in regulatory and tax trackers which are offset in expense of 492 million and the effects of colder weather of 184 million additionally there was higher commercial residential and industrial usage of 146 million an increase in large customer revenue of 65 million higher revenue of 59 million due to increased customer count and an increase in offsystem sales of 56 million also there were higher net revenues from the recovery of storage inventory costs of 38 million and a settlement of 32 million at columbia of massachusetts in 2013 these increases were partially offset by a decrease of 56 million resulting from nipsco’s gcim 

net revenues for 2013 were 16341 million an increase of 1403 million from the same period in 2012 due primarily to an increase of 538 million for regulatory and service programs including the impact from the rate cases at columbia of pennsylvania and columbia of massachusetts and the implementation of rates under columbia of ohio’s approved infrastructure replacement program the effects of colder weather of 476 million increased trackers which are offset in expense of 187 million an increase in residential commercial and industrial usage of 108 million and higher revenue of 53 million due to an increase in residential and commercial customers 

at nipsco sales revenues and customer billings are adjusted for amounts related to under and overrecovered purchased gas costs from prior periods per regulatory order these amounts are primarily reflected in the “other” gross revenues statistic provided at the beginning of this segment discussion the adjustments to other gross revenues for the twelve months ended december 31 2014  and 2013  were a revenue increase of 342 million and a revenue decrease of 81 million respectively 

operating income 

for 2014 gas distribution operations reported operating income of 5370 million an increase of 916 million from the comparable 2013 period operating income increased as a result of higher net revenues as described above partially offset by increased operating expenses operating expenses were 1055 million higher than the comparable period reflecting increased regulatory and tax trackers which are offset in net revenues of 492 million higher employee and administrative expenses of 219 million primarily due to a growing workforce and increased it support and enhancements projects additionally there was increased depreciation of 162 million due to increased capital expenditures increased outside service costs of 137 largely due to columbia of pennsylvanias pipeline safety initiatives higher other taxes of 60 million and increased uncollectibles of 51 million these increases were partially offset by a decrease in environmental costs of 67 million 

for 2013 gas distribution operations reported operating income of 4454 million an increase of 541 million from the comparable 2012 period operating income increased as a result of higher net revenues as described above partially offset by increased operating expenses operating expenses increased 862 million due to higher employee and administrative expenses of 271 million primarily due to a growing workforce and increased it support and enhancement projects additionally there were increased regulatory and tax trackers which are offset in net revenues of 187 million higher depreciation of 115 million due to an increase in capital expenditures placed in service increased other taxes excluding trackers described above of 87 million higher outside services of 84 million increased environmental expense of 56 million and higher materials and supplies of 22 million

capital expenditures and other investing activities 

the table below reflects actual capital expenditures and other investing activities by category for 2012 2013 and 2014 and estimates for 2015 



capital expenditures in the columbia pipeline group operations segment in 2014 increased by 464 million compared to 2013 due to system growth and equity investments in the marcellus and utica shale areas the capital expenditure program and other investing activities in 2015 are projected to be approximately  10587 million  which is an increase of 2148 million over 2014 the increase from 2014 to 2015 is expected due to an increase in system growth and equity investments spend as a result of the current profile of identified growth projects in 2015 partially offset by a decrease in the modernization and maintenance spend attributed to advanced spend for the modernization program in 2014 

capital expenditures in the columbia pipeline group operations segment in 2013 increased by 3079 million compared to 2012 due to the modernization program and system growth and equity investments in the marcellus and utica shale areas 

nature of sales    

columbia transmission and columbia gulf compete for transportation customers based on the type of service a customer needs operating flexibility available capacity and price columbia gulf and columbia transmission provide a significant portion of total transportation services under firm contracts and derive a smaller portion of revenues through interruptible contracts with management seeking to maximize the portion of physical capacity sold under firm contracts 

firm service contracts require pipeline capacity to be reserved for a given customer between certain receipt and delivery points firm customers generally pay a “capacity reservation” fee based on the amount of capacity being reserved regardless of whether the capacity is used plus an incremental usage fee when the capacity is used annual capacity reservation revenues derived from firm service contracts generally remain constant over the life of the contract because the revenues are based upon capacity reserved and not whether the capacity is actually used the high percentage of revenue derived from capacity reservation fees mitigates the risk of revenue fluctuations within the columbia pipeline group operations segment due to changes in nearterm supply and demand conditions for the year ended december 31 2014 approximately 941 of the transportation revenues were derived from capacity reservation fees paid under firm contracts and 40 of the transportation revenues were derived from usage fees under firm contracts compared to approximately 931 and 50 respectively for the year ended december 31 2013 

interruptible transportation service is typically short term in nature and is generally used by customers that either do not need firm service or have been unable to contract for firm service these customers pay a usage fee only for the volume of gas actually transported the ability to provide this service is limited to available capacity not otherwise used by firm customers and customers

receiving services under interruptible contracts are not assured capacity in the pipeline facilities columbia pipeline group operations provides interruptible service at competitive prices in order to capture short term market opportunities as they occur and interruptible service is viewed by management as an important strategy to optimize revenues from the gas transmission assets for each of the years ended december 31 2014 and 2013 approximately 19 of the transportation revenues were derived from interruptible contracts 

environmental matters 

currently various environmental matters impact the columbia pipeline group operations segment as of december 31 2014 reserves have been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions refer to note 18d “environmental matters” in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the columbia pipeline group operations segment 

throughput 

columbia transmissions throughput consists of gas transportation service deliveries to ldc city gates to gas fired power plants other industrial customers or other interstate pipelines in its market area columbia transmissions market area covers portions of northeastern midatlantic midwestern and southern states as well as the district of columbia throughput for columbia gulf reflects transportation services for gas delivered through its mainline and laterals crossroads pipeline’s throughput comes from deliveries it makes to its customers and other pipelines that are located in northern indiana and ohio intersegment eliminations represent gas delivered to affiliated pipelines within the segment 

throughput for the columbia pipeline group operations segment totaled 18941  mmdth for 2014 compared to 17748  mmdth for the same period in 2013 this increase reflected increased marcellus natural gas production and favorable pricing conditions to thirdparty interconnects in the southeast region of the united states 

throughput for the columbia pipeline group operations segment totaled 17748  mmdth for 2013 compared to 17931  mmdth for the same period in 2012 the colder weather which drove a majority of the increase on the columbia transmission system was more than offset by the impact from increased production of appalachian shale gas that resulted in fewer deliveries being made by columbia gulf to columbia transmission at leach kentucky 

net revenues 

net revenues were 13469 million for 2014 an increase of 1675 million from the same period in 2013 the increase in net revenues is due primarily to higher regulatory trackers which are offset in expense of 884 million and increased demand margin revenue of 547 million primarily as a result of growth projects placed in service and new firm contracts additionally there was an increase in net revenues as a result of higher mineral rights royalty revenue of 226 million due to additional conveyances and increased thirdparty drilling activity 

net revenues were 11794 million for 2013 an increase of 1790 million from the same period in 2012 primarily due to higher regulatory trackers which are offset in expense of 1195 million the current period impacts of the 2012 customer settlement at columbia transmission which resulted in an increase in net revenues of 503 million higher demand margin and commodity revenue of 119 million from new growth projects placed into service and increased mineral rights royalty revenue and condensate revenue of 70 million these increases were partially offset by lower shorter term transportation services of 76 million

on june 10 2014 certain upgrade sponsors for both tuas filed a complaint at the ferc against nipsco regarding the multiplier stated in the tuas on june 30 2014 nipsco filed an answer defending the terms of the tuas and the just and reasonable nature of the multiplier charged therein and moved for dismissal of the complaint on december 8 2014 the ferc issued an order in response to the complaint finding that it is appropriate for nipsco to recover through the multiplier substantiated costs of ownership related to the tuas the ferc set for hearing the issue of what constitutes the incremental costs nipsco will incur but is holding that hearing in abeyance to allow for settlement nipsco will continue to monitor developments in this matter and does not believe the impact is material to the consolidated financial statements 

sales 

electric operations sales were 181863  gwh for the year ended 2014 an increase of 7183 gwh compared to 2013 the 41 increase is primarily attributable to an increase in industrial usage due to large industrial customers expanding plant operations and using less internal generation 

electric operations sales were 174680  gwh for the year ended 2013 an increase of 4597 gwh compared to 2012 the 27 increase is primarily attributable to an increase in wholesale usage as a result of increased off system sales opportunities

net revenues 

net revenues were 10637 million for 2014 an increase of 413 million from the same period in 2013 the increase in net revenues is due primarily to higher industrial usage of 219 million and an increase in the return on the environmental capital investment recovery of 198 million due to an increased plant balance eligible for recovery additionally there were increased net revenues of 59 million as a result of two electric transmission projects authorized by the miso and higher offsystem sales of 47 million these increases were partially offset by a decrease in transmission upgrade revenue of 65 million included in net revenue in the prior year and the effects of weather of 53 million 

net revenues were 10224 million for 2013 an increase of 86 million from the same period in 2012 primarily due to an increase in the return on the environmental capital investment recovery of 289 million due to an increased plant balance eligible for recovery higher industrial commercial and residential margins of 175 million transmission upgrade revenue of 62 million increased offsystem sales of 49 million higher revenue of 22 million due to an increase in commercial and residential customers and an increase in a rto recovery mechanism of 21 million which is offset in expense these increases were partially offset by lower environmental cost trackers which are offset in expense of 195 million decreased revenue related to emission allowances of 119 million the effects of colder weather of 100 million a decrease of 66 million related to the final reconciliation of the revenue credit recorded in 2012 and higher fuel handling costs of 43 million 

at nipsco sales revenues and customer billings are adjusted for amounts related to under and overrecovered purchased fuel costs from prior periods per regulatory order these amounts are primarily reflected in the “other” gross revenues statistic provided at the beginning of this segment discussion the adjustment to other gross revenues for the twelve months ended december 31 2014 and 2013 were a revenue decrease of 255 million and a revenue increase of 47 million respectively

corporate and other operations 

during the first quarter of 2010 nisource made the decision to wind down its unregulated natural gas marketing activities as a part of the company’s longterm strategy of focusing on its core regulated business on september 1 2013 nisource sold the commercial and industrial natural gas portfolio of its unregulated natural gas marketing business the sale included the physical contracts and associated financial hedges that comprise the portfolio as well as the gas inventory and customer deposits of the business 

divestiture of noncore assets

business strategy 

nisource focuses its business strategy on its core rateregulated assetbased businesses with most of its operating income generated from the rateregulated businesses with one of the nation’s largest natural gas pipelines one of the largest natural gas distribution networks east of the rocky mountains and one of the nation’s largest natural gas storage networks nisource operates throughout the energyintensive corridor that extends from the supply areas in the gulf coast through the consumption centers in the midwest midatlantic new england and northeast this corridor includes over 40 of the nation’s population and close to 50 of its natural gas consumption nisource continues to position its assets to meet the corridor’s growing energy needs 

competition and changes in the regulatory environment 

the regulatory frameworks applicable to nisource’s operations at both the state and federal levels continue to evolve these changes have had and will continue to have an impact on nisource’s operations structure and profitability management continually seeks new ways to be more competitive and profitable in this changing environment including providing gas customers with increased choices for products and services 

natural gas competition  open access to natural gas supplies over interstate pipelines and the deregulation of the commodity price of gas has led to tremendous change in the energy markets ldc customers and marketers purchase gas directly from producers and marketers as an open competitive market for gas supplies has emerged this separation or “unbundling” of the transportation and other services offered by pipelines and ldcs allows customers to purchase the commodity independent of services provided by the pipelines and ldcs the ldcs continue to purchase gas and recover the associated costs from their customers nisource’s gas distribution operations’ subsidiaries are involved in programs that provide customers the opportunity to purchase their natural gas requirements from third parties and use the nisource gas distribution operations’ subsidiaries for

 item 1a risk factors 

n i s ource  i nc  

there are many factors that could have a material adverse effect on nisource’s operating results financial condition and cash flows new risks may emerge at any time and nisource cannot predict those risks or estimate the extent to which they may affect financial performance each of the risks described below could adversely impact the value of nisource’s securities 

nisource has substantial indebtedness which could adversely affect its financial condition 

nisource had total consolidated indebtedness of 88340 million outstanding as of december 31 2013 the substantial indebtedness could have important consequences to investors for example it could 

  

 some of nisource’s debt obligations contain financial covenants related to debttocapital ratios and crossdefault provisions nisource’s failure to comply with any of these covenants could result in an event of default which if not cured or waived could result in the acceleration of outstanding debt obligations additionally a drop in nisource’s credit rating could adversely impact the cost for nisource to issue new debt securities 

a drop in nisource’s credit rating could adversely impact nisource’s liquidity 

on january 31 2014 moodys investors service upgraded the senior unsecured rating for nisource to baa2 from baa3 and nisource’s commercial paper rating to p2 from p3 additionally the rating for nipsco was upgraded to baa1 from baa2 and the rating for columbia of massachusetts was affirmed at baa2 moodys outlook for nisource and all of its subsidiaries is stable on december 9 2013 fitch affirmed the senior unsecured ratings for nisource at bbb and the existing ratings of all other subsidiaries fitchs outlook for nisource and all of its subsidiaries is stable on february 25 2013 standard  poors affirmed the senior unsecured ratings for nisource and its subsidiaries at bbb standard  poors outlook for nisource and all of its subsidiaries is stable although all ratings continue to be investment grade a downgrade by standard  poors or fitch would result in a rating that is below investment grade 

certain nisource affiliates have agreements that contain “ratings triggers” that require increased collateral if the credit ratings of nisource or certain of its subsidiaries are rated below bbb by standard  poors or baa3 by moodys these agreements are primarily for insurance purposes and for the physical purchase or sale of power the collateral requirement that would be required in the event of a downgrade below the ratings trigger levels would amount to approximately 354 million  in addition to agreements with ratings triggers there are other agreements that contain “adequate assurance” or “material adverse change” provisions that could necessitate additional credit support such as letters of credit and cash collateral to transact business 

these requirements combined with other potential negative effects on nisource’s liquidity in the event of a credit downgrade below an investment grade rating could have a material adverse effect on earnings potential and cash flows lastly a credit downgrade could adversely affect the availability and cost of capital needed to fund the growth investments which are a central element of the company’s longterm business strategy 

  

nisource may not be able to execute its growth strategy as planned 

because of changes in the business or regulatory environment nisource may not be able to execute its fourpart business plan as intended nisource’s commercial and regulatory initiatives may not achieve planned results levels of commercial growth and expansion of the gas transmission and storage business may be less than its plan has anticipated natural gas production activity including production facilitated by hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling could be less than anticipated which could adversely affect nisource’s gas transmission storage and midstream business expansion opportunities and therefore the actual results of nisource’s financial management of the balance sheet and process and expense management could deviate materially from planned outcomes in addition nisource’s growth plan relies on the continued view of natural gas as an economically and 

item 1a risk factors 

n i s ource  i nc  

ecologically attractive fuel any developments that cause natural gas no longer to be seen as a favored fuel could adversely affect our results of operations and growth prospects 

adverse economic and market conditions or increases in interest rates could reduce net revenue growth increase costs decrease future net income and cash flows and impact capital resources and liquidity needs 

while the national economy is experiencing some recovery from the recent downturn nisource cannot predict how robust the recovery will be or whether or not it will be sustained 

continued sluggishness in the economy impacting nisource’s operating jurisdictions could adversely impact nisource’s ability to grow its customer base and collect revenues from customers which could reduce net revenue growth and increase operating costs an increase in the interest rates nisource pays would adversely affect future net income and cash flows in addition nisource depends on debt to finance its operations including both working capital and capital expenditures and would be adversely affected by increases in interest rates if the current economic recovery remains slow or credit markets again tighten nisource’s ability to raise additional capital or refinance debt at a reasonable cost could be negatively impacted refer to note 16 “longterm debt” in the notes to consolidated financial statements for information related to outstanding longterm debt and maturities of that debt 

capital market performance and other factors may decrease the value of benefit plan assets which then could require significant additional funding and impact earnings 

the performance of the capital markets affects the value of the assets that are held in trust to satisfy future obligations under defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans nisource has significant obligations in these areas and holds significant assets in these trusts these assets are subject to market fluctuations and may yield uncertain returns which fall below nisource’s projected rates of return a decline in the market value of assets may increase the funding requirements of the obligations under the defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans additionally changes in interest rates affect the liabilities under these benefit plans as interest rates decrease the liabilities increase which could potentially increase funding requirements further the funding requirements of the obligations related to these benefits plans may increase due to changes in governmental regulations and participant demographics including increased numbers of retirements or changes in life expectancy assumptions ultimately significant funding requirements and increased pension expense could negatively impact nisource’s results of operations and financial position 

the majority of nisource’s net revenues are subject to economic regulation and are exposed to the impact of regulatory rate reviews and proceedings 

most of nisource’s net revenues are subject to economic regulation at either the federal or state level as such the net revenues generated by those regulated companies are subject to regulatory review by the applicable federal or state authority these rate reviews determine the rates charged to customers and directly impact revenues nisource’s financial results are dependent on frequent regulatory proceedings in order to ensure timely recovery of costs additionally the costs of complying with future changes in environmental laws and regulations are expected to be significant and their recovery through rates will be contingent on regulatory approval 

as a result of efforts to introduce marketbased competition in certain markets where the regulated businesses conduct operations nisource may compete with independent marketers for customers this competition exposes nisource to the risk that certain stranded costs may not be recoverable and may affect results of nisource’s growth strategy and cash flows 

  

nisource’s costs of compliance with environmental laws are significant the costs of compliance with future environmental laws and the recognition of environmental liabilities could impact cash flow and profitability 

nisource’s subsidiaries are subject to extensive federal state and local environmental requirements that among other things regulate air emissions water usage and discharges remediation and the management of chemicals hazardous waste solid waste and coal combustion residuals compliance with these legal obligations requires nisource to make expenditures for installation of pollution control equipment remediation environmental monitoring emissions fees and permits at many of nisource’s facilities these expenditures are significant and nisource expects that they will continue to be significant in the future furthermore if nisource’s subsidiaries fail to comply with environmental laws and regulations or cause harm to the environment or persons even if caused by factors beyond nisource’s control that failure or harm may result in the assessment of civil or criminal penalties and damages against nisource and its subsidiaries 

item 1a risk factors 

n i s ource  i nc  

existing environmental laws and regulations may be revised and new laws and regulations seeking to protect the environment may be adopted or become applicable to nisource’s subsidiaries revised or additional laws and regulations could result in significant additional expense and operating restrictions on nisource’s facilities or increased compliance costs which may not be fully recoverable from customers and would therefore reduce net income moreover such costs could materially affect the continued economic viability of one or more of nisource’s facilities 

because nisource’s operations deal with natural gas and coal fossil fuels emissions of ghgs are an expected aspect of the business while nisource attempts to reduce ghg emissions through efficiency programs leak detection and other programs ghg emissions cannot be entirely eliminated the current administration has made it clear that it is focused on reducing ghg emissions through legislation andor regulation imposing statutory or regulatory restrictions andor costs on ghg emissions could increase nisource’s cost of producing energy which could impact customer demand or nisource’s profitability compliance costs associated with these requirements could also affect nisource’s cash flow the cost impact of any new or amended ghg legislation or regulations would depend upon the specific requirements enacted and cannot be determined at this time 

even in instances where legal and regulatory requirements are already known the original estimates for cleanup and environmental capital projects can differ materially from the amount ultimately expended the actual future expenditures depend on many factors including the nature and extent of contamination the method of cleanup the cost of raw materials contractor costs and the availability of cost recovery from customers changes in costs and the ability to recover under regulatory mechanisms could affect nisource’s financial position operating results and cash flows 

a significant portion of the gas and electricity nisource sells is used by residential and commercial customers for heating and air conditioning accordingly the operating results fluctuate depending on the weather and to a certain extent usage of gas or electricity 

energy sales are sensitive to variations in weather forecasts of energy sales are based on normal weather which represents a longterm historical average significant variations from normal weather could have and have had a material impact on energy sales additionally residential usage and to some degree commercial usage have shown to be sensitive to fluctuations in commodity costs for gas and electricity whereby usage declines with increased costs thus affecting nisource’s financial results lastly residential and commercial customers’ usage has shown to be sensitive to economic conditions and the impact of macroeconomic drivers such as unemployment consumption and consumer confidence which could also affect nisource’s financial results 

nisource’s business operations are subject to economic conditions in certain industries 

business operations throughout nisource’s service territories have been and may continue to be adversely affected by economic events at the national and local level where it operates in particular sales to large industrial customers may be impacted by economic downturns the us manufacturing industry continues to adjust to changing market conditions including international competition increasing costs and fluctuating demand for its products 

fluctuations in the price of energy commodities or their related transportation costs may have a negative impact on nisource’s financial results 

nisource’s electric generating fleet is dependent on coal and natural gas for fuel and its gas distribution operations purchase and resell much of the natural gas they deliver these energy commodities are vulnerable to price fluctuations and fluctuations in associated transportation costs hedging activities have been deployed in order to offset fluctuations in commodity supply prices and nisource relies on regulatory recovery mechanisms in the various jurisdictions in order to fully recover the costs incurred in operations however while nisource has historically been successful in recovery of costs related to such commodity prices there can be no assurance that such costs will be fully recovered through rates in a timely manner additionally increased gas and electricity costs could result in reduced demand from customers as a result of increased conservation activities 

nisource is exposed to risk that customers will not remit payment for delivered energy or services and that suppliers or counterparties will not perform under various financial or operating agreements 

nisource’s extension of credit is governed by a corporate credit risk policy involves considerable judgment and is based on an evaluation of a customer or counterparty’s financial condition credit history and other factors credit risk exposure is monitored by obtaining credit reports and updated financial information for customers and suppliers and by evaluating the financial status of its banking partners and other counterparties through the use of marketbased metrics such as credit default swap pricing levels and also through traditional credit ratings provided by the major credit rating agencies continued adverse economic conditions could increase credit risk and could result in a material adverse effect on nisource

n i s ource  i nc  

nisource has significant goodwill and definitelived intangible assets an impairment of goodwill or definitelived intangible assets could result in a significant charge to earnings 

in accordance with gaap nisource tests goodwill for impairment at least annually and reviews its definitelived intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable goodwill also is tested for impairment when factors examples of which include reduced cash flow estimates a sustained decline in stock price or market capitalization below book value indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable nisource would be required to record a charge in the financial statements during the period in which any impairment of the goodwill or definitelived intangible assets is determined negatively impacting the results of operations a significant charge could impact the capitalization ratio covenant under certain financing agreements nisource is subject to a financial covenant under its fiveyear revolving credit facility and its three year term loan which requires nisource to maintain a debt to capitalization ratio that does not exceed 70 a similar covenant in a 2005 private placement note purchase agreement requires nisource to maintain a debt to capitalization ratio that does not exceed 75 as of december 31 2013 the ratio was 600  

changes in taxation and the ability to quantify such changes could adversely affect nisource’s financial results 

nisource is subject to taxation by the various taxing authorities at the federal state and local levels where it does business legislation or regulation which could affect nisource’s tax burden could be enacted by any of these governmental authorities nisource cannot predict the timing or extent of such taxrelated developments which could have a negative impact on the financial results additionally nisource uses its best judgment in attempting to quantify and reserve for these tax obligations however a challenge by a taxing authority nisource’s ability to utilize tax benefits such as carryforwards or tax credits or a deviation from other taxrelated assumptions may cause actual financial results to deviate from previous estimates 

changes in accounting principles may adversely affect nisource’s financial results 

future changes in accounting rules and associated changes in regulatory accounting may negatively impact the way nisource records revenues expenses assets and liabilities these changes in accounting standards may adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations 

  

transportation and storage of natural gas as well as generation transmission and distribution of electricity involve numerous risks that may result in accidents and other operating risks and costs 

nisources gas distribution and gas transmission and storage activities as well as generation transmission and distribution of electricity involve a variety of inherent hazards and operating risks such as gas leaks downed power lines accidents including third party damages large scale outages and mechanical problems which could cause substantial financial losses in addition these risks could result in serious injury or loss of life to employees and the general public significant damage to property environmental pollution impairment of its operations adverse regulatory rulings and reputational harm which in turn could lead to substantial losses to nisource in accordance with customary industry practice nisource maintains insurance against some but not all of these risks and losses the location of pipelines and storage facilities or generation transmission substations and distribution facilities near populated areas including residential areas commercial business centers and industrial sites could increase the level of damages resulting from these risks the occurrence of any of these events could adversely affect nisources financial position and results of operations 

aging infrastructure may lead to increased costs and disruptions in operations that could negatively impact nisource’s financial results 

nisource has risks associated with aging infrastructure assets the age of these assets may result in a need for replacement a higher level of maintenance costs and unscheduled outages despite diligent efforts by nisource to properly maintain these assets through inspection scheduled maintenance and capital investment the failure to operate these assets as desired could result in nisource’s inability to meet firm service obligations adversely impact revenues and could result in increased capital expenditures and expenses which may not be fully recoverable from customers

climate change natural disasters acts of terrorism or other catastrophic events may disrupt operations and reduce the ability to service customers 

a disruption or failure of natural gas transmission storage or distribution systems or within electric generation transmission or distribution systems in the event of a major hurricane tornado terrorist attack or other catastrophic event could cause delays in completing sales providing services or performing other critical functions nisource has experienced disruptions in the past from hurricanes and tornadoes and other events of this nature the cost availability and sufficiency of insurance for these risks could adversely affect nisource’s results of operations financial position and cash flows 

there is also a concern that climate change may exacerbate the risks to physical infrastructure associated with heat and extreme weather conditions climate change and the costs that may be associated with its impacts have the potential to affect nisource’s business in many ways including increasing the cost nisource incurs in providing its products and services impacting the demand for and consumption of its products and services due to change in both costs and weather patterns and affecting the economic health of the regions in which nisource operates 

a cyberattack on any of nisources or certain third party computer systems upon which nisource relies may adversely affect its ability to operate 

nisource is reliant on technology to run its businesses which are dependent upon financial and operational computer systems to process critical information necessary to conduct various elements of its business including the generation transmission and distribution of electricity operation of its gas pipelines and storage facilities and the recording and reporting of commercial and financial transactions to regulators investors and other stakeholders any failure of nisource’s computer systems or those of its customers suppliers or others with whom it does business could materially disrupt nisource’s ability to operate its business and could result in a financial loss and possibly do harm to nisource’s reputation 

additionally nisources information systems experience ongoing often sophisticated cyberattacks by a variety of sources with the apparent aim to breach nisources cyberdefenses although nisource attempts to maintain adequate defenses to these attacks and works through industry groups and trade associations to identify common threats and assess nisources countermeasures a security breach of nisources information systems could i impact the reliability of nisources generation transmission storage and distribution systems and potentially negatively impact nisources compliance with certain mandatory reliability standards ii subject nisource to harm associated with theft or inappropriate release of certain types of information such as system operating information or information personal or otherwise relating to nisources customers or employees or iii impact nisources ability to manage nisources businesses 

nisources capital projects subject it to construction risks and natural gas costs and supply risks 

nisource’s columbia pipeline group operations continues to complete and advance customerdriven expansion projects across its system and develop its midstream business through gathering and processing activities primarily surrounding the marcellus and utica shale production area in the states of pennsylvania ohio and west virginia additionally nisource is executing on its comprehensive interstate natural gas pipeline modernization program these modernization projects include constructing or replacing pipelines and other facilities which subjects nisource to construction risks and risks that gas supplies may not be available some expansion projects may also be subject to risks related to fluctuation in construction and gas costs both modernization and expansion projects are reliant on the contractual performance of vendors and suppliers of materials and supplies and services nonperformance or underperformance could subject nisource to increased costs further nisource is subject to regulatory approval of various projects delays in this process could increase costs of the projects 

nisource competes for these projects with companies of varying size and financial capabilities including some that may have advantages competing for natural gas and liquid gas supplies as well as acquisitions and other business opportunities similarly nisource gas distribution operations is engaged in an intrastate natural gas pipeline modernization program to maintain system integrity and enhance service reliability and flexibility nipsco also is currently engaged in a number of capital projects including airquality related improvements to its electric generating stations as well as the construction of new transmission facilities as nisource undertakes these projects it may not be able to complete them on schedule or at the anticipated costs additionally nisource may construct or purchase some of these projects to capture anticipated future growth in natural gas production which may not materialize and may cause the construction to occur over an extended period of time nisource also may not receive material increases in revenue and cash flows until after the completion of the projects

sustained extreme weather conditions may negatively impact nisource’s operations 

nisource conducts its operations across a wide geographic area subject to varied and potentially extreme weather conditions which may from time to time persist for sustained periods of time despite preventative maintenance efforts persistent weather related stress on nisource’s infrastructure may reveal weaknesses in its systems not previously known to the company or otherwise present various operational challenges across all business segments although nisource makes every effort to plan for weather related contingencies adverse weather may affect its ability to conduct operations in a manner that satisfies customer expectations or contractual obligations the company endeavors to minimize such service disruptions but may not be able to avoid them altogether 

growing competition in the gas transportation and storage industries could result in the failure by customers to renew existing contracts 

as a consequence of the increase in competition and the shift in natural gas production areas customers such as ldcs and other end users may be reluctant to enter into longterm service contracts the renewal or replacement of existing contracts with nisource’s customers at rates sufficient to maintain current or projected revenues and cash flows depends on a number of factors beyond its control including competition from other pipelines gatherers the proximity of supplies to the markets and the price of and demand for natural gas the inability of nisource to renew or replace its current contracts as they expire and respond appropriately to changing market conditions could materially impact its financial results and cash flows 

nisource is a holding company and is dependent on cash generated by subsidiaries to meet its debt obligations and pay dividends on its common stock 

nisource is a holding company and conducts its operations primarily through its subsidiaries substantially all of nisource’s consolidated assets are held by its subsidiaries accordingly nisource’s ability to meet its debt obligations or pay dividends on its common stock is largely dependent upon cash generated by these subsidiaries in the event a major subsidiary is not able to pay dividends or transfer cash flows to nisource nisources ability to service its debt obligations or pay dividends could be negatively affected

results of operations 

the following information should be read taking into account the critical accounting policies applied by nisource as discussed in “other information” of this item 7 

income from continuing operations and net income 

for the year ended december 31 2013  nisource reported income from continuing operations of 4909 million  or 157  per basic share compared to 4088 million  or 140  per basic share in 2012  income from continuing operations for the year ended december 31 2011  was 3096 million  or 110  per basic share 

including results from discontinued operations nisource reported 2013  net income of 5321 million  or 170  per basic share 2012  net income of 4161 million  or 143  per basic share and 2011  net income of 2991 million  or 106  per basic share 

comparability of line item operating results was impacted by regulatory and tax trackers that allow for the recovery in rates of certain costs such as bad debt expenses therefore increases in these tracked operating expenses were offset by increases in net revenues and had essentially no impact on income from continuing operations an increase in operating expenses of 1187 million for the 2013 year was offset by a corresponding decrease to net revenues reflecting these tracked costs in the 2012 period a decrease in operating expenses of 34 million for trackers was offset by a corresponding decrease to net revenues reflecting recovery of these costs 

net revenues 

nisource analyzes the operating results using net revenues net revenues are calculated as revenues less the associated cost of sales excluding depreciation and amortization nisource believes net revenues is a better measure to analyze profitability than gross operating revenues since the majority of the cost of sales are tracked costs that are passed through directly to the customer resulting in an equal and offsetting amount reflected in gross operating revenues 

total consolidated net revenues for the year ended december 31 2013 were 38418 million  a 3278 million increase compared with 2012 net revenues increased primarily due to increased columbia pipeline group operations net revenues of 1790 million higher gas distribution operations net revenues of 1403 million and increased electric operations net revenues of 86 million

n i s ource  i nc  

 total consolidated net revenues for the twelve months ended december 31 2012 were 35140 million  a 665 million increase compared with 2011 net revenues increased primarily due to increased electric operations net revenues of 1300 million partially offset by lower gas distribution operations net revenues of 539 million and decreased columbia pipeline group operations net revenues of 52 million 

 expenses 

operating expenses were 27343 million  in 2013 an increase of 2282 million from the comparable 2012 period this increase was primarily due to an increase in operation and maintenance expenses of 2136 million higher depreciation and amortization of 154 million and increased other taxes of 129 million partially offset by an increase in the gain on sale of assets of 137 million the increase in operation and maintenance is due primarily to increased regulatory trackers which are offset in revenue of 1300 million higher employee and administrative costs of 605 million due primarily to greater labor expense due to a growing workforce timing of outages and maintenance and it support and enhancement projects increased outside services of 102 million software data conversion costs of 89 million and a marktomarket adjustment of corporate owned life insurance assets primarily in the prior year of 57 million these increases were partially offset by lower electric generation costs of 131 million as a result of the timing of planned and unplanned outages the increase in depreciation and amortization is primarily due to increased capital expenditures related to projects placed in service the increase in gain on the sale of assets is primarily from the sale of storage base gas of 111 million and conveyances of mineral rights of 73 million both at columbia pipeline group operations 

operating expenses were 25061 million  in 2012 a decrease of 416 million from the comparable 2011 period this decrease was primarily due to a decrease in operation and maintenance expenses of 418 million lower impairment charges of 206

n i s ource  i nc  

million and decreased other taxes of 54 million partially offset by an increase in depreciation and amortization of 262 million the decrease in operation and maintenance is due primarily to decreased environmental costs attributable to the 2011 mgp remediation refresh and a decrease in employee and administrative costs driven largely by a decrease in pension contributions at columbia pipeline group operations these decreases in operation and maintenance expenses were partially offset by increased miso fees which were previously deferred until the 2011 electric rate case which resulted in the expiration of the deferral higher outside services and increased regulatory trackers which are offset in revenue lower impairment costs are primarily due to the 147 million impairment related to lake erie land recorded in the fourth quarter of 2011 these decreases were partially offset by an increase in depreciation and amortization primarily as a result of the expiration of deferrals of depreciation expense for sugar creek as a result of the 2011 electric rate case and higher depreciation due to increased capital expenditures these increases were partially offset by lower depreciation and amortization as a result of the columbia transmission customer settlement 

equity earnings in unconsolidated affiliates 

equity earnings in unconsolidated affiliates were 359 million  in 2013 an increase of 37 million compared with 2012 equity earnings in unconsolidated affiliates primarily includes investments in millennium and hardy storage which are integral to the columbia pipeline group operations business equity earnings increased primarily from increased earnings at millennium 

equity earnings in unconsolidated affiliates were 322 million  in 2012 an increase of 176 million compared with 2011 equity earnings in unconsolidated affiliates includes investments in millennium and hardy storage which are integral to the columbia pipeline group operations business equity earnings increased primarily from increased earnings at millennium due to higher demand and commodity revenues 

other income deductions 

other income deductions in 2013 reduced income 3906 million  compared to a reduction of 4166 million  in 2012 the decrease in deductions is primarily due to an increase in other net of 225 million in 2013 compared to 2012 this increase is primarily attributable to a gain from insurance proceeds and afudc earnings interest expense of 4148 million was recorded in 2013 a decrease of 35 million compared to the prior year the decrease resulted from the maturity of 4203 million of longterm debt in march 2013 and 3150 million of longterm debt in november 2012 increased afudc rates and lower average shortterm borrowings partially offset by higher interest expense from the issuance of 500 million of longterm debt in october 2013 7500 million of longterm debt in april 2013 and 7500 million of longterm debt in june 2012 

other income deductions in 2012 reduced income 4166 million  compared to a reduction of 4381 million  in 2011 the decrease in other deductions is due to a loss on early extinguishment of debt of 539 million in the prior year also there was an increase in other net due primarily to an increase in afudc at nipsco these increases to other income were partially offset by increased interest expense of 415 million interest expense increased primarily due to the issuances of longterm debt of 4000 million in june 2011 5000 million in november 2011 2500 million in april 2012 7500 million in june 2012 and the expiration of the sugar creek deferral these increases were partially offset by the repurchase of 1253 million of the 2016 and 1247 million of the 2013 notes in november 2011 and lower shortterm borrowings and rates 

income taxes 

the effective income tax rates were 348  344  and 350  in 2013  2012  and 2011  respectively the change in the overall effective tax rate in 2013  versus 2012  and 2012  versus 2011  were minimal refer to note 11 income taxes in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of income taxes

liquidity and capital resources 

a significant portion of nisource’s operations most notably in the gas distribution gas transportation and electric businesses are subject to seasonal fluctuations in cash flow during the heating season which is primarily from november through march cash receipts from gas sales and transportation services typically exceed cash requirements during the summer months cash on hand together with the seasonal increase in cash flows from the electric business during the summer cooling season and external shortterm and longterm financing is used to purchase gas to place in storage for heating season deliveries and perform necessary maintenance of facilities nisource believes that through income generated from operating activities amounts available under its shortterm revolver commercial paper program longterm debt agreements and nisource’s ability to access the capital markets there is adequate capital available to fund its operating activities and capital expenditures in 2014  

operating activities 

net cash from operating activities for the year ended december 31 2013  was 14368 million  an increase  of 1613 million  from a year ago the increase in net cash from operating activities was primarily due to an increase in working capital from income tax receivables of 2559 million primarily due to a refund from the irs received in 2013 

net cash from operating activities for the year ended december 31 2012  was 12755 million  an increase of 4053 million from the prior year the increase in net cash from operating activities was primarily due to the decrease in pension and postretirement contributions of 510 million in 2012 compared to 4471 million in 2011 

pension and other postretirement plan funding  in 2013  nisource contributed 493 million  to its pension plans and 543 million  to its postretirement medical and life plans in 2014  nisource expects to make contributions of approximately 383 million  to its pension plans and approximately 391 million  to its postretirement medical and life plans at december 31 2013  nisource’s pension and other postretirement benefit plans were underfunded by 2609 million  and 2600 million  respectively

for 2013  the capital expenditures and certain other investing activities were 20460 million  an increase of 4609 million compared to 2012  this increased spending is mainly due to higher expenditures for the modernization program and system growth and equity investments in the marcellus and utica shale areas in the columbia pipeline group operations segment and increased spending in the gas distribution operations segment due to increased spending on infrastructure replacement programs capital spending in the electric operations segment in 2013 was comparable to 2012 due to continued spending on the environmental tracker capital projects in the generation fleet

all derivatives classified as hedges are assessed for hedge effectiveness with any components determined to be ineffective charged to earnings or classified as regulatory assets or liabilities as appropriate during 2013  and 2012  no income was recognized in earnings due to the ineffectiveness of derivative instruments being accounted for as hedges 

refer to note 9 “risk management activities” in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information on nisource’s various derivative programs for managing commodity price risk 

nisource subsidiaries are required to make cash margin deposits with their brokers to cover actual and potential losses in the value of outstanding exchange traded derivative contracts the amount of these deposits which are reflected in nisource’s restricted cash balance may fluctuate significantly during periods of high volatility in the energy commodity markets 

interest rate risk 

nisource is exposed to interest rate risk as a result of changes in interest rates on borrowings under its revolving credit agreement term loan commercial paper program and accounts receivable programs which have interest rates that are indexed to shortterm market interest rates nisource is also exposed to interest rate risk due to changes in interest rates on fixedtovariable interest rate swaps that hedge the fair value of longterm debt based upon average borrowings and debt obligations subject to fluctuations in shortterm market interest rates an increase or decrease in shortterm interest rates of 100 basis points 1 would have increased or decreased interest expense by 142 million  for the years 2013  and 2012  respectively 

contemporaneously with the issuance on september 16 2005 of 10 billion of 525 and 545 notes maturing september 15 2017 and 2020 respectively nisource finance settled 900 million of forward starting interest rate swap agreements with six counterparties nisource paid an aggregate settlement payment of 355 million which is being amortized as an increase to interest expense over the term of the underlying debt resulting in an effective interest rate of 567 and 588 respectively 

  

on july 22 2003 nisource finance entered into fixedtovariable interest rate swap agreements in a notional amount of 500 million with four counterparties which will expire on july 15 2014 nisource finance receives payments based upon a fixed 540 interest rate and pays a floating interest amount based on us 6month bba libor plus an average of 078 per annum there was no exchange of premium at the initial date of the swaps 

as of december 31 2013  825 million of nisource finance’s existing longterm debt is subject to fluctuations in interest rates as a result of the fixedtovariable interest rate swap transactions that reprice every six months in january and july and the 3250 million term loan which reprices monthly based on 1month bba libor plus a credit spread effective with moodys credit rating upgrade on january 31 2014 nisources credit spread on the term loan is 100 per annum

credit risk 

due to the nature of the industry credit risk is embedded in many of nisource’s business activities nisource’s extension of credit is governed by a corporate credit risk policy in addition risk management committee guidelines are in place which document management approval levels for credit limits evaluation of creditworthiness and credit risk mitigation efforts exposures to credit risks are monitored by the corporate credit risk function which is independent of commercial operations credit risk arises due to the possibility that a customer supplier or counterparty will not be able or willing to fulfill its obligations on a transaction on or before the settlement date for forward commodity contracts credit risk arises when counterparties are obligated to deliver or purchase defined commodity units of gas or power to nisource at a future date per execution of contractual terms and conditions exposure to credit risk is measured in terms of both current obligations and the market value of forward positions net of any posted collateral such as cash letters of credit and qualified guarantees of support 

nisource closely monitors the financial status of its banking credit providers and interest rate swap counterparties nisource evaluates the financial status of its banking partners through the use of marketbased metrics such as credit default swap pricing levels and also through traditional credit ratings provided by the major credit rating agencies 

fair value measurement 

nisource measures certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value the level of the fair value hierarchy disclosed is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement nisource’s financial assets and liabilities include price risk assets and liabilities availableforsale securities and a deferred compensation plan obligation 

exchangetraded derivative contracts are generally based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets and are classified within level 1 these financial assets and liabilities are secured with cash on deposit with the exchange therefore nonperformance risk has not been incorporated into these valuations certain nonexchangetraded derivatives are valued using broker or overthecounter online exchanges in such cases these nonexchangetraded derivatives are classified within level 2 nonexchangebased derivative instruments include swaps forwards and options in certain instances these instruments may utilize models to measure fair value nisource uses a similar model to value similar instruments valuation models utilize various inputs that include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active other observable inputs for the asset or liability and marketcorroborated inputs ie inputs derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means where observable inputs are available for substantially the full term of the asset or liability the instrument is categorized in level 2 certain derivatives trade in less active markets with a lower availability of pricing information and models may be utilized in the valuation when such inputs have a significant impact on the measurement of fair value the instrument is categorized in level 3 credit risk is considered in the fair value calculation of derivative instruments that are not exchangetraded credit exposures are adjusted to reflect collateral agreements which reduce exposures 

price risk management assets also include fixedtofloating interestrate swaps which are designated as fair value hedges as a means to achieve its targeted level of variablerate debt as a percent of total debt nisource uses a calculation of future cash inflows and estimated future outflows related to the swap agreements which are discounted and netted to determine the current fair value additional inputs to the present value calculation include the contract terms as well as market parameters such as current and projected interest rates and volatility as they are based on observable data and valuations of similar instruments the interestrate swaps are categorized in level 2 in the fair value hierarchy credit risk is considered in the fair value calculation of the interest rate swap

other information 

critical accounting policies 

nisource applies certain accounting policies based on the accounting requirements discussed below that have had and may continue to have significant impacts on nisource’s results of operations and consolidated balance sheets 

item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

n i s ource  i nc  

basis of accounting for rateregulated subsidiaries  asc topic 980 regulated operations  provides that rateregulated subsidiaries account for and report assets and liabilities consistent with the economic effect of the way in which regulators establish rates if the rates established are designed to recover the costs of providing the regulated service and if the competitive environment makes it probable that such rates can be charged and collected certain expenses and credits subject to utility regulation or rate determination normally reflected in income are deferred on the consolidated balance sheets and are recognized in income as the related amounts are included in service rates and recovered from or refunded to customers the total amounts of regulatory assets and liabilities reflected on the consolidated balance sheets were 16650 million  and 17300 million  at december 31 2013  and 21872 million  and 17649 million  at december 31 2012  respectively for additional information refer to note 8 “regulatory matters” in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

in the event that regulation significantly changes the opportunity for nisource to recover its costs in the future all or a portion of nisource’s regulated operations may no longer meet the criteria for the application of asc topic 980 regulated operations  in such event a writedown of all or a portion of nisource’s existing regulatory assets and liabilities could result if transition cost recovery is approved by the appropriate regulatory bodies that would meet the requirements under gaap for continued accounting as regulatory assets and liabilities during such recovery period the regulatory assets and liabilities would be reported at the recoverable amounts if unable to continue to apply the provisions of asc topic 980 regulated operations  nisource would be required to apply the provisions of asc topic 98020 discontinuation of rateregulated accounting  in management’s opinion nisource’s regulated subsidiaries will be subject to asc topic 980 regulated operations  for the foreseeable future 

certain of the regulatory assets reflected on nisource’s consolidated balance sheets require specific regulatory action in order to be included in future service rates although recovery of these amounts is not guaranteed nisource believes that these costs meet the requirements for deferral as regulatory assets regulatory assets requiring specific regulatory action amounted to 1507 million  at december 31 2013  if nisource determined that the amounts included as regulatory assets were not recoverable a charge to income would immediately be required to the extent of the unrecoverable amounts 

pensions and postretirement benefits  nisource has defined benefit plans for both pensions and other postretirement benefits the calculation of the net obligations and annual expense related to the plans requires a significant degree of judgment regarding the discount rates to be used in bringing the liabilities to present value longterm returns on plan assets and employee longevity among other assumptions due to the size of the plans and the longterm nature of the associated liabilities changes in the assumptions used in the actuarial estimates could have material impacts on the measurement of the net obligations and annual expense recognition for further discussion of nisource’s pensions and other postretirement benefits see note 12 “pension and other postretirement benefits” in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

goodwill  nisource’s goodwill assets at december 31 2013  were 36662 million  most of which resulted from the acquisition of columbia on november 1 2000 in addition nipsco gas distribution operations’ goodwill assets at december 31 2013  related to the purchase of northern indiana fuel and light in march 1993 and kokomo gas in february 1992 were 178 million  as required nisource tests for impairment of goodwill on an annual basis and on an interim basis when events or circumstances indicate that a potential impairment may exist nisource’s annual goodwill test takes place in the second quarter of each year and was most recently finalized as of may 1 2013 

nisource completed a quantitative step 1 fair value measurement of its reporting units during the may 1 2012 goodwill test the test indicated that the fair value of each of the reporting units that carry or are allocated goodwill substantially exceeded their carrying values indicating that no impairment existed under the step 1 annual impairment test for the current year a qualitative step 0 test was performed as of may 1 2013 nisource assessed various assumptions events and circumstances that would have affected the estimated fair value of the reporting units in its baseline may 1 2012 test the results of this assessment indicated that it is not more likely than not that its reporting unit fair values are less than the reporting unit carrying values and no impairments are necessary 

although there was no goodwill asset impairment as of may 1 2013 an interim impairment test could be triggered by the following actual earnings results that are materially lower than expected significant adverse changes in the operating environment an increase in the discount rate changes in other key assumptions which require judgment and are forward looking in nature or if nisource’s market capitalization stays below book value for an extended period of time no  impairment triggers were identified subsequent to may 1 2013 

during the first quarter of 2013 as part of the sale of the service plan and leasing business lines of its retail services business nisource allocated 100 million  of goodwill from columbia distribution operations to the sale and allocated 10 million  of

recently issued accounting pronouncements 

there are no recently issued accounting pronouncements which the company expects to have a current or prospective material impact on its consolidated financial statements or notes to the consolidated financial statements 

environmental matters 

nisource is subject to regulation by various federal state and local authorities in the areas of air quality water quality control of toxic substances and hazardous and solid wastes and other environmental matters nisource believes that it is in substantial compliance with those environmental regulations currently applicable to nisource’s business and operations refer to note 20d “environmental matters” in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding environmental matters 

bargaining unit contract 

as of december 31 2013 nisource had 8477 employees of whom 3318 were subject to collective bargaining agreements  agreements were reached with the respective unions whose collective bargaining agreements were set to expire during 2013 two additional collective bargaining contracts covering approximately 1945 employees are set to expire during 2014  

  

doddfrank financial reform act 

the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act “the act” was passed by congress on july 15 2010 and was signed into law on july 21 2010 the act among other things establishes a financial stability oversight council “fsoc” and a consumer financial protection bureau “cfpb” whose duties include the monitoring of domestic and international financial regulatory proposals and developments as well as the protection of consumers the fsoc may submit comments to the sec and any standardsetting body with respect to an existing or proposed accounting principle standard or procedure the act also creates increased oversight of the overthecounter “otc” derivatives markets requiring otc transactions in instruments defined as “swaps” under the new regulations to be cleared through a designated contract market or swap execution facility and cash margins to be posted for those transactions during 2012 the commodity futures trading commission “cftc” finalized most of the remaining key regulations under the act which started to go into effect in late 2012 in accordance with a schedule promulgated by the cftc nisource is not a “swap dealer” a “major swap participant” or a “financial entity” as defined under the regulations and therefore various exemptions from mandatory clearing and realtime reporting apply to most of nisources swap transactions while the act and the new regulations have had some impact on capital markets and derivatives markets generally nisource does not expect compliance with the act to have any material effect on its operations 

results and discussion of segment operations 

presentation of segment information 

operating segments are components of an enterprise for which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance the nisource chief executive officer is the chief operating decision maker 

nisource’s operations are divided into three primary business segments the gas distribution operations segment provides natural gas service and transportation for residential commercial and industrial customers in ohio pennsylvania virginia kentucky maryland indiana and massachusetts the columbia pipeline group operations segment offers gas transportation and storage services for ldcs marketers and industrial and commercial customers located in 16 northeastern midatlantic midwestern and southern states and the district of columbia along with unregulated businesses that include midstream services and development of mineral rights positions the electric operations segment provides electric service in 20 counties in the northern part of indiana

gas distribution operations 



competition 

gas distribution operations competes with investorowned municipal and cooperative electric utilities throughout its service area and to a lesser extent with other regulated natural gas utilities and propane and fuel oil suppliers gas distribution operations continues to be a strong competitor in the energy market as a result of strong customer preference for natural gas competition with providers of electricity is generally strongest in the residential and commercial markets of kentucky southern ohio central pennsylvania and western virginia where electric rates are primarily driven by lowcost coalfired generation in ohio and pennsylvania similar gas provider competition is also common natural gas competes with fuel oil and propane in the massachusetts market mainly due to the installed base of fuel oil and propanebased heating which over time has comprised a declining percentage of the overall market

market conditions 

during 2013 spot prices at the henry hub for the winter through december 2013 have primarily been in the 3360  4520dth range compared to prices in the 302  370dth range experienced during the winter through december 2012 

entering the 20132014 winter season national storage levels were 112 bcf below the prior year and 57 bcf above the 5 year average inventory levels based on 1172013 energy information administration storage report during the summer of 2013 prices ranged between 3270 and 4375dth which were higher than those prices experienced in the summer of 2012 

all nisource gas distribution operations companies have stateapproved recovery mechanisms that provide a means for full recovery of prudently incurred gas costs gas costs are treated as passthrough costs and have no impact on the net revenues recorded in the period the gas costs included in revenues are matched with the gas cost expense recorded in the period and the difference is recorded on the consolidated balance sheets as underrecovered or overrecovered gas cost to be included in future customer billings 

the gas distribution operations companies have pursued nontraditional revenue sources within the evolving natural gas marketplace these efforts include the sale of products and services upstream of the companies’ service territory the sale of products and services in the companies’ service territories and gas supply cost incentive mechanisms for service to their core markets the upstream products are made up of transactions that occur between an individual gas distribution operations company and a buyer for the sales of unbundled or rebundled gas supply and capacity the onsystem services are offered by nisource to customers and include products such as the transportation and balancing of gas on the gas distribution operations company system the incentive mechanisms give the gas distribution operations companies an opportunity to share in the savings created from such things as gas purchase prices paid below an agreed upon benchmark and its ability to reduce pipeline capacity charges with their customers certain gas distribution operations companies continue to offer choice opportunities where customers can choose to purchase gas from a third party supplier through regulatory initiatives in their respective jurisdictions 

capital expenditures and other investing activities 

the table below reflects actual capital expenditures and other investing activities by category for 2011 2012 and 2013 and estimates for 2014   



the gas distribution operations segment’s capital expenditures and other investing activities were  7908 million  in 2013 and are projected to be  8173 million  in 2014 capital expenditures for 2013 were higher than 2012 by approximately 1414 million primarily due to increased spending on infrastructure replacement projects the estimated 2014 capital expenditures are comparable to 2013 and continue to reflect spending on infrastructure replacement programs in ohio kentucky pennsylvania virginia maryland and massachusetts capital expenditures for 2012 were higher than 2011 by approximately 1100 million primarily due to increased spending on infrastructure replacement projects 

regulatory matters 

refer to note 8 “regulatory matters” in the notes to consolidated financial statements for information on significant rate developments and cost recovery and trackers for the gas distribution operations segment 

customer usage  increased efficiency of natural gas appliances and improvements in home building codes and standards has contributed to a longterm trend of declining average use per customer usage for the year ended december 31 2013 increased from the same period last year primarily due to colder weather compared to prior year while historically rate design at the distribution level has been structured such that a large portion of cost recovery is based upon throughput rather than in a fixed charge operating costs are largely incurred on a fixed basis and do not fluctuate due to changes in customer usage as a result the nisource ldcs have pursued changes in rate design to more effectively match recoveries with costs incurred each of the states in which the nisource ldcs operate has different requirements regarding the procedure for establishing changes to rate design columbia of ohio restructured its rate design through a base rate proceeding and has adopted a “decoupled” rate design which more closely links the recovery of fixed costs with fixed charges columbia of massachusetts and columbia of virginia

received regulatory approval of decoupling mechanisms which adjust revenues to an approved benchmark level through a volumetric adjustment factor columbia of maryland has received regulatory approval to implement a residential class revenue normalization adjustment a decoupling mechanism whereby monthly revenues that exceed or fall short of approved levels are reconciled in subsequent months in a prior base rate proceeding columbia of pennsylvania implemented a higher fixed residential customer charge in its 2010 rate case nipsco implemented a higher fixed customer charge for residential and small customer classes moving toward full straight fixed variable rate design this rate design was also incorporated in the settlement of the 2011 merger of the three indiana ldcs nipsco kokomo gas and northern indiana fuel and light 

environmental matters 

currently various environmental matters impact the gas distribution operations segment as of december 31 2013 reserves have been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions refer to note 20d “environmental matters” in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the gas distribution operations segment 

springfield ma incident 

on november 23 2012 while columbia of massachusetts was investigating the source of an odor of gas at a service location in springfield massachusetts a gas service line was pierced and an explosion occurred while this explosion impacted multiple buildings and resulted in several injuries no life threatening injuries or fatalities have been reported columbia of massachusetts is fully cooperating with both the massachusetts dpu and the occupational safety  health administration in their investigations of this incident columbia of massachusetts believes any costs associated with damages injuries and other losses related to this incident are substantially covered by insurance any amounts not covered by insurance are not expected to have a material impact on nisources consolidated financial statements 

weather 

in general nisource calculates the weather related revenue variance based on changing customer demand driven by weather variance from normal heating degreedays normal is evaluated using heating degree days across the nisource distribution region while the temperature base for measuring heating degreedays ie the estimated average daily temperature at which heating load begins varies slightly across the region the nisource composite measurement is based on 65 degrees nisource composite heating degreedays reported do not directly correlate to the weather related dollar impact on the results of gas distribution operations heating degreedays experienced during different times of the year or in different operating locations may have more or less impact on volume and dollars depending on when and where they occur when the detailed results are combined for reporting there may be weather related dollar impacts on operations when there is not an apparent or significant change in the aggregated nisource composite heating degreeday comparison 

weather in the gas distribution operations service territories for 2013 was about 2 colder than normal and was about 19 colder than 2012 increasing net revenues by approximately 48 million for the year ended december 31 2013 compared to 2012 

weather in the gas distribution operations service territories for 2012 was about 15 warmer than normal and was about 12 warmer than 2011 decreasing net revenues by approximately 37 million for the year ended december 31 2012 compared to 2011 

throughput 

total volumes sold and transported for the year ended december 31 2013 were 10105  mmdth compared to 9227  mmdth for 2012 this increase is primarily attributable to colder weather compared to the prior year 

total volumes sold and transported for the year ended december 31 2012 were 9227  mmdth compared to 9176  mmdth for 2011 this increase is primarily attributable to higher throughput to industrial customers due mainly to the improved economy partially offset by decreased throughput to residential and commercial customers as a result of warmer weather experienced in 2012 

nisource throughput reported does not directly correlate to the results of gas distribution operations

gas distribution operations continued 

net revenues 

net revenues for 2013 were 16341 million  an increase of 1403 million from the same period in 2012 due primarily to an increase of 538 million for regulatory and service programs including the impact from the rate cases at columbia of pennsylvania and columbia of massachusetts and the implementation of rates under columbia of ohio’s approved infrastructure replacement program the effects of colder weather of 476 million increased trackers which are offset in expense of 187 million an increase in residential commercial and industrial usage of 108 million and higher revenue of 53 million due to an increase in residential and commercial customers 

net revenues for 2012 were 14938 million  a decrease of 539 million from the same period in 2011 due primarily to lower regulatory and tax trackers which are offset in expense of 537 million and the effects of warmer weather of 369 million these decreases in net revenues were partially offset by an increase of 349 million for regulatory and service programs including the impact of new rates under columbia of ohios approved infrastructure replacement program and the 2011 rate case at columbia of pennsylvania 

at nipsco sales revenues and customer billings are adjusted for amounts related to under and overrecovered purchased gas costs from prior periods per regulatory order these amounts are primarily reflected in the “other” gross revenues statistic provided at the beginning of this segment discussion the adjustments to other gross revenues for the twelve months ended december 31 2013 and 2012 were a decrease of 81 million and an increase of 313 million respectively 

operating income 

for 2013 gas distribution operations reported operating income of 4454 million  an increase of 541 million from the comparable 2012 period operating income increased as a result of higher net revenues as described above partially offset by increased operating expenses operating expenses increased 862 million due to higher employee and administrative expenses of 271 million primarily due to a growing workforce and increased it support and enhancement projects additionally there were increased regulatory and tax trackers which are offset in net revenue of 187 million higher depreciation of 115 million due to an increase in capital expenditures placed in service increased other taxes excluding trackers described above of 87 million higher outside services of 84 million increased environmental expense of 56 million and higher materials and supplies of 22 million 

for 2012 gas distribution operations reported operating income of 3913 million  an increase of 149 million from the comparable 2011 period operating income increased due to lower operating expenses partially offset by lower net revenues described above operating expenses decreased 688 million due to lower regulatory and tax trackers which are offset in net revenue of 537 million and decreased environmental costs of 350 million primarily attributable to estimated mgp remediation incurred in 2011 additionally operating expenses declined due to decreased employee and administrative costs primarily pension of 35 million and a decline in uncollectibles of 25 million these decreases were partially offset by increased depreciation and amortization of 183 million as a result of an increase in capital expenditures higher outside services of 59 million and increased materials and supplies of 36 million

capital expenditures and other investing activities 

the table below reflects actual capital expenditures and other investing activities by category for 2011 2012 and 2013 and estimates for 2014 



capital expenditures in the columbia pipeline group operations segment in 2013  increased by 3079 million compared to 2012  due to the modernization program and system growth and equity investments in the marcellus and utica shale areas the capital expenditure program and other investing activities in 2014 are projected to be approximately  8073 million  which is an increase of 98 million over 2013  the increase from 2013  to 2014 is expected due to an increase in system growth and equity investments spend as a result of the current profile of identified growth projects in 2014 partially offset by a decrease in the modernization and maintenance spend attributed to advanced spend for the modernization program in 2013 capital expenditures for 2012 were higher than 2011 by approximately 1881 million due to system growth in the marcellus shale area 

nature of sales    

columbia transmission and columbia gulf compete for transportation customers based on the type of service a customer needs operating flexibility available capacity and price columbia gulf and columbia transmission provide a significant portion of total transportation services under firm contracts and derive a smaller portion of revenues through interruptible contracts with management seeking to maximize the portion of physical capacity sold under firm contracts 

firm service contracts require pipeline capacity to be reserved for a given customer between certain receipt and delivery points firm customers generally pay a “capacity reservation” fee based on the amount of capacity being reserved regardless of whether the capacity is used plus an incremental usage fee when the capacity is used annual capacity reservation revenues derived from firm service contracts generally remain constant over the life of the contract because the revenues are based upon capacity reserved and not whether the capacity is actually used the high percentage of revenue derived from capacity reservation fees mitigates the risk of revenue fluctuations within the columbia pipeline group operations segment due to changes in nearterm supply and demand conditions the following percentages exclude the impact of intrasegment revenues trackerrelated revenues and the 50 million refund recorded in the third quarter of 2012 resulting from the columbia transmission customer settlement for the year ended december 31 2013 approximately 931 of the transportation revenues were derived from capacity reservation fees paid under firm contracts and 50 of the transportation revenues were derived from usage fees under firm contracts compared to 914 and 57 respectively for the twelve months ended december 31 2012 

interruptible transportation service is typically short term in nature and is generally used by customers that either do not need firm service or have been unable to contract for firm service these customers pay a usage fee only for the volume of gas actually transported the ability to provide this service is limited to available capacity not otherwise used by firm customers and customers receiving services under interruptible contracts are not assured capacity in the pipeline facilities columbia pipeline group operations provides interruptible service at competitive prices in order to capture short term market opportunities as they occur and interruptible service is viewed by management as an important strategy to optimize revenues from the gas transmission assets for the year ended december 31 2013 and 2012 approximately 19 and 29 respectively of the transportation revenues were derived from interruptible contracts

adair county ky incident 

on february 13 2014 a gas pipeline owned by columbia gulf ruptured in adair county kentucky no fatalities or serious injuries were reported and there was no material impact to commercial operations on the columbia gulf system columbia gulf is investigating the cause of the rupture and will cooperate with the appropriate authorities in any further investigation inspection and testing columbia gulf believes any costs associated with damages injuries and other losses related to this incident are substantially covered by insurance any amounts not covered by insurance are not expected to have a material impact on nisource’s consolidated financial statements 

throughput 

columbia transmission provides transportation and storage services for ldcs natural gas producers and other customers across its system which covers portions of northeastern midatlantic midwestern and southern states and the district of columbia billed throughput for columbia transmission consists of deliveries off of its system excluding gas delivered to storage for later delivery billed throughput for columbia gulf reflects transportation services for gas delivered through its mainline and laterals crossroads pipeline’s throughput comes from deliveries it makes to its customers and other pipelines that are located in northern indiana and ohio intersegment eliminations represent gas delivered to affiliated pipelines within the segment 

throughput for the columbia pipeline group operations segment totaled 15451  mmdth for 2013 compared to 15951  mmdth for the same period in 2012 the colder weather which drove a majority of the increase on the columbia transmission system was more than offset by the impact from increased production of appalachian shale gas that resulted in fewer deliveries being made by columbia gulf to columbia transmission at leach kentucky 

throughput for the columbia pipeline group operations segment totaled 15951  mmdth for 2012 compared to 16357  mmdth in 2011 the decrease of 406 mmdth was primarily attributable to warmer winter weather in 2012 which drove a vast majority of the decrease on the columbia transmission system fewer deliveries were made on the columbia gulf system to columbia transmission at leach kentucky because of the impact from increased production of appalachian shale gas and the warmer winter weather the increase in shale gas from the appalachian haynesville and barnett shale areas has also led to an increase in nontraditional throughput on columbia gulf in the form of deliveries to other interstate pipelines at liquid market centers on the columbia gulf system 

net revenues 

net revenues were 11794 million  for 2013 an increase of 1790 million from the same period in 2012 primarily due to higher regulatory trackers which are offset in expense of 1195 million the current period impacts of the 2012 customer settlement at columbia transmission which resulted in an increase in net revenues of 503 million higher demand and commodity revenue of 119 million from new growth projects placed into service and increased mineral rights royalty revenue of 70 million these increases were partially offset by lower shorter term transportation services of 76 million 

net revenues were 10004 million  for 2012 a decrease of 52 million from the same period in 2011 primarily due to the customer settlement at columbia transmission which decreased net revenues by 817 million additionally there was a decrease in condensate revenue of 43 million and a settlement of 28 million during the second quarter of 2011 and lower retainage revenues of 24 million primarily due to reversal of gas retained reserves in the fourth quarter of 2011 these decreases were partially offset by increased regulatory trackers which are offset in expense of 486 million higher demand margin revenue of 219 million primarily as a result of growth projects placed into service an increase of 83 million from the impact of higher rates at columbia gulf an increase of 61 million from shorter term transportation services and higher mineral rights royalty revenue of 41 million 

  

operating income 

operating income was  4414 million  for 2013 an increase of 430 million from the comparable period in 2012 operating income increased as a result of higher net revenues as described above and increased equity earnings partially offset by higher operating expenses operating expenses increased by 1397 million primarily due to increased regulatory trackers which are offset in net revenues of 1195 million higher employee and administrative expenses of 190 million that included 85 million related to higher pension costs software data conversion costs of 89 million and higher depreciation of 76 million primarily due to increased capital expenditures related to projects placed in service these increases were partially offset by higher gains on the sale of assets of 180 million resulting from the sale of storage base gas and on conveyances of mineral interests equity earnings increased 37 million primarily from increased earnings at millennium

corporate and other operations 

during the first quarter of 2010 nisource made the decision to wind down its unregulated natural gas marketing activities as a part of the company’s longterm strategy of focusing on its core regulated business 

divestiture of noncore assets 

in recent years nisource sold certain businesses judged to be noncore to nisource’s strategy lake erie land a whollyowned subsidiary of nisource is pursuing the sale of the real estate assets it owns ndc douglas properties a subsidiary of nisource development company is in the process of exiting its low income housing investments nisource began marketing to sell the service plan and leasing business lines of its retail services business in 2012 the sale of these business lines closed in january 2013 nisource is also in the process of winding down its unregulated natural gas marketing business where gas financial contracts are utilized to economically hedge expected future gas purchases associated with forward gas agreements 

business strategy 

nisource focuses its business strategy on its core rateregulated assetbased businesses with most of its operating income generated from the rateregulated businesses with one of the nation’s largest natural gas pipelines one of the largest natural gas distribution networks east of the rocky mountains and one of the nation’s largest natural gas storage networks nisource operates throughout the energyintensive corridor that extends from the supply areas in the gulf coast through the consumption centers in the midwest midatlantic new england and northeast this corridor includes over 40 of the nation’s population and close to 50 of its natural gas consumption nisource continues to position its assets to meet the corridor’s growing energy needs 

competition and changes in the regulatory environment 

the regulatory frameworks applicable to nisource’s operations at both the state and federal levels continue to evolve these changes have had and will continue to have an impact on nisource’s operations structure and profitability management continually seeks new ways to be more competitive and profitable in this changing environment including providing gas customers with increased choices for products and services 

natural gas competition  open access to natural gas supplies over interstate pipelines and the deregulation of the commodity price of gas has led to tremendous change in the energy markets ldc customers and marketers purchase gas directly from producers and marketers as an open competitive market for gas supplies has emerged this separation or “unbundling” of the transportation and other services offered by pipelines and ldcs allows customers to purchase the commodity independent of services provided by the pipelines and ldcs the ldcs continue to purchase gas and recover the associated costs from their customers nisource’s gas distribution operations’ subsidiaries are involved in programs that provide customers the opportunity to purchase their natural gas requirements from third parties and use the nisource gas distribution operations’ subsidiaries for transportation services the gas transmission and storage operations compete for transportation customers based on the type of service a customer needs operating flexibility available capacity and price under tariff provisions

 item 1a risk factors 

n i s ource  i nc  

there are many factors that could have a material adverse effect on nisource’s operating results financial condition and cash flows new risks may emerge at any time and nisource cannot predict those risks or estimate the extent to which they may affect financial performance each of the risks described below could adversely impact the value of nisource’s securities 

nisource has substantial indebtedness which could adversely affect its financial condition 

nisource had total consolidated indebtedness of 81032 million outstanding as of december 31 2012 the substantial indebtedness could have important consequences to investors for example it could 

  

 some of nisource’s debt obligations contain financial covenants related to debttocapital ratios and crossdefault provisions nisource’s failure to comply with any of these covenants could result in an event of default which if not cured or waived could result in the acceleration of outstanding debt obligations additionally a drop in nisource’s credit rating could adversely impact the cost for nisource to issue new debt securities 

a drop in nisource’s credit rating could adversely impact nisource’s liquidity 

on december 11 2012 fitch affirmed the senior unsecured ratings for nisource at bbb and the existing ratings of all other subsidiaries fitchs outlook for nisource and all of its subsidiaries is stable on november 16 2012 moodys investors service affirmed the senior unsecured ratings for nisource at baa3 and the existing ratings of all other subsidiaries moodys outlook for nisource and all of its subsidiaries is stable on february 29 2012 standard  poors affirmed the senior unsecured ratings for nisource and its subsidiaries at bbb standard  poors outlook for nisource and all of its subsidiaries is stable although all ratings continue to be investment grade a downgrade by standard  poors moodys or fitch would result in a rating that is below investment grade 

certain nisource affiliates have agreements that contain “ratings triggers” that require increased collateral if the credit ratings of nisource or certain of its subsidiaries are rated below bbb by standard  poors or baa3 by moodys these agreements are primarily for insurance purposes and for the physical purchase or sale of power the collateral requirement that would be required in the event of a downgrade below the ratings trigger levels would amount to approximately 278 million in addition to agreements with ratings triggers there are other agreements that contain “adequate assurance” or “material adverse change” provisions that could necessitate additional credit support such as letters of credit and cash collateral to transact business under columbia of pennsylvanias trade receivables sales program an event of termination occurs if nisources debt rating is withdrawn by either standard  poors or moodys or falls below bb or ba3 at either standard  poors or moodys respectively 

additionally as a result of nisource’s participation in certain derivative activities a credit downgrade could cause nisource to be required to post substantial collateral in support of past and current transactions these collateral requirements combined with other potential negative effects on nisource’s liquidity in the event of a credit downgrade below an investment grade rating could have a material adverse effect on earnings potential and cash flows lastly a credit downgrade could adversely affect the availability and cost of capital needed to fund the growth investments which are a central element of the company’s longterm business strategy 

  

nisource may not be able to execute its growth strategy as planned 

because of changes in the business or regulatory environment nisource may not be able to execute its fourpart business plan as intended nisource’s commercial and regulatory initiatives may not achieve planned results levels of commercial growth and expansion of the gas transmission and storage business may be less than its plan has anticipated and the actual results of nisource’s financial management of the balance sheet and process and expense management could deviate materially from planned outcomes 

item 1a risk factors 

n i s ource  i nc  

adverse economic and market conditions or increases in interest rates could reduce net revenue growth increase costs decrease future net income and cash flows and impact capital resources and liquidity needs 

while the national economy is experiencing some recovery from the recent downturn nisource cannot predict how robust the recovery will be or whether or not it will be sustained 

continued sluggishness in the economy impacting nisource’s operating jurisdictions could adversely impact nisource’s ability to grow its customer base and collect revenues from customers which could reduce net revenue growth and increase operating costs an increase in the interest rates nisource pays would adversely affect future net income and cash flows in addition nisource depends on debt to finance its operations including both working capital and capital expenditures and would be adversely affected by increases in interest rates if the current economic recovery remains slow or credit markets again tighten nisource’s ability to raise additional capital or refinance debt at a reasonable cost could be negatively impacted refer to note 16 “longterm debt” in the notes to consolidated financial statements for information related to outstanding longterm debt and maturities of that debt 

capital market performance and other factors may decrease the value of benefit plan assets which then could require significant additional funding and impact earnings 

the performance of the capital markets affects the value of the assets that are held in trust to satisfy future obligations under defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans nisource has significant obligations in these areas and holds significant assets in these trusts these assets are subject to market fluctuations and may yield uncertain returns which fall below nisource’s projected rates of return a decline in the market value of assets may increase the funding requirements of the obligations under the defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans additionally changes in interest rates affect the liabilities under these benefit plans as interest rates decrease the liabilities increase which could potentially increase funding requirements further the funding requirements of the obligations related to these benefits plans may increase due to changes in governmental regulations and participant demographics including increased numbers of retirements or changes in life expectancy assumptions ultimately significant funding requirements and increased pension expense could negatively impact nisource’s results of operations and financial position 

the majority of nisource’s net revenues is subject to economic regulation and is exposed to the impact of regulatory rate reviews and proceedings 

most of nisource’s net revenues are subject to economic regulation at either the federal or state level as such the net revenues generated by those regulated companies are subject to regulatory review by the applicable federal or state authority these rate reviews determine the energy rates charged to customers and directly impact revenues nisource’s financial results are dependent on frequent regulatory proceedings in order to ensure timely recovery of costs additionally the costs of complying with future changes in environmental laws and regulations are expected to be significant and their recovery through rates will be contingent on regulatory approval 

as a result of efforts to introduce marketbased competition in certain of the markets where the regulated businesses conduct operations nisource may compete with independent marketers for customers this competition exposes nisource to the risk that certain stranded costs may not be recoverable and may affect results of nisource’s growth strategy and cash flows 

  

nisource’s costs of compliance with environmental laws are significant the costs of compliance with future environmental laws and the recognition of environmental liabilities could impact cash flow and profitability 

nisource’s subsidiaries are subject to extensive federal state and local environmental requirements that among other things regulate air emissions water usage and discharges remediation and the management of chemicals hazardous waste solid waste and coal combustion residuals compliance with these legal obligations requires nisource to make expenditures for installation of pollution control equipment remediation environmental monitoring emissions fees and permits at many of nisource’s facilities these expenditures are significant and nisource expects that they will continue to be significant in the future furthermore if nisource’s subsidiaries fail to comply with environmental laws and regulations or cause harm to the environment or persons even if caused by factors beyond nisource’s control that failure or harm may result in the assessment of civil or criminal penalties and damages against nisource and its subsidiaries 

existing environmental laws and regulations may be revised and new laws and regulations seeking to protect the environment may be adopted or become applicable to nisource’s subsidiaries revised or additional laws and regulations could result in significant additional expense and operating restrictions on nisource’s facilities or increased compliance costs which may not 

item 1a risk factors 

n i s ource  i nc  

be fully recoverable from customers and would therefore reduce net income moreover such costs could materially affect the continued economic viability of one or more of nisource’s facilities 

because nisource’s operations deal with natural gas and coal fossil fuels emissions of ghgs are an expected aspect of the business while nisource attempts to reduce ghg emissions through efficiency programs leak detection and other programs ghg emissions cannot be entirely eliminated the current administration has made it clear that it is focused on reducing ghg emissions through legislation andor regulation imposing statutory or regulatory restrictions andor costs on ghg emissions could increase nisource’s cost of producing energy which could impact customer demand or nisource’s profitability compliance costs associated with these requirements could also affect nisource’s cash flow the cost impact of any new or amended ghg legislation or regulations would depend upon the specific requirements enacted and cannot be determined at this time 

even in instances where legal and regulatory requirements are already known the original estimates for cleanup and environmental capital projects can differ materially from the amount ultimately expended the actual future expenditures depend on many factors including the nature and extent of contamination the method of cleanup the cost of raw materials contractor costs and the availability of cost recovery from customers changes in costs could affect nisource’s financial position and cash flows 

a significant portion of the gas and electricity nisource sells is used by residential and commercial customers for heating and air conditioning accordingly the operating results fluctuate depending on the weather and to a certain extent usage of gas or electricity 

energy sales are sensitive to variations in weather forecasts of energy sales are based on normal weather which represents a longterm historical average significant variations from normal weather could have and have had a material impact on energy sales additionally residential usage and to some degree commercial usage have shown to be sensitive to fluctuations in commodity costs for gas and electricity whereby usage declines with increased costs thus affecting nisource’s financial results lastly residential and commercial customers’ usage has shown to be sensitive to economic conditions and the impact of macroeconomic drivers such as unemployment consumption and consumer confidence which could also affect nisource’s financial results 

nisource’s business operations are subject to economic conditions in certain industries 

business operations throughout nisource’s service territories have been and may continue to be adversely affected by economic events at the national and local level where it operates in particular sales to large industrial customers may be impacted by economic downturns the us manufacturing industry continues to adjust to changing market conditions including international competition increasing costs and fluctuating demand for its products 

fluctuations in the price of energy commodities or their related transportation costs may have a negative impact on nisource’s financial results 

nisource’s electric generating fleet is dependent on coal and natural gas for fuel and its gas distribution operations purchase and resell much of the natural gas they deliver these energy commodities are vulnerable to price fluctuations and fluctuations in associated transportation costs hedging activities have been deployed in order to offset fluctuations in commodity supply prices and nisource relies on regulatory recovery mechanisms in the various jurisdictions in order to fully recover the costs incurred in operations however while nisource has historically been successful in recovery of costs related to such commodity prices there can be no assurance that such costs will be fully recovered through rates in a timely manner additionally increased gas and electricity costs could result in reduced demand from customers as a result of increased conservation activities 

nisource is exposed to risk that customers will not remit payment for delivered energy or services and that suppliers or counterparties will not perform under various financial or operating agreements 

nisource’s extension of credit is governed by a corporate credit risk policy involves considerable judgment and is based on an evaluation of a customer or counterparty’s financial condition credit history and other factors credit risk exposure is monitored by obtaining credit reports and updated financial information for customers and suppliers and by evaluating the financial status of its banking partners and other counterparties through the use of marketbased metrics such as credit default swap pricing levels and also through traditional credit ratings provided by the major credit rating agencies continued adverse economic conditions could increase credit risk and could result in a material adverse effect on nisource

n i s ource  i nc  

nisource has significant goodwill and definitelived intangible assets an impairment of goodwill or definitelived intangible assets could result in a significant charge to earnings 

in accordance with gaap nisource tests goodwill for impairment at least annually and reviews its definitelived intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable goodwill would also be tested for impairment when factors examples of which include reduced cash flow estimates a sustained decline in stock price or market capitalization below book value indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable nisource would be required to record a charge in the financial statements during the period in which any impairment of the goodwill or definitelived intangible assets is determined negatively impacting the results of operations a significant charge could impact the capitalization ratio covenant under certain financing agreements a covenant in the fiveyear revolving credit facility requires nisource to maintain a debt to capitalization ratio that does not exceed 70 a similar covenant in a 2005 private placement note purchase agreement requires nisource to maintain a debt to capitalization ratio that does not exceed 75 as of december 31 2012 the ratio was 593 

changes in taxation and the ability to quantify such changes could adversely affect nisource’s financial results 

nisource is subject to taxation by the various taxing authorities at the federal state and local levels where it does business legislation or regulation which could affect nisource’s tax burden could be enacted by any of these governmental authorities nisource cannot predict the timing or extent of such taxrelated developments which could have a negative impact on the financial results additionally nisource uses its best judgment in attempting to quantify and reserve for these tax obligations however a challenge by a taxing authority nisource’s ability to utilize tax benefits such as carryforwards or tax credits or a deviation from other taxrelated assumptions may cause actual financial results to deviate from previous estimates 

changes in accounting principles may adversely affect nisource’s financial results 

future changes in accounting rules such as ifrs and associated changes in regulatory accounting may negatively impact the way nisource records revenues expenses assets and liabilities these changes in accounting standards may adversely affect its financial results 

  

transportation and storage of natural gas as well as generation transmission and distribution of electricity involve numerous risks that may result in accidents and other operating risks and costs 

nisources gas distribution and gas transmission and storage activities as well as generation transmission and distribution of electricity involve a variety of inherent hazards and operating risks such as gas leaks downed power lines accidents including third party damages large scale outages and mechanical problems which could cause substantial financial losses in addition these risks could result in serious injury or loss of life to employees and the general public significant damage to property environmental pollution and impairment of its operations which in turn could lead to substantial losses to nisource in accordance with customary industry practice nisource maintains insurance against some but not all of these risks and losses the location of pipelines and storage facilities or generation transmission substations and distribution facilities near populated areas including residential areas commercial business centers and industrial sites could increase the level of damages resulting from these risks the occurrence of any of these events not fully covered by insurance could adversely affect nisources financial position and results of operations 

aging infrastructure may lead to increased costs and disruptions in operations that could negatively impact nisource’s financial results 

nisource has risks associated with aging infrastructure assets the age of these assets may result in a need for replacement a higher level of maintenance costs and unscheduled outages despite diligent efforts by nisource to properly maintain these assets through inspection scheduled maintenance and capital investment the failure to operate these assets as desired could result in nisource’s inability to meet firm service obligations adversely impact revenues and could result in increased capital expenditures and expenses which may not be fully recoverable from customers

climate change natural disasters acts of terrorism cyberattacks or other catastrophic events may disrupt operations and reduce the ability to service customers 

a disruption or failure of natural gas transmission storage or distribution systems or within electric generation transmission or distribution systems in the event of a major hurricane tornado terrorist attack or other catastrophic event could cause delays in completing sales providing services or performing other critical functions nisource has experienced disruptions in the past from hurricanes and tornadoes and other events of this nature the cost availability and sufficiency of insurance for these risks could adversely affect nisource’s results of operations financial position and cash flows 

there is also a concern that climate change may exacerbate the risks to physical infrastructure associated with heat and extreme weather conditions climate change and the costs that may be associated with its impacts have the potential to affect nisource’s business in many ways including increasing the cost nisource incurs in providing its products and services impacting the demand for and consumption of its products and services due to change in both costs and weather patterns and affecting the economic health of the regions in which nisource operates 

additionally nisources information systems experience ongoing often sophisticated cyberattacks by a variety of sources with the apparent aim to breach nisources cyber defenses although nisource attempts to maintain adequate defenses to these attacks and works through industry groups and trade associations to identify common threats and assess nisources countermeasures a security breach of nisources information systems could i impact the reliability of nisources generation transmission storage and distribution systems and potentially negatively impact nisources compliance with certain mandatory reliability standards ii subject nisource to harm associated with theft or inappropriate release of certain types of information such as system operating information or information personal or otherwise relating to nisources customers or employees or iii impact nisources ability to manage nisources businesses 

nisources capital projects subject it to construction risks and natural gas costs and supply risks 

nisource gas transmission  storage operations continues to complete and advance customerdriven growth projects across its system primarily surrounding the marcellus and utica shale production area in the states of pennsylvania ohio and west virginia additionally nisource is beginning its comprehensive interstate natural gas pipeline modernization program these projects include constructing or purchasing pipelines and treatment and processing facilities which subjects nisource to construction risks and risks that gas supplies will not be available some projects may also be subject to risks related to fluctuation in gas costs nisource competes for these projects with companies of varying size and financial capabilities including some that may have advantages competing for natural gas and liquid gas supplies as well as acquisitions and other business opportunities similarly nisource gas distribution is engaged in an interstate natural gas pipeline modernization program to maintain system integrity and enhance service reliability and flexibility northern indiana also is currently engaged in a number of capital projects including airquality related improvements to its electric generating stations as well as the construction of new transmission facilities as nisource undertakes these projects it may not be able to complete them on schedule or at the anticipated costs additionally nisource may construct or purchase some of these projects to capture anticipated future growth in natural gas production which may not materialize and may cause the construction to occur over an extended period of time nisource also may not receive material increases in revenue and cash flows until after the completion of the projects 

  

sustained extreme weather conditions may negatively impact nisource’s operations 

nisource conducts its operations across a wide geographic area subject to varied and potentially extreme weather conditions which may from time to time persist for sustained periods of time despite preventative maintenance efforts persistent weather related stress on nisource’s infrastructure may reveal weaknesses in its systems not previously known to the company or otherwise present various operational challenges across all business segments although nisource makes every effort to plan for weather related contingencies adverse weather may affect its ability to conduct operations in a manner that satisfies customer expectations or contractual obligations the company endeavors to minimize such service disruptions but may not be able to avoid them altogether

growing competition in the gas transportation industry could result in the failure by customers to renew existing contracts 

as a consequence of the increase in competition in the industry and the shift in natural gas production areas end users and ldcs may be reluctant to enter into longterm service contracts the renewal or replacement of existing contracts with nisource’s customers at rates sufficient to maintain current or projected revenues and cash flows depends on a number of factors beyond its control including competition from other pipelines gatherers the proximity of supplies to the markets and the price of and demand for natural gas the inability of nisource to renew or replace its current contracts as they expire and respond appropriately to changing market conditions could materially impact its financial results 

nisource is a holding company and is dependent on cash generated by subsidiaries to meet its debt obligations and pay dividends on its common stock 

nisource is a holding company and conducts its operations primarily through its subsidiaries substantially all of nisource’s consolidated assets are held by its subsidiaries accordingly nisource’s ability to meet its debt obligations or pay dividends on its common stock is largely dependent upon cash generated by these subsidiaries in the event a major subsidiary is not able to pay dividends or transfer cash flows to nisource nisources ability to service its debt obligations or pay dividends could be negatively affected

results of operations 

the following information should be read taking into account the critical accounting policies applied by nisource as discussed in “other information” of this item 7 

income from continuing operations and net income 

for the year ended december 31 2012 nisource reported income from continuing operations of 4106 million  or 141  per basic share compared to 2948 million  or 105  per basic share in 2011 income from continuing operations for the year ended december 31 2010 was 2768 million  or 100  per basic share 

including results from discontinued operations nisource reported 2012 net income of 4161 million  or 143  per basic share 2011 net income of 2991 million  or 106  per basic share and 2010 net income of 2826 million  or 102  per basic share 

comparability of line item operating results was impacted by regulatory and tax trackers that allow for the recovery in rates of certain costs such as bad debt expenses therefore increases in these tracked operating expenses were offset by increases in net revenues and had essentially no impact on income from continuing operations a decrease in operating expenses of 34 million for the 2012 year was offset by a corresponding decrease to net revenues reflecting these tracked costs in the 2011 period a decrease in operating expenses of 404 million for trackers was offset by a corresponding decrease to net revenues reflecting recovery of these costs 

net revenues 

nisource analyzes the operating results using net revenues net revenues are calculated as revenues less the associated cost of sales excluding depreciation and amortization nisource believes net revenues is a better measure to analyze profitability than gross operating revenues since the majority of the cost of sales are tracked costs that are passed through directly to the customer resulting in an equal and offsetting amount reflected in gross operating revenues 

total consolidated net revenues for the year ended december 31 2012 were 35197 million  a 908 million increase compared with 2011 net revenues increased primarily due to increased electric operations net revenues of 1300 million partially offset by lower gas distribution operations net revenue of 536 million and decreased gas transmission and storage operations net revenues of 52 million 

 

 

 total consolidated net revenues for the twelve months ended december 31 2011 were 34289 million  a 215 million increase compared with 2010 net revenues increased primarily due to increased gas transmission and storage operations’ net revenues of 564 million and increased electric operations’ net revenues of 71 million partially offset by lower gas distribution operations’ net revenues of 215 million

 expenses 

operating expenses were 25092 million  in 2012 a decrease of 442 million from the comparable 2011 period this decrease was primarily due to a decrease in operation and maintenance expenses of 436 million lower impairment charges of 206 million and decreased other taxes of 62 million partially offset by an increase in depreciation and amortization of 262 million the decrease in operation and maintenance is due primarily to decreased environmental costs attributable to the 2011 mgp remediation refresh and a decrease in employee and administrative costs driven largely by a decrease in pension contributions at gas transmission and storage operations these decreases in operation and maintenance expenses were partially offset by increased miso fees which were previously deferred and the 2011 electric rate case resulted in the expiration of the deferral higher outside services and increased regulatory trackers which are offset in revenue lower impairment costs are primarily due to the 147 million impairment related to lake erie land recorded in the fourth quarter of 2011 these decreases were partially offset by an increase in depreciation and amortization primarily as a result of the expiration of deferrals of depreciation expense for sugar creek as a result of the 2011 electric rate case and higher depreciation due to increased capital expenditures these increases were partially offset by lower depreciation and amortization as a result of the columbia transmission customer settlement 

operating expenses were 25534 million  in 2011 an increase of 228 million from the comparable 2010 period this increase was primarily due to an increase in operation and maintenance expenses of 598 million higher impairment charges of 148 million and increased other taxes of 73 million the increase in operation and maintenance is due primarily to an increase in employee and administrative costs driven largely by an increase in pension contributions at gas transmission and storage operations as provided by its rate cases gaap pension expense is deferred to a regulatory asset and pension contributions are recorded to expense additionally during fourth quarter of 2011 nisource reviewed its current estimates for future environmental remediation costs related to the companys mgp sites following the review nisource revised its estimates based on expected remediation activities and experience with similar facilities and recorded 355 million of expense at subsidiaries for which environmental expense is not probable of recovery from customers higher impairment costs relate to the additional impairment of 147 million recorded in the fourth quarter of 2011 related to lake erie land these increases were partially offset by a decrease of 591 million in depreciation and amortization expense primarily as a result of the new depreciation rates at northern indiana as a result of the implementation of the gas rate case

equity earnings in unconsolidated affiliates 

equity earnings in unconsolidated affiliates were 322 million  in 2012 an increase of 176 million compared with 2011 equity earnings in unconsolidated affiliates includes investments in millennium and hardy storage which are integral to the gas transmission and storage operations business equity earnings increased primarily from increased earnings at millennium due to higher demand and commodity revenues 

equity earnings in unconsolidated affiliates were 146 million  in 2011 a decrease of 04 million compared with 2010 equity earnings in unconsolidated affiliates includes investments in millennium and hardy storage which are integral to the gas transmission and storage operations business equity earnings decreased primarily resulting from lower earnings from columbia transmission’s investment in millennium 

other income deductions 

other income deductions in 2012 reduced income 4166 million  compared to a reduction of 4381 million  in 2011 the decrease in other deductions is due to a loss on early extinguishment of debt of 539 million in the prior year also there was an increase in other net due primarily to an increase in afudc at northern indiana these increases to other income were partially offset by increased interest expense of 415 million interest expense increased primarily due to the issuances of longterm debt of 4000 million in june 2011 5000 million in november 2011 2500 million in april 2012 7500 million in june 2012 and the expiration of the sugar creek deferral these increases were partially offset by the repurchase of 1253 million of the 2016 and 1247 million of the 2013 notes in november 2011 and lower shortterm borrowings and rates 

other income deductions in 2011 reduced income 4381 million  compared to a reduction of 4852 million  in 2010 the increase in other income is due to a decrease in the loss on early extinguishment of debt of 428 million in the current year as a result of less redemptions of high interest debt in the fourth quarter of 2011 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2010 also there was a decrease in interest expense of 155 million interest expense decreased due to the repurchase of a portion of the 2016 and 2013 notes in november 2011 and a portion of the 2016 notes in december 2010 and a longterm debt maturity of 6818 million in november 2010 the benefits were partially offset by incremental interest expense associated with a swap maturity in november 2010 the issuance of 5000 million of longterm debt in november 2011 4000 million in june 2011 and 2500 million in december 2010 and higher average shortterm borrowings and rates these decreases were partially offset by an increase of 111 million in other net due primarily to an increase in charitable contributions in the current year 

income taxes 

the effective income tax rates were 344 348 and 319 in 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively the change in effective income tax rate was relatively flat in 2012 compared to 2011 the 29 increase in the overall effective tax rate in 2011 versus 2010 was primarily due to a tax rate change in indiana in 2011 and the 2010 rate settlements that resulted in the flow through of certain tax benefits in rates 

on may 12 2011 the governor of indiana signed into law house bill 1004 which among other things lowers the corporate income tax rate from 85 to 65 over four years beginning on july 1 2012 the reduction in the tax rate will impact deferred income taxes and tax related regulatory assets and liabilities recoverable in the rate making process in addition other deferred tax assets and liabilities primarily deferred tax assets related to indiana net operating loss carry forward will be reduced to reflect the lower rate at which these temporary differences and tax benefits will be realized in the second quarter of 2011 nisource recorded tax expense of 68 million to reflect the effect of this rate change the expense is largely attributable to the remeasurement of the indiana net operating loss at the 65 rate the majority of the company’s tax temporary differences are related to northern indiana’s utility plant the remeasurement of these temporary differences at 65 was recorded as a reduction of a regulatory asset 

the 2010 health care act includes a provision eliminating effective january 1 2013 the tax deductibility of retiree health care costs to the extent of federal subsidies received under the retiree drug subsidy program when the retiree drug subsidy was created by the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003 nisource recorded a deferred tax asset reflecting the exclusion of the expected future retiree drug subsidy from taxable income at the same time an offsetting regulatory liability was established to reflect nisource’s obligation to reduce income taxes collected in future rates asc topic 740 – income taxes requires the impact of a change in tax law to be immediately recognized in continuing operations in the income statement for the period that includes the enactment date in the first quarter of 2010 nisource reversed its deferred tax asset of 62 million related to previously excludable retiree drug subsidy payments expected to be received after january 1 2013 which was completely offset by the reversal of the related regulatory liability

the income in 2012 2011 and 2010 include activities associated with the service plan and leasing business lines of nisources retail services business partially offset by losses at cer and other former subsidiaries where nisource has retained certain liabilities during 2012 nisource began actively marketing the service plan and leasing business lines of its retail services business as of december 31 2012 the assets and liabilities of the business lines met the criteria to be classified as held for sale in accordance with gaap additionally the results of operations and cash flows are classified as discontinued operations for all periods presented the sale of the business lines closed in january 2013 resulting in gain from the disposal of discontinued operations of 363 million after taxes which will be recorded in the first quarter of 2013 

liquidity and capital resources 

a significant portion of nisource’s operations most notably in the gas distribution gas transportation and electric businesses are subject to seasonal fluctuations in cash flow during the heating season which is primarily from november through march cash receipts from gas sales and transportation services typically exceed cash requirements during the summer months cash on hand together with the seasonal increase in cash flows from the electric business during the summer cooling season and external shortterm and longterm financing is used to purchase gas to place in storage for heating season deliveries and perform necessary maintenance of facilities nisource believes that through income generated from operating activities amounts available under its shortterm revolver commercial paper program longterm debt agreements and nisource’s ability to access the capital markets there is adequate capital available to fund its operating activities and capital expenditures in 2013

net cash from operating activities for the year ended december 31 2012  was 12755 million  an increase  of 4053 million  from a year ago the increase in net cash from operating activities was primarily due to pension and postretirement contributions of 510 million  in 2012 compared to 4471 million  in 2011 

net cash from operating activities for the year ended december 31 2011 was 8702 million an increase of 1448 million from the prior year during 2011 gas price decreases and the collection of the 2010 underrecovered gas cost resulted in a 1275 million source of working capital related to underrecovered gas costs the 2196 million source of working capital associated with accounts receivable in 2011 was primarily due to warmer weather in 2011 these sources of working capital were partially offset by a decrease in working capital of 1418 million related to inventories primarily due to an increase in the weighted average cost rate additionally there was a use of working capital related to accounts payable of 1548 million in the current year as a result of a decrease in gas purchases due to warmer weather in december 2011 compared to december 2010

market risk disclosures 

risk is an inherent part of nisource’s energy businesses the extent to which nisource properly and effectively identifies assesses monitors and manages each of the various types of risk involved in its businesses is critical to its profitability nisource seeks to identify assess monitor and manage in accordance with defined policies and procedures the following principal risks that are involved in nisource’s energy businesses commodity market risk interest rate risk and credit risk risk management at nisource is a multifaceted process with oversight by the risk management committee that requires constant communication judgment and knowledge of specialized products and markets nisource’s senior management takes an active role in the risk management process and has developed policies and procedures that require specific administrative and business functions to assist in the identification assessment and control of various risks in recognition of the increasingly varied and complex nature of the energy business nisource’s risk management processes policies and procedures continue to evolve and are subject to ongoing review and modification 

various analytical techniques are employed to measure and monitor nisource’s market and credit risks including var var represents the potential loss or gain for an instrument or portfolio from changes in market factors for a specified time period and at a specified confidence level 

  

commodity price risk 

nisource is exposed to commodity price risk as a result of its subsidiaries’ operations involving natural gas and power to manage this market risk nisource’s subsidiaries use derivatives including commodity futures contracts swaps and options nisource is not involved in speculative energy trading activity 

commodity price risk resulting from derivative activities at nisource’s rateregulated subsidiaries is limited since regulations allow recovery of prudently incurred purchased power fuel and gas costs through the ratemaking process including gains or losses on these derivative instruments if states should explore additional regulatory reform these subsidiaries may begin providing services without the benefit of the traditional ratemaking process and may be more exposed to commodity price risk some of nisource’s rateregulated utility subsidiaries offer commodity price risk products to their customers for which derivatives are used to hedge forecasted customer usage under such products these subsidiaries do not have regulatory recovery orders for these products and are subject to gains and losses recognized in earnings due to hedge ineffectiveness 

all derivatives classified as hedges are assessed for hedge effectiveness with any components determined to be ineffective charged to earnings or classified as regulatory assets or liabilities as appropriate during 2012 and 2011 no income was recognized in earnings due to the ineffectiveness of derivative instruments being accounted for as hedges during the fourth quarter of 2011 nisource recorded a reserve of 226 million  on certain assets related to the winddown of the unregulated natural gas marketing business during 2012 nisource settled a majority of the contracts related to the reserve noted above and wrote off  438 million  of price risk assets additionally nisource has a notes receivable balance related to the settlements of  121 million  as of december 31 2012 

refer to note 9 “risk management and energy marketing activities” in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information on nisource’s various derivative programs for managing commodity price risk 

nisource subsidiaries are required to make cash margin deposits with their brokers to cover actual and potential losses in the value of outstanding exchange traded derivative contracts the amount of these deposits which are reflected in nisource’s restricted cash balance may fluctuate significantly during periods of high volatility in the energy commodity markets 

interest rate risk 

nisource is exposed to interest rate risk as a result of changes in interest rates on borrowings under its revolving credit agreement commercial paper program and accounts receivable programs which have interest rates that are indexed to shortterm market interest rates nisource is also exposed to interest rate risk due to changes in interest rates on its 250 million threeyear bank term loan which reprices monthly and on fixedtovariable interest rate swaps that hedge the fair value of longterm debt based upon average borrowings and debt obligations subject to fluctuations in shortterm market interest rates an increase or decrease in shortterm interest rates of 100 basis points 1 would have increased or decreased interest expense by 142 million  and 165 million  for the years 2012  and 2011  respectively 

contemporaneously with the pricing of the 525 notes and 545 notes issued september 16 2005 nisource finance settled 900 million of forward starting interest rate swap agreements with six counterparties nisource paid an aggregate settlement payment of 355 million which is being amortized as an increase to interest expense over the term of the underlying debt resulting in an effective interest rate of 567 and 588 respectively

on july 22 2003 nisource finance entered into fixedtovariable interest rate swap agreements in a notional amount of 500 million with four counterparties with an 11year term nisource finance receives payments based upon a fixed 540 interest rate and pays a floating interest amount based on us 6month bba libor plus an average of 078 per annum there was no exchange of premium at the initial date of the swaps in addition each party has the right to cancel the swaps on july 15 2013 

as of december 31 2012 5000 million of nisource finance’s existing longterm debt is subject to fluctuations in interest rates as a result of these fixedtovariable interest rate swap transactions 

credit risk 

due to the nature of the industry credit risk is embedded in many of nisource’s business activities nisource’s extension of credit is governed by a corporate credit risk policy in addition risk management committee guidelines are in place which document management approval levels for credit limits evaluation of creditworthiness and credit risk mitigation efforts exposures to credit risks are monitored by the corporate credit risk function which is independent of commercial operations credit risk arises due to the possibility that a customer supplier or counterparty will not be able or willing to fulfill its obligations on a transaction on or before the settlement date for forward commodity contracts credit risk arises when counterparties are obligated to deliver or purchase defined commodity units of gas or power to nisource at a future date per execution of contractual terms and conditions exposure to credit risk is measured in terms of both current obligations and the market value of forward positions net of any posted collateral such as cash letters of credit and qualified guarantees of support 

nisource closely monitors the financial status of its banking credit providers and interest rate swap counterparties nisource evaluates the financial status of its banking partners through the use of marketbased metrics such as credit default swap pricing levels and also through traditional credit ratings provided by the major credit rating agencies 

on october 31 2011 cash and derivatives brokerdealer mf global filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection mf global brokered nymex hedges of natural gas futures on behalf of nisource affiliates at the date of bankruptcy nisource affiliates had contracts open with mf global with settlement dates ranging from november 2011 to february 2014 on november 3 2011 these contracts were measured at a marktomarket loss of approximately 464 million nisource affiliates had posted initial margin to open these accounts of 69 million and additional maintenance margin for marktomarket losses for a total cash balance of 533 million within the first week after the filing at the direction of the bankruptcy court a transfer of assets was initiated on behalf of nisource affiliates to a courtdesignated replacement broker for future trade activity the existing futures positions were closed and then rebooked with the replacement broker at the new closing prices as of november 3 2011 initial margin on deposit at mf global of 57 million was transferred to the courtdesignated replacement broker the maintenance margin was retained by mf global to offset the loss positions of the open contracts on november 3 2011 nisource affiliates are monitoring the activity in the bankruptcy case and have filed a proof of claim at the court’s direction as of december 31 2012  nisource affiliates maintained a reserve for the 12 million difference between the initial margin posted with mf global and the cash transferred to the courtdesignated replacement broker as a loss contingency 

fair value measurement 

nisource measures certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value the level of the fair value hierarchy disclosed is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement nisource’s financial assets and liabilities include price risk assets and liabilities availableforsale securities and a deferred compensation plan obligation 

exchangetraded derivative contracts are generally based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets and are classified within level 1 these financial assets and liabilities are secured with cash on deposit with the exchange therefore nonperformance risk has not been incorporated into these valuations certain nonexchangetraded derivatives are valued using broker or overthecounter online exchanges in such cases these nonexchangetraded derivatives are classified within level 2 nonexchangebased derivative instruments include swaps forwards and options in certain instances these instruments may utilize models to measure fair value nisource uses a similar model to value similar instruments valuation models utilize various inputs that include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active other observable inputs for the asset or liability and marketcorroborated inputs ie inputs derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means where observable inputs are available for substantially the full term of the asset or liability the instrument is categorized in level 2 certain derivatives trade in less active markets with a lower availability of pricing information and models may be utilized in the valuation when such inputs have a significant impact on the measurement of fair value the instrument is categorized in level 3 credit risk is considered in the fair value calculation of derivative instruments that are not exchangetraded credit exposures are adjusted to reflect collateral agreements which reduce exposures

price risk management assets also include fixedtofloating interestrate swaps which are designated as fair value hedges as a means to achieve its targeted level of variablerate debt as a percent of total debt nisource uses a calculation of future cash inflows and estimated future outflows related to the swap agreements which are discounted and netted to determine the current fair value additional inputs to the present value calculation include the contract terms as well as market parameters such as current and projected interest rates and volatility as they are based on observable data and valuations of similar instruments the interestrate swaps are categorized in level 2 in the fair value hierarchy credit risk is considered in the fair value calculation of the interest rate swap 

refer to note 18 “fair value disclosures” in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on nisource’s fair value measurements 

market risk measurement 

market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices rates indices volatilities correlations or other market factors such as liquidity will result in losses for a specified position or portfolio nisource calculates a oneday var at a 95  confidence level for the gas marketing group that utilizes a variancecovariance methodology the daily market exposure for the gas marketing portfolio on an average high and low basis was 01 million  02 million  and zero  during 2012  respectively prospectively management has set the var limit at 04 million  for gas marketing exceeding this limit would result in management actions to reduce portfolio risk 

refer to “critical accounting policies” included in this item 7 and note 1u “accounting for risk management and energy marketing activities” and note 9 “risk management and energy marketing activities” in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of nisource’s risk management 

other information 

critical accounting policies 

nisource applies certain accounting policies based on the accounting requirements discussed below that have had and may continue to have significant impacts on nisource’s results of operations and consolidated balance sheets 

basis of accounting for rateregulated subsidiaries  asc topic 980 regulated operations  provides that rateregulated subsidiaries account for and report assets and liabilities consistent with the economic effect of the way in which regulators establish rates if the rates established are designed to recover the costs of providing the regulated service and if the competitive environment makes it probable that such rates can be charged and collected certain expenses and credits subject to utility regulation or rate determination normally reflected in income are deferred on the consolidated balance sheets and are recognized in income as the related amounts are included in service rates and recovered from or refunded to customers the total amounts of regulatory assets and liabilities reflected on the consolidated balance sheets were 21872 million  and 17649 million  at december 31 2012  and 21479 million  and 17759 million  at december 31 2011  respectively for additional information refer to note 8 “regulatory matters” in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

in the event that regulation significantly changes the opportunity for nisource to recover its costs in the future all or a portion of nisource’s regulated operations may no longer meet the criteria for the application of asc topic 980 regulated operations  in such event a writedown of all or a portion of nisource’s existing regulatory assets and liabilities could result if transition cost recovery is approved by the appropriate regulatory bodies that would meet the requirements under gaap for continued accounting as regulatory assets and liabilities during such recovery period the regulatory assets and liabilities would be reported at the recoverable amounts if unable to continue to apply the provisions of asc topic 980 regulated operations  nisource would be required to apply the provisions of asc topic 98020 discontinuation of rateregulated accounting  in management’s opinion nisource’s regulated subsidiaries will be subject to asc topic 980 regulated operations  for the foreseeable future 

certain of the regulatory assets reflected on nisource’s consolidated balance sheets require specific regulatory action in order to be included in future service rates although recovery of these amounts is not guaranteed nisource believes that these costs meet the requirements for deferral as regulatory assets regulatory assets requiring specific regulatory action amounted to 1462 million  at december 31 2012  if nisource determined that the amounts included as regulatory assets were not recoverable a charge to income would immediately be required to the extent of the unrecoverable amounts 

pensions and postretirement benefits  nisource has defined benefit plans for both pensions and other postretirement benefits the calculation of the net obligations and annual expense related to the plans requires a significant degree of judgment regarding the discount rates to be used in bringing the liabilities to present value longterm returns on plan assets and employee longevity 

item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

n i s ource  i nc  

among other assumptions due to the size of the plans and the longterm nature of the associated liabilities changes in the assumptions used in the actuarial estimates could have material impacts on the measurement of the net obligations and annual expense recognition for further discussion of nisource’s pensions and other postretirement benefits see note 12 “pension and other postretirement benefits” in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

goodwill  nisource’s goodwill assets at december 31 2012  were 36773 million  most of which resulted from the acquisition of columbia on november 1 2000 in addition northern indiana gas distribution operations’ goodwill assets at december 31 2012  related to the purchase of northern indiana fuel and light in march 1993 and kokomo gas in february 1992 were 188 million  as required nisource tests for impairment of goodwill on an annual basis and on an interim basis when events or circumstances indicate that a potential impairment may exist nisource’s annual goodwill test takes place in the second quarter of each year and was most recently finalized as of may 1 2012 the goodwill test utilized both an income approach and a market approach in performing the goodwill test nisource made certain required key assumptions such as longterm growth rates discount rates and fair market values 

  

these key assumptions required significant judgment by management which are subjective and forwardlooking in nature to assist in making these judgments nisource utilized thirdparty valuation specialists in both determining and testing key assumptions used in the analysis nisource based its assumptions on projected financial information that it believes is reasonable however actual results may differ materially from those projections nisource used discount rates of 560  for both columbia transmission operations and columbia distribution operations the step 1 goodwill impairment test resulted in the fair value of both columbia transmission operations and columbia distribution operations reporting units to be above carrying value by approximately 16430 million  and 16820 million  respectively 

goodwill at northern indiana gas distribution operations related to the acquisition of northern indiana fuel and light and kokomo gas of 188 million  was also tested for impairment as of may 1 2012 the income approach was used to determine the fair value of the northern indiana gas distribution reporting unit key assumptions in the income approach were a discount rate of 560  and a growth rate based on the cash flow from operations these cash flows factor in the regulatory environment and planned growth initiatives the step 1 goodwill impairment test resulted in the fair value of the northern indiana gas distribution reporting unit to be above the carrying value by 3560 million  

although there was no goodwill asset impairment as of may 1 2012 an interim impairment test could be triggered by the following actual earnings results that are materially lower than expected significant adverse changes in the operating environment an increase in the discount rate changes in other key assumptions which require judgment and are forward looking in nature or if nisource’s market capitalization stays below book value for an extended period of time no  impairment triggers were identified subsequent to may 1 2012

doddfrank financial reform act 

the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act “the act” was passed by congress on july 15 2010 and was signed into law on july 21 2010 the act among other things establishes a financial stability oversight council “fsoc” and a consumer financial protection bureau “cfpb” whose duties will include the monitoring of domestic and international financial regulatory proposals and developments as well as the protection of consumers the fsoc may submit comments to the sec and any standardsetting body with respect to an existing or proposed accounting principle standard or procedure the act also creates increased oversight of the overthecounter “otc” derivative market requiring certain otc transactions in instruments defined as “swaps” under the new regulations to be cleared through a clearing house and requiring cash margins to be posted for those transactions during 2012 the commodity futures trading commission cftc finalized most of its remaining key regulations under the act which started to go into effect in late 2012 in accordance with a schedule promulgated by the cftc under the cftc’s final rules very few of nisource’s transactions will be considered uncleared “swaps” to the extent any of nisources transactions come within the definition of a swap it is expected that nisource will qualify as an end user and therefore various exemptions from mandatory clearing and realtime reporting will apply to most such transactions while the act and the new regulations are expected to have some impact on capital markets and derivatives markets generally nisource does not expect the act to have any material effect on its operations 

results and discussion of segment operations 

presentation of segment information 

operating segments are components of an enterprise for which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance the nisource chief executive officer is the chief operating decision maker 

nisource’s operations are divided into three primary business segments the gas distribution operations segment provides natural gas service and transportation for residential commercial and industrial customers in ohio pennsylvania virginia kentucky maryland indiana and massachusetts the gas transmission and storage operations segment offers gas transportation and storage services for ldcs marketers and industrial and commercial customers located in northeastern midatlantic midwestern and southern states and the district of columbia the electric operations segment provides electric service in 20 counties in the northern part of indiana

competition 

gas distribution operations competes with investorowned municipal and cooperative electric utilities throughout its service area and to a lesser extent with other regulated natural gas utilities and propane and fuel oil suppliers gas distribution operations continues to be a strong competitor in the energy market as a result of strong customer preference for natural gas competition with providers of electricity is generally strongest in the residential and commercial markets of kentucky southern ohio central pennsylvania and western virginia where electric rates are primarily driven by lowcost coalfired generation in ohio and pennsylvania similar gas provider competition is also common gas competes with fuel oil and propane in the massachusetts market mainly due to the installed base of fuel oil and propanebased heating which over time has comprised a declining percentage of the overall market

market conditions 

during 2012 spot prices at the henry hub for the winter of 20122013 have primarily been in the 302  370dth range compared to prices in the 280  370dth range experienced during the winter of 20112012 

entering the 20122013 winter season national storage levels were 109 bcf below the prior year but 244 bcf ahead of the 5 year average inventory levels based on 1182012 energy information administration storage report during the summer of 2012 prices ranged between 204 and 301dth which were lower than those prices experienced in the summer of 2011 

all nisource gas distribution operations companies have stateapproved recovery mechanisms that provide a means for full recovery of prudently incurred gas costs gas costs are treated as passthrough costs and have no impact on the net revenues recorded in the period the gas costs included in revenues are matched with the gas cost expense recorded in the period and the difference is recorded on the consolidated balance sheets as underrecovered or overrecovered gas cost to be included in future customer billings 

the gas distribution operations companies have pursued nontraditional revenue sources within the evolving natural gas marketplace these efforts include the sale of products and services upstream of the companies’ service territory the sale of products and services in the companies’ service territories and gas supply cost incentive mechanisms for service to their core markets the upstream products are made up of transactions that occur between an individual gas distribution operations company and a buyer for the sales of unbundled or rebundled gas supply and capacity the onsystem services are offered by nisource to customers and include products such as the transportation and balancing of gas on the gas distribution operations company system the incentive mechanisms give the gas distribution operations companies an opportunity to share in the savings created from such things as gas purchase prices paid below an agreed upon benchmark and its ability to reduce pipeline capacity charges with their customers certain gas distribution operations companies continue to offer choice opportunities where customers can choose to purchase gas from a third party supplier through regulatory initiatives in their respective jurisdictions 

capital expenditures and other investing activities 

the table below reflects actual capital expenditures and other investing activities by category for 2010 2011 and 2012 and estimates for 2013 

  



the gas distribution operations segment’s capital expenditures and other investing activities were  6494 million  in 2012 and are projected to be  6552 million  in 2013 capital expenditures for 2012 were higher than 2011 by approximately 1100 million primarily due to increased spending on infrastructure replacement projects the estimated 2013 capital expenditures are comparable to 2012 and continue to reflect spending on infrastructure replacement programs in ohio kentucky pennsylvania virginia maryland and massachusetts capital expenditures for 2011 were higher than 2010 by approximately 1297 million primarily due to increased spending on infrastructure replacement projects 

regulatory matters 

refer to note 8 “regulatory matters” in the notes to consolidated financial statements for information on significant rate developments and cost recovery and trackers for the gas distribution operations segment 

customer usage  increased efficiency of natural gas appliances and improvements in home building codes and standards has contributed to a longterm trend of declining average use per customer in addition usage for the year ended december 31 2012 declined from the same period last year primarily due to warmer than normal weather while historically rate design at the distribution level has been structured such that a large portion of cost recovery is based upon throughput rather than in a fixed charge operating costs are largely incurred on a fixed basis and do not fluctuate due to changes in customer usage as a result the nisource ldcs have pursued changes in rate design to more effectively match recoveries with cost incurrence each of the states in which the nisource ldcs operate has different requirements regarding the procedure for establishing changes to rate design columbia of ohio restructured its rate design through a base rate proceeding and has adopted a “decoupled” rate design

which more closely links the recovery of fixed costs with fixed charges columbia of massachusetts and columbia of virginia received regulatory approval of decoupling mechanisms which adjust revenues to an approved benchmark level through a volumetric adjustment factor in its 2011 rate case columbia of pennsylvania implemented a higher fixed residential customer charge in its 2010 rate case northern indiana implemented a higher fixed customer charge for residential and small customer classes moving toward full straight fixed variable rate design this rate design was also incorporated in the settlement of the 2011 merger of the three indiana ldcs northern indiana kokomo gas and northern indiana fuel and light 

environmental matters 

currently various environmental matters impact the gas distribution operations segment as of december 31 2012 reserves have been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions refer to note 20d “environmental matters” in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the gas distribution operations segment 

springfield ma incident 

on november 23 2012 while columbia of massachusetts was investigating the source of an odor of gas at a service location in springfield massachusetts a gas service line was pierced and an explosion occurred while this explosion impacted multiple buildings and resulted in several injuries no life threatening injuries or fatalities have been reported columbia of massachusetts is fully cooperating with both the massachusetts dpu and the occupational safety  health administration in their investigations of this incident columbia of massachusetts believes any costs associated with damages injuries and other losses related to this incident are substantially covered by insurance any amounts not covered by insurance are not expected to have a material impact on nisources consolidated financial statements 

weather 

in general nisource calculates the weather related revenue variance based on changing customer demand driven by weather variance from normal heating degreedays normal is evaluated using heating degree days across the nisource distribution region while the temperature base for measuring heating degreedays ie the estimated average daily temperature at which heating load begins varies slightly across the region the nisource composite measurement is based on 65 degrees nisource composite heating degreedays reported do not directly correlate to the weather related dollar impact on the results of gas distribution operations heating degreedays experienced during different times of the year or in different operating locations may have more or less impact on volume and dollars depending on when and where they occur when the detailed results are combined for reporting there may be weather related dollar impacts on operations when there is not an apparent or significant change in the aggregated nisource composite heating degreeday comparison 

weather in the gas distribution operations service territories for 2012 was about 15 warmer than normal and was about 12 warmer than 2011 decreasing net revenues by approximately 37 million for the year ended december 31 2012 compared to 2011 

weather in the gas distribution operations service territories for 2011 was about 4 warmer than normal and was about 2 warmer than 2010 decreasing net revenues by approximately 6 million for the year ended december 31 2011 compared to 2010 

throughput 

total volumes sold and transported for the year ended december 31 2012 were 9227  mmdth compared to 9176  mmdth for 2011 this increase is primarily attributable to higher throughput to industrial customers due mainly to the improved economy partially offset by decreased throughput to residential and commercial customers as a result of warmer weather experienced in 2012 

total volumes sold and transported for the year ended december 31 2011 were 9176  mmdth compared to 8833  mmdth for 2010 this increase reflected higher throughput to industrial customers attributable mainly to the improved economy 

nisource throughput reported does not directly correlate to the results of gas distribution operations

sales and percentage of physical capacity sold    

columbia transmission and columbia gulf compete for transportation customers based on the type of service a customer needs operating flexibility available capacity and price columbia gulf and columbia transmission provide a significant portion of total transportation services under firm contracts and derive a smaller portion of revenues through interruptible contracts with management seeking to maximize the portion of physical capacity sold under firm contracts 

firm service contracts require pipeline capacity to be reserved for a given customer between certain receipt and delivery points firm customers generally pay a “capacity reservation” fee based on the amount of capacity being reserved regardless of whether the capacity is used plus an incremental usage fee when the capacity is used annual capacity reservation revenues derived from firm service contracts generally remain constant over the life of the contract because the revenues are based upon capacity reserved and not whether the capacity is actually used the high percentage of revenue derived from capacity reservation fees mitigates the risk of revenue fluctuations within the gas transmission and storage operations segment due to changes in nearterm supply and demand conditions the following percentages exclude the impact of the 50 million refund recorded in the third quarter of 2012 resulting from the columbia transmission customer settlement for the year ended december 31 2012 approximately 914 of the transportation revenues were derived from capacity reservation fees paid under firm contracts and 57 of the transportation revenues were derived from usage fees under firm contracts compared to approximately 917 and 61 respectively for the year ended december 31 2011 

interruptible transportation service is typically short term in nature and is generally used by customers that either do not need firm service or have been unable to contract for firm service these customers pay a usage fee only for the volume of gas actually transported the ability to provide this service is limited to available capacity not otherwise used by firm customers and customers receiving services under interruptible contracts are not assured capacity in the pipeline facilities gas transmission and storage operations provides interruptible service at competitive prices in order to capture short term market opportunities as they occur and interruptible service is viewed by management as an important strategy to optimize revenues from the gas transmission assets for the year ended december 31 2012 and 2011 approximately 29 and 22 respectively of the transportation revenues were derived from interruptible contracts 

environmental matters 

currently various environmental matters impact the gas transmission and storage operations segment as of december 31 2012 reserves have been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions refer to note 20d “environmental matters” in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the gas transmission and storage operations segment 

sissonville wv incident 

on december 11 2012 a buried 20inch diameter gas pipeline owned by columbia transmission ruptured in sissonville west virginia the incident resulted in no fatalities or life threatening injuries columbia transmission is fully cooperating with the national transportation safety board the us pipeline and hazardous materials safety administration the west virginia public service commission and other state and local authorities to thoroughly test inspect and verify the safety and operational integrity of the system columbia transmission believes any costs associated with damages injuries and other losses related to this incident are substantially covered by insurance any amounts not covered by insurance are not expected to have a material impact on nisources consolidated financial statements 

throughput 

columbia transmission provides transportation and storage services for ldcs and other customers across its system which covers portions of northeastern midatlantic midwestern and southern states and the district of columbia billed throughput for columbia transmission consists of deliveries off of its system excluding gas delivered to storage for later delivery billed throughput for columbia gulf reflects transportation services for gas delivered through its mainline and laterals crossroads pipeline’s throughput comes from deliveries it makes to its customers and other pipelines that are located in northern indiana and ohio intersegment eliminations represent gas delivered to affiliated pipelines within the segment 

throughput for the gas transmission and storage operations segment totaled 15951  mmdth for 2012 compared to 16357  mmdth for the same period in 2011 the decrease of 406 mmdth was primarily attributable to warmer winter weather in 2012 which drove a vast majority of the decrease on the columbia transmission system fewer deliveries were made on the columbia gulf system to columbia transmission at leach kentucky because of the impact from increased production of appalachian shale

gas and the warmer winter weather the increase in shale gas from the appalachian haynesville and barnett shale areas has also led to an increase in nontraditional throughput on columbia gulf in the form of deliveries to other interstate pipelines at liquid market centers on the columbia gulf system 

throughput for the gas transmission and storage operations segment totaled 16357  mmdth for 2011 compared to 13975  mmdth in 2010 the increase of 2382 mmdth was primarily due to increased transportation from the marcellus haynesville and barnett shale areas and increased deliveries to the power generation plants of the ldcs due to the more advantageous pricing of gas compared to coal additionally there were increased deliveries to local utilities to satisfy heating demand during a colder than normal winter early in 2011 

net revenues 

net revenues were 10004 million  for 2012 a decrease of 52 million from the same period in 2011 primarily due to the customer settlement at columbia transmission which decreased net revenues by 817 million additionally there was a decrease in condensate revenue of 43 million and a settlement of 28 million during the second quarter of 2011 and lower retainage revenues of 24 million primarily due to reversal of gas retained reserves in the fourth quarter of 2011 these decreases were partially offset by increased regulatory trackers which are offset in expense of 486 million higher demand margin revenue of 219 million primarily as a result of growth projects placed into service an increase of 83 million from the impact of higher rates at columbia gulf an increase of 61 million from shorter term transportation services and higher mineral rights royalty revenue of 41 million 

net revenues were 10056 million  for 2011 an increase of 564 million from the same period in 2010 primarily due to higher demand margin revenue of 323 million as a result of new growth projects additionally there was an increase of 148 million due to the net impact of the rate case filing at columbia gulf net revenues also increased due to increased midstream revenue of 106 million higher mineral rights royalty revenues of 84 million increased regulatory trackers of 59 million which are offset in expense and a onetime settlement of 28 million these increases in net revenues were partially offset by the impact of 83 million related to the recognition in 2010 of revenue for a previously deferred gain for native gas contributed to hardy storage from columbia transmission following hardy storage securing permanent financing additionally revenues decreased due to lower shorter term transportation and storage services of 67 million and the impact of 54 million of fees received from a contract buyout during the second quarter of 2010 

  

operating income 

operating income was  3984 million  for 2012 an increase of 384 million from the comparable period in 2011 operating income increased as a result of a decrease in operating expenses and an increase in equity earnings partially offset by lower net revenues as described above operating expenses decreased 260 million primarily due to a decrease in employee and administrative costs of 447 million driven primarily by decreased pension contributions lower depreciation and amortization of 307 million largely as a result of the columbia transmission customer settlement decreased environmental costs of 121 million primarily due to the 2011 environmental remediation liability adjustment and a decrease in software costs of 49 million these decreases were partially offset by increased regulatory trackers which are offset in revenue of 486 million increased outside services of 62 million primarily due to the timing of maintenance projects the writeoff of capital project costs of 43 million higher other taxes of 26 million primarily attributable to higher property taxes on increased plant investments higher costs associated with leases and rent of 21 million and increased retainage costs of 19 million equity earnings increased 176 million primarily from increased earnings at millennium due to higher demand and commodity revenues 

operating income was 3600 million  for 2011 a decrease of 166 million from the comparable period in 2010 operating income decreased as a result of higher operating expenses and lower equity earnings partially offset by higher net revenues as described above operating expenses increased 726 million primarily due to an increase in employee and administrative costs of 508 million driven largely by pension contributions higher environmental costs of 124 million and higher regulatory trackers of 59 million which are offset in net revenues additionally there was an increase of 49 million in software costs and 41 million in separation costs these increases were partially offset by a decrease of 80 million in outside service costs equity earnings decreased 04 million compared to 2010 as a result of lower earnings at millennium

during the year ended december 31 2011 northern indiana generated 838 and purchased 162 of its electric requirements northern indiana’s mitchell station indefinitely shut down in 2002 is not included in the net capacity of the three coalfired generation stations 

northern indiana participates in the miso transmission service and wholesale energy market the miso is a nonprofit organization created in compliance with ferc regulations to improve the flow of electricity in the regional marketplace and to enhance electric reliability additionally the miso is responsible for managing the energy markets managing transmission constraints managing the dayahead realtime and ftr markets and managing the ancillary market northern indiana transferred functional control of its electric transmission assets to the miso and transmission service for northern indiana occurs under the miso open access transmission tariff 

corporate and other operations 

during the first quarter of 2010 nisource made the decision to wind down its unregulated natural gas marketing activities as a part of the company’s longterm strategy of focusing on its core regulated business 

divestiture of noncore assets 

in recent years nisource sold certain businesses judged to be noncore to nisource’s strategy lake erie land a whollyowned subsidiary of nisource is pursuing the sale of certain real estate assets it owns ndc douglas properties a subsidiary of nisource development company is in the process of exiting its low income housing investments 

business strategy 

nisource focuses its business strategy on its core rateregulated assetbased businesses with most of its operating income generated from the rateregulated businesses with one of the nation’s largest natural gas pipelines one of the largest natural gas distribution networks east of the rocky mountains and one of the nation’s largest natural gas storage networks nisource operates throughout the energyintensive corridor that extends from the supply areas in the gulf coast through the consumption centers in the midwest midatlantic new england and northeast this corridor includes over 40 of the nation’s population and close to 50 of its natural gas consumption nisource continues to position its assets to meet the corridor’s growing energy needs 

competition and changes in the regulatory environment 

the regulatory frameworks applicable to nisource’s operations at both the state and federal levels continue to evolve these changes have had and will continue to have an impact on nisource’s operations structure and profitability management continually seeks new ways to be more competitive and profitable in this changing environment including providing gas customers with increased choices for products and services 

natural gas competition  open access to natural gas supplies over interstate pipelines and the deregulation of the commodity price of gas has led to tremendous change in the energy markets ldc customers and marketers purchase gas directly from producers and marketers as an open competitive market for gas supplies has emerged this separation or “unbundling” of the transportation and other services offered by pipelines and ldcs allows customers to purchase the commodity independent of services provided by the pipelines and ldcs the ldcs continue to purchase gas and recover the associated costs from their customers nisource’s gas distribution operations’ subsidiaries are involved in programs that provide customers the opportunity to purchase their natural gas requirements from third parties and use the nisource gas distribution operations’ subsidiaries for transportation services the gas transmission and storage operations compete for transportation customers based on the type of service a customer needs operating flexibility available capacity and price under tariff provisions 

electric competition  northern indiana currently dispatches all power from its plants into the miso transmission service for northern indiana occurs under the miso open access transmission tariff

 item 1a risk factors 

n i s ource i nc  

there are many factors that could have a material adverse effect on nisource’s operating results financial condition and cash flows new risks may emerge at any time and nisource cannot predict those risks or estimate the extent to which they may affect financial performance each of the risks described below could adversely impact the value of nisource’s securities 

nisource has substantial indebtedness which could adversely affect its financial condition 

nisource had total consolidated indebtedness of 79538 million outstanding as of december 31 2011 the substantial indebtedness could have important consequences to investors for example it could 

 

       some of nisource’s debt obligations contain financial covenants related to debttocapital ratios and crossdefault provisions nisource’s failure to comply with any of these covenants could result in an event of default which if not cured or waived could result in the acceleration of outstanding debt obligations additionally a drop in nisource’s credit rating could adversely impact the cost for nisource to issue new debt securities 

a drop in nisource’s credit rating could adversely impact nisource’s liquidity 

on december 13 2011 fitch affirmed the senior unsecured ratings for nisource at bbb and the existing ratings of all other subsidiaries fitch’s outlook for nisource and all of its subsidiaries is stable on november 18 2011 moody’s investors service affirmed the senior unsecured ratings for nisource at baa3 and the existing ratings of all other subsidiaries moody’s outlook for nisource and all of its subsidiaries is stable on february 24 2011 standard  poor’s affirmed the senior unsecured ratings for nisource and its subsidiaries at bbb standard  poor’s outlook for nisource and all of its subsidiaries is stable although all ratings continue to be investment grade a downgrade by standard  poor’s moody’s or fitch would result in a rating that is below investment grade 

certain nisource affiliates have agreements that contain “ratings triggers” that require increased collateral if the credit ratings of nisource or certain of its subsidiaries are rated below bbb by standard  poor’s or baa3 by moody’s these agreements are primarily for insurance purposes and for the physical purchase or sale of power the collateral requirement from a downgrade below the ratings trigger levels would amount to approximately 210 million in addition to agreements with ratings triggers there are other agreements that contain “adequate assurance” or “material adverse change” provisions that could necessitate additional credit support such as letters of credit and cash collateral to transact business under northern indiana’s trade receivables sales program an event of termination occurs if northern indiana’s debt rating is withdrawn by either standard  poor’s or moody’s or falls below bb or ba2 at either standard  poor’s or moody’s respectively likewise under columbia of ohio’s and columbia of pennsylvania’s trade receivables sales programs an event of termination occurs if nisource’s debt rating is withdrawn by either standard  poor’s or moody’s or falls below bb or ba3 at either standard  poor’s or moody’s respectively 

additionally as a result of nisource’s participation in certain derivative activities a credit downgrade could cause nisource to be required to post substantial collateral in support of past and current transactions these collateral requirements combined with other potential negative effects on nisource’s liquidity in the event of a credit downgrade below an investment grade rating could have a material adverse effect on earnings potential and cash flows lastly a credit downgrade could adversely affect the availability and cost of capital needed to fund the growth investments which are a central element of the company’s longterm business strategy

nisource may not be able to execute its growth strategy as planned 

because of changes in the business or regulatory environment nisource may not be able to execute its fourpart business plan as intended nisource’s commercial and regulatory initiatives may not achieve planned results levels of commercial growth and expansion of the gas transmission and storage business may be less than its plan has anticipated and the actual results of nisource’s financial management of the balance sheet and process and expense management could deviate materially from planned outcomes 

adverse economic and market conditions or increases in interest rates could reduce net revenue growth increase costs decrease future net income and cash flows and impact capital resources and liquidity needs 

while the national economy is experiencing some recovery from the recent downturn nisource cannot predict how robust the recovery will be or whether or not it will be sustained 

continued sluggishness in the economy impacting nisource’s operating jurisdictions could adversely impact nisource’s ability to grow its customer base and collect revenues from customers which could reduce net revenue growth and increase operating costs an increase in the interest rates nisource pays would adversely affect future net income and cash flows in addition nisource depends on debt to finance its operations including both working capital and capital expenditures and would be adversely affected by increases in interest rates if the current economic recovery remains slow or credit markets again tighten nisource’s ability to raise additional capital or refinance debt at a reasonable cost could be negatively impacted refer to note 16 “longterm debt” in the notes to consolidated financial statements for information related to outstanding longterm debt and maturities of that debt 

capital market performance and other factors may decrease the value of benefit plan assets which then could require significant additional funding and impact earnings 

the performance of the capital markets affects the value of the assets that are held in trust to satisfy future obligations under defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans nisource has significant obligations in these areas and holds significant assets in these trusts these assets are subject to market fluctuations and may yield uncertain returns which fall below nisource’s projected rates of return a decline in the market value of assets may increase the funding requirements of the obligations under the defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans additionally changes in interest rates affect the liabilities under these benefit plans as interest rates decrease the liabilities increase which could potentially increase funding requirements further the funding requirements of the obligations related to these benefits plans may increase due to changes in governmental regulations and participant demographics including increased numbers of retirements or changes in life expectancy assumptions ultimately significant funding requirements and increased pension expense could negatively impact nisource’s results of operations and financial position 

the majority of nisource’s net revenues is subject to economic regulation and is exposed to the impact of regulatory rate reviews and proceedings 

most of nisource’s net revenues are subject to economic regulation at either the federal or state level as such the net revenues generated by those regulated companies are subject to regulatory review by the applicable federal or state authority these rate reviews determine the energy rates charged to customers and directly impact revenues nisource’s financial results are dependent on frequent regulatory proceedings in order to ensure timely recovery of costs additionally the costs of complying with future changes in environmental laws and regulations are expected to be significant and their recovery through rates will be contingent on regulatory approval 

as a result of efforts to introduce marketbased competition in certain of the markets where the regulated businesses conduct operations nisource may compete with independent marketers for customers this competition exposes nisource to the risk that certain stranded costs may not be recoverable and may affect results of nisource’s growth strategy and cash flows 

  

item 1a risk factors 

n i s ource i nc  

  

nisource’s costs of compliance with environmental laws are significant the costs of compliance with future environmental laws and the recognition of environmental liabilities could impact cash flow and profitability 

nisource’s subsidiaries are subject to extensive federal state and local environmental requirements that among other things regulate air emissions water usage and discharges remediation and the management of chemicals hazardous waste solid waste and coal combustion residuals compliance with these legal obligations requires nisource to make expenditures for installation of pollution control equipment remediation environmental monitoring emissions fees and permits at many of nisource’s facilities these expenditures are significant and nisource expects that they will continue to be significant in the future furthermore if nisource’s subsidiaries fail to comply with environmental laws and regulations or cause harm to the environment or persons even if caused by factors beyond nisource’s control that failure or harm may result in the assessment of civil or criminal penalties and damages against nisource and its subsidiaries 

existing environmental laws and regulations may be revised and new laws and regulations seeking to protect the environment may be adopted or become applicable to nisource’s subsidiaries revised or additional laws and regulations could result in significant additional expense and operating restrictions on nisource’s facilities or increased compliance costs which may not be fully recoverable from customers and would therefore reduce net income moreover such costs could materially affect the continued economic viability of one or more of nisource’s facilities 

because nisource’s operations deal with natural gas and coal fossil fuels emissions of ghgs are an expected aspect of the business while nisource attempts to reduce ghg emissions through efficiency programs leak detection and other programs ghg emissions cannot be entirely eliminated the current administration has made it clear that it is focused on reducing ghg emissions through legislation andor regulation imposing statutory or regulatory restrictions andor costs on ghg emissions could increase nisource’s cost of producing energy which could impact customer demand or nisource’s profitability compliance costs associated with these requirements could also affect nisource’s cash flow the cost impact of any new or amended ghg legislation or regulations would depend upon the specific requirements enacted and cannot be determined at this time 

even in instances where legal and regulatory requirements are already known the original estimates for cleanup and environmental capital projects can differ materially from the amount ultimately expended the actual future expenditures depend on many factors including the nature and extent of contamination the method of cleanup the cost of raw materials contractor costs and the availability of cost recovery from customers changes in costs could affect nisource’s financial position and cash flows 

a significant portion of the gas and electricity nisource sells is used by residential and commercial customers for heating and air conditioning accordingly the operating results fluctuate depending on the weather and to a certain extent usage of gas or electricity 

energy sales are sensitive to variations in weather forecasts of energy sales are based on normal weather which represents a longterm historical average significant variations from normal weather could have and have had a material impact on energy sales additionally residential usage and to some degree commercial usage have shown to be sensitive to fluctuations in commodity costs for gas and electricity whereby usage declines with increased costs thus affecting nisource’s financial results lastly residential and commercial customers’ usage has shown to be sensitive to economic conditions and the impact of macroeconomic drivers such as unemployment consumption and consumer confidence which could also affect nisource’s financial results 

nisource’s business operations are subject to economic conditions in certain industries 

business operations throughout nisource’s service territories have been and may continue to be adversely affected by economic events at the national and local level where it operates in particular sales to large industrial customers may be impacted by economic downturns the us manufacturing industry continues to adjust to changing market conditions including international competition increasing costs and fluctuating demand for its products

n i s ource i nc  

  

fluctuations in the price of energy commodities or their related transportation costs may have a negative impact on nisource’s financial results 

nisource’s electric generating fleet is dependent on coal and natural gas for fuel and its gas distribution operations purchase and resell much of the natural gas they deliver these energy commodities are vulnerable to price fluctuations and fluctuations in associated transportation costs hedging activities have been deployed in order to offset fluctuations in commodity supply prices and nisource relies on regulatory recovery mechanisms in the various jurisdictions in order to fully recover the costs incurred in operations however while nisource has historically been successful in recovery of costs related to such commodity prices there can be no assurance that such costs will be fully recovered through rates in a timely manner additionally increased gas and electricity costs could result in reduced demand from customers as a result of increased conservation activities 

nisource is exposed to risk that customers will not remit payment for delivered energy or services and that suppliers or counterparties will not perform under various financial or operating agreements 

nisource’s extension of credit is governed by a corporate credit risk policy involves considerable judgment and is based on an evaluation of a customer or counterparty’s financial condition credit history and other factors credit risk exposure is monitored by obtaining credit reports and updated financial information for customers and suppliers and by evaluating the financial status of its banking partners and other counterparties through the use of marketbased metrics such as credit default swap pricing levels and also through traditional credit ratings provided by the major credit rating agencies continued adverse economic conditions could increase credit risk and could result in a material adverse effect on nisource 

nisource has significant goodwill and definitelived intangible assets an impairment of goodwill or definitelived intangible assets could result in a significant charge to earnings 

in accordance with gaap nisource tests goodwill for impairment at least annually and reviews its definitelived intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable goodwill would also be tested for impairment when factors examples of which include reduced cash flow estimates a sustained decline in stock price or market capitalization below book value indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable nisource would be required to record a charge in the financial statements during the period in which any impairment of the goodwill or definitelived intangible assets is determined negatively impacting the results of operations a significant charge could impact the capitalization ratio covenant under certain financing agreements a covenant in the fouryear revolving credit facility requires nisource to maintain a debt to capitalization ratio that does not exceed 70 a similar covenant in a 2005 private placement note purchase agreement requires nisource to maintain a debt to capitalization ratio that does not exceed 75 as of december 31 2011 the ratio was 614 

changes in taxation and the ability to quantify such changes could adversely affect nisource’s financial results 

nisource is subject to taxation by the various taxing authorities at the federal state and local levels where it does business legislation or regulation which could affect nisource’s tax burden could be enacted by any of these governmental authorities nisource cannot predict the timing or extent of such taxrelated developments which could have a negative impact on the financial results additionally nisource uses its best judgment in attempting to quantify and reserve for these tax obligations however a challenge by a taxing authority nisource’s ability to utilize tax benefits such as carryforwards or tax credits or a deviation from other taxrelated assumptions may cause actual financial results to deviate from previous estimates 

changes in accounting principles may adversely affect nisource’s financial results 

future changes in accounting rules such as ifrs and associated changes in regulatory accounting may negatively impact the way nisource records revenues expenses assets and liabilities these changes in accounting standards may adversely affect its financial results 

  

item 1a risk factors 

n i s ource i nc  

  

transporting and storing natural gas involves numerous risks that may result in accidents and other operating risks and costs 

nisource’s gas distribution and gas transmission and storage activities involve a variety of inherent hazards and operating risks such as leaks accidents including third party damages and mechanical problems which could cause substantial financial losses in addition these risks could result in serious injury to employees and nonemployees loss of human life significant damage to property environmental pollution and impairment of its operations which in turn could lead to substantial losses to nisource in accordance with customary industry practice nisource maintains insurance against some but not all of these risks and losses the location of pipelines and storage facilities near populated areas including residential areas commercial business centers and industrial sites could increase the level of damages resulting from these risks the occurrence of any of these events not fully covered by insurance could adversely affect nisource’s financial position and results of operations 

aging infrastructure may lead to increased costs and disruptions in operations that could negatively impact nisource’s financial results 

nisource has risks associated with aging infrastructure assets the age of these assets may result in replacement a higher level of maintenance costs and may be susceptible to unscheduled outages despite diligent efforts by nisource to properly maintain these assets through inspection scheduled maintenance and capital investment the failure to operate these assets as desired could result in nisource’s inability to meet firm service obligations adversely impact revenues and could result in increased capital expenditures and expenses which may not be fully recoverable from customers 

climate change natural disasters acts of terrorism cyberattacks or other catastrophic events may disrupt operations and reduce the ability to service customers 

a disruption or failure of natural gas transmission storage or distribution systems or within electric generation transmission or distribution systems in the event of a major hurricane tornado terrorist attack or other catastrophic event could cause delays in completing sales providing services or performing other critical functions nisource has experienced disruptions in the past from hurricanes and tornadoes and other events of this nature the cost availability and sufficiency of insurance for these risks could adversely affect nisource’s results of operations financial position and cash flows 

there is also a concern that climate change may exacerbate the risks to physical infrastructure associated with heat and extreme weather conditions climate change and the costs that may be associated with its impacts have the potential to affect nisource’s business in many ways including increasing the cost nisource incurs in providing its products and services impacting the demand for and consumption of its products and services due to change in both costs and weather patterns and affecting the economic health of the regions in which nisource operates 

additionally a security breach of nisource’s information systems could i impact the reliability of nisource’s generation transmission storage and distribution systems and potentially negatively impact nisource’s compliance with certain mandatory reliability standards ii subject nisource to harm associated with theft or inappropriate release of certain types of information such as system operating information or information personal or otherwise relating to nisource’s customers or employees or iii impact nisource’s ability to manage nisource’s businesses 

growing nisource’s business by constructing new pipelines and other facilities subjects nisource to construction risks and natural gas supply risks 

nisource gas transmission  storage operations continues to complete and advance customerdriven growth projects across its system primarily surrounding the marcellus and utica shale production area in the states of pennsylvania ohio and west virginia these growth projects may include constructing or purchasing pipelines and treatment and processing facilities which subjects nisource to construction risks and risks that gas supplies will not be available if nisource undertakes these projects it may not be able to complete them on schedule or at the anticipated costs nisource may construct or purchase these projects to capture anticipated future growth in production in the region which may not materialize and the construction may occur over an extended period of time and nisource will not receive material increases in revenue and cash flows until after the completion of the project nisource competes for these projects with companies of varying size and financial capabilities including some that may have advantages competing for natural gas and liquid gas supplies as well as acquisitions and other business opportunities

sustained extreme weather conditions may negatively impact nisource’s operations 

nisource conducts its operations across a wide geographic area subject to varied and potentially extreme weather conditions which may from time to time persist for sustained periods of time despite preventative maintenance efforts persistent weather related stress on nisource’s infrastructure may reveal weaknesses in its systems not previously known to the company or otherwise present various operational challenges across all business segments although nisource makes every effort to plan for weather related contingencies adverse weather may affect its ability to conduct operations in a manner that satisfies customer expectations or contractual obligations the company endeavors to minimize such service disruptions but may not be able to avoid them altogether 

growing competition in the gas transportation industry could result in the failure by customers to renew existing contracts 

as a consequence of the increase in competition in the industry and the shift in natural gas production areas end users and ldcs may be reluctant to enter into longterm service contracts the renewal or replacement of existing contracts with nisource’s customers at rates sufficient to maintain current or projected revenues and cash flows depends on a number of factors beyond its control including competition from other pipelines gatherers the proximity of supplies to the markets and the price of and demand for natural gas the inability of nisource to renew or replace its current contracts as they expire and respond appropriately to changing market conditions could materially impact its financial results 

nisource is a holding company and is dependent on cash generated by subsidiaries to meet its debt obligations and pay dividends on its common stock 

nisource is a holding company and conducts its operations primarily through its subsidiaries substantially all of nisource’s consolidated assets are held by its subsidiaries accordingly nisource’s ability to meet its debt obligations or pay dividends on its common stock is largely dependent upon cash generated by these subsidiaries in the event a major subsidiary is not be able to pay dividends or transfer cash flows to nisource its ability to service its debt obligations or pay dividends could be negatively affected

ethics and controls 

nisource has had a long term commitment to providing accurate and complete financial reporting as well as high standards for ethical behavior by its employees nisource’s senior management takes an active role in the development of this form 10k and the monitoring of the company’s internal control structure and performance in addition nisource will continue its mandatory ethics training program in which employees at every level throughout the organization participate 

refer to “management’s report on internal control over financial reporting” included in item 9a 

results of operations 

the following information should be read taking into account the critical accounting policies applied by nisource as discussed in “other information” of this item 7 

income from continuing operations and net income 

for the twelve months ended december 31 2011 nisource reported income from continuing operations of 3038 million or 108 per basic share compared to 2852 million or 103 per basic share in 2010 income from continuing operations for the twelve months ended december 31 2009 was 2298 million or 084 per basic share 

including results from discontinued operations nisource reported 2011 net income of 2991 million or 106 per basic share 2010 net income of 2826 million or 102 per basic share and 2009 net income of 2170 million or 079 per basic share 

comparability of line item operating results was impacted by regulatory and tax trackers that allow for the recovery in rates of certain costs such as bad debt expenses therefore increases in these tracked operating expenses were offset by increases in net revenues and had essentially no impact on income from continuing operations a decrease in operating expenses of 404 million for the 2011 year was offset by a corresponding decrease to net revenues reflecting these tracked costs in the 2010 period a decrease in operating expenses of 76 million for trackers was offset by a corresponding decrease to net revenues reflecting recovery of these costs these changes from 2010 to 2011 were largely attributable to fluctuations in recoveries associated with low income assistance programs 

immaterial restatement 

as discussed further below nisource is making certain correcting adjustments to its historical financial statements for the quarters of 2011 and 2010 and for the years of 2010 and 2009 as well as to other selected financial data for the years 2008 and 2007 nisource does not believe these corrections are material individually or in the aggregate to its financial condition or its financial results for any reported period refer to the tables below for the effects of these corrections on prior periods 

deferred revenue in the fourth quarter of 2011 nisource identified a deferred revenue regulatory asset of 252 million that was not recoverable the impact of the correction in 2010 and 2009 resulted in a decrease in electric revenue of 74 million and an increase of 10 million respectively with an offset to deferred revenue regulatory assets the remaining decrease in electric revenue of 182 million was corrected prior to 2009 the correction reduced electric revenue by a total of 06 million for previously reported interim periods in 2011 there was no impact to customers as a result of this correction 

environmental asset recovery nisource recorded an out of period charge of 34 million in operation and maintenance expense and 46 million in depreciation and amortization expense in the first quarter of 2011 to impair a regulatory environmental asset that was not recoverable which impairment charge should have been recorded in a prior year the impact of the correction in 2010 and 2009 resulted in an increase to expense of 14 million and 10 million respectively with an offset to regulatory assets the remaining increase to expense of 56 million was corrected prior to 2009 

opeb overreimbursement in the fourth quarter of 2011 nisource identified an overreimbursement of 80 million received by nisource from an insurer related to other postemployment benefits the impact of the correction in 2010 and 2009 resulted in an increase in operation and maintenance expense of 10 million and 11 million respectively with an offset to other accruals the remaining increase in expense of 54 million was corrected prior to 2009 the correction increased expense by a total of 05 million for previously reported interim periods in 2011

 net revenues 

nisource analyzes the operating results using net revenues net revenues are calculated as revenues less the associated cost of sales excluding depreciation and amortization nisource believes net revenues is a better measure to analyze profitability than gross operating revenues since the majority of the cost of sales are tracked costs that are passed through directly to the customer resulting in an equal and offsetting amount reflected in gross operating revenues 

total consolidated net revenues for the twelve months ended december 31 2011 were 34627 million a 222 million increase compared with 2010 net revenues increased primarily due to increased gas transmission and storage operations’ operating revenues of 564 million and increased electric operations’ net revenues of 76 million partially offset by lower gas distribution operations’ net revenues of 213 million 

 

   

item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

n i s ource i nc  

  

  

 total consolidated net revenues for the twelve months ended december 31 2010 were 34405 million a 1069 million increase compared with 2009 net revenues increased primarily due to increased electric operations’ net revenues of 1131 million and increased gas transmission and storage operations’ operating revenues of 185 million partially offset by lower gas distribution operations’ net revenues of 69 million 

 

  

  

 expenses 

operating expenses were 25722 million in 2011 an increase of 224 million from the comparable 2010 period this increase was primarily due to an increase in operation and maintenance expenses of 592 million higher impairment charges of 148 million and increased other taxes of 73 million the increase in operation and maintenance is due primarily to an increase in employee and administrative costs driven largely by an increase in pension contributions at gas transmission and storage operations as provided by its rate cases gaap pension

expense is deferred to a regulatory asset and pension contributions are recorded to expense additionally during the fourth quarter of 2011 nisource reviewed its current estimates for future environmental remediation costs related to the company’s mgp sites following the review nisource revised its estimates based on expected remediation activities and experience with similar facilities and recorded 355 million of expense at subsidiaries for which environmental expense is not probable of recovery from customers higher impairment costs relate to the additional impairment of 147 million recorded in the fourth quarter of 2011 related to lake erie land these increases were partially offset by a decrease of 589 million in depreciation and amortization expense primarily as a result of the new depreciation rates at northern indiana as a result of the implementation of the gas rate case 

operating expenses were 25498 million in 2010 an increase of 02 million from the comparable 2009 period this increase was primarily due to an increase of 360 million in payroll and benefits expense an increase of 200 million in maintenance costs including integrity management pipeline costs and an increase of 72 million in depreciation costs due to the increased capital expenditures these increases were partially offset by decreased restructuring charges of 272 million lower impairment charges of 213 million and lower uncollectible costs of 128 million 

equity earnings in unconsolidated affiliates 

equity earnings in unconsolidated affiliates were 146 million in 2011 a decrease of 04 million compared with 2010 equity earnings in unconsolidated affiliates includes investments in millennium and hardy storage which are integral to the gas transmission and storage operations business equity earnings decreased primarily resulting from lower earnings from columbia transmission’s investment in millennium 

equity earnings in unconsolidated affiliates were 150 million in 2010 compared to 160 million in 2009 equity earnings decreased primarily resulting from lower earnings from columbia transmission’s investment in millennium driven by higher interest costs and hedge loss amortization related to millennium’s august 2010 debt refinancing 

other income deductions 

other income deductions in 2011 reduced income 4380 million compared to a reduction of 4852 million in 2010 the increase in other income is due to a decrease in the loss on early extinguishment of debt of 428 million in the current year as a result of less redemptions of high interest debt in the fourth quarter of 2011 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2010 also there was a decrease in interest expense of 155 million interest expense decreased due to the repurchase of a portion of the 2016 and 2013 notes in november 2011 and a portion of the 2016 notes in december 2010 and a longterm debt maturity of 6818 million in november 2010 the benefits were partially offset by incremental interest expense associated with a swap maturity in november 2010 the issuance of 5000 million of longterm debt in november 2011 4000 million in june 2011 and 2500 million in december 2010 and higher average shortterm borrowings and rates these decreases were partially offset by an increase of 111 million in other net due primarily to an increase in charitable contributions in the current year 

other income deductions in 2010 reduced income 4852 million compared to a reduction of 4052 million in 2009 the decrease in other income was primarily due to a 967 million loss on the early extinguishment of longterm debt partially offset by a decrease in interest expense of 70 million interest expense decreased primarily due to the 6818 million november 2010 longterm debt maturity the 3850 million december 2009 term loan repayment the maturity of the company’s 4176 million november 2009 floating rate note and lower shortterm interest rates the interest expense benefits were partially offset by incremental interest expense associated with the issuance of 2500 million of longterm debt in december 2010 the issuance of the 5000 million december 2009 longterm debt and the effect of the adoption of new accounting requirements related to the company’s accounts receivable facilities additionally other net increased from an expense of 14 million in 2009 to income of 38 million in 2010 related to the classification of interest expense as a result of the adoption of the new accounting requirements noted above 

income taxes 

the effective income tax rates were 350 322 and 418 in 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively the 28 increase in the overall effective tax rate in 2011 versus 2010 was primarily due to a tax rate change in indiana in 2011 that resulted in recording 68 million in tax expense in the second quarter and the 2010 rate settlements that resulted in the flow through of certain tax benefits in rates the effect of the rate settlements also was the primary

commodity price risk 

nisource is exposed to commodity price risk as a result of its subsidiaries’ operations involving natural gas and power to manage this market risk nisource’s subsidiaries use derivatives including commodity futures contracts swaps and options nisource is not involved in speculative energy trading activity 

commodity price risk resulting from derivative activities at nisource’s rateregulated subsidiaries is limited since regulations allow recovery of prudently incurred purchased power fuel and gas costs through the ratemaking process including gains or losses on these derivative instruments if states should explore additional regulatory reform these subsidiaries may begin providing services without the benefit of the traditional ratemaking process and may be more exposed to commodity price risk some of nisource’s rateregulated utility subsidiaries offer commodity price risk products to their customers for which derivatives are used to hedge forecasted customer usage under such products these subsidiaries do not have regulatory recovery orders for these products and are subject to gains and losses recognized in earnings due to hedge ineffectiveness 

all derivatives classified as hedges are assessed for hedge effectiveness with any components determined to be ineffective charged to earnings or classified as regulatory assets or liabilities as appropriate during 2011 and 2010 no income was recognized in earnings due to the ineffectiveness of derivative instruments being accounted for as hedges during 2009 nisource reclassified 1264 million 751 million net of tax related to its cash flow hedges from accumulated other comprehensive income loss to earnings due to the probability that certain forecasted transactions would not occur related to the unregulated natural gas marketing business that nisource had planned to sell nisource has not made any material reclassifications in 2011 or 2010 during the fourth quarter of 2011 nisource recorded a reserve of 226 million on certain assets related to the winddown of the unregulated natural gas marketing business it is anticipated that during the next twelve months the expiration and settlement of cash flow hedge contracts will result in income statement recognition of amounts currently classified in accumulated other comprehensive income loss of approximately 07 million of loss net of taxes refer to note 9 “risk management and energy marketing activities” in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information on nisource’s various derivative programs for managing commodity price risk 

nisource subsidiaries are required to make cash margin deposits with their brokers to cover actual and potential losses in the value of outstanding exchange traded derivative contracts the amount of these deposits which are reflected in nisource’s restricted cash balance may fluctuate significantly during periods of high volatility in the energy commodity markets 

interest rate risk 

nisource is exposed to interest rate risk as a result of changes in interest rates on borrowings under its revolving credit agreement commercial paper program and accounts receivable programs which have interest rates that are indexed to shortterm market interest rates nisource is also exposed to interest rate risk due to changes in interest rates on fixedtovariable interest rate swaps that hedge the fair value of longterm debt based upon average borrowings and debt obligations subject to fluctuations in shortterm market interest rates an increase or decrease in shortterm interest rates of 100 basis points 1 would have increased or decreased interest expense by 165 million and 147 million for the years 2011 and 2010 respectively 

contemporaneously with the pricing of the 525 notes and 545 notes issued september 16 2005 nisource finance settled 900 million of forward starting interest rate swap agreements with six counterparties nisource paid an aggregate settlement payment of 355 million which is being amortized as an increase to interest expense over the term of the underlying debt resulting in an effective interest rate of 567 and 588 respectively 

nisource has entered into interest rate swap agreements to modify the interest rate characteristics of a portion of its outstanding longterm debt from fixed to variable on may 12 2004 nisource finance entered into fixedtovariable interest rate swap agreements in a notional amount of 660 million with six counterparties having a 6 12year term nisource finance received payments based upon a fixed 7875 interest rate and paid a floating interest amount based on us 6month bba libor plus an average of 308 per annum on september 15 2008 as a result of the lehman brothers holdings inc bankruptcy filing the previous day nisource finance terminated a fixedtovariable interest rate swap agreement with lehman brothers having a notional amount of 1100 million on november 15 2010 the term of the remaining 5500 million of interest rate swaps expired and the swaps were terminated

on july 22 2003 nisource finance entered into fixedtovariable interest rate swap agreements in a notional amount of 500 million with four counterparties with an 11year term nisource finance receives payments based upon a fixed 540 interest rate and pays a floating interest amount based on us 6month bba libor plus an average of 078 per annum there was no exchange of premium at the initial date of the swaps in addition each party has the right to cancel the swaps on july 15 2013 

as of december 31 2011 5000 million of nisource finance’s existing longterm debt is subject to fluctuations in interest rates as a result of these fixedtovariable interest rate swap transactions 

credit risk 

due to the nature of the industry credit risk is embedded in many of nisource’s business activities nisource’s extension of credit is governed by a corporate credit risk policy in addition risk management committee guidelines are in place which document management approval levels for credit limits evaluation of creditworthiness and credit risk mitigation efforts exposures to credit risks are monitored by the corporate credit risk function which is independent of commercial operations credit risk arises due to the possibility that a customer supplier or counterparty will not be able or willing to fulfill its obligations on a transaction on or before the settlement date for forward commodity contracts credit risk arises when counterparties are obligated to deliver or purchase defined commodity units of gas or power to nisource at a future date per execution of contractual terms and conditions exposure to credit risk is measured in terms of both current obligations and the market value of forward positions net of any posted collateral such as cash letters of credit and qualified guarantees of support 

nisource closely monitors the financial status of its banking credit providers and interest rate swap counterparties nisource evaluates the financial status of its banking partners through the use of marketbased metrics such as credit default swap pricing levels and also through traditional credit ratings provided by the major credit rating agencies 

on october 31 2011 cash and derivatives brokerdealer mf global filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection mf global brokered nymex hedges of natural gas futures on behalf of nisource affiliates at the date of bankruptcy nisource affiliates had contracts open with mf global with settlement dates ranging from november 2011 to february 2014 on november 3 2011 these contracts were measured at a marktomarket loss of approximately 464 million nisource affiliates had posted initial margin to open these accounts of 69 million and additional maintenance margin for marktomarket losses for a total cash balance of 533 million within the first week after the filing at the direction of the bankruptcy court a transfer of assets was initiated on behalf of nisource affiliates to a courtdesignated replacement broker for future trade activity the existing futures positions were closed and then rebooked with the replacement broker at the new closing prices as of november 3 2011 initial margin on deposit at mf global of 57 million was transferred to the courtdesignated replacement broker the maintenance margin was retained by mf global to offset the loss positions of the open contracts on november 3 2011 nisource affiliates are monitoring the activity in the bankruptcy case and have filed a proof of claim at the court’s direction as of december 31 2011 nisource affiliates reserved the 12 million difference between the initial margin posted with mf global and the cash transferred to the courtdesignated replacement broker as a loss contingency 

fair value measurement 

nisource measures certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value the level of the fair value hierarchy disclosed is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement nisource’s financial assets and liabilities include price risk assets and liabilities availableforsale securities and a deferred compensation plan obligation 

exchangetraded derivative contracts are generally based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets and are classified within level 1 these financial assets and liabilities are secured with cash on deposit with the exchange therefore nonperformance risk has not been incorporated into these valuations certain nonexchangetraded derivatives are valued using broker or overthecounter online exchanges in such cases these nonexchangetraded derivatives are classified within level 2 nonexchangebased derivative instruments include swaps forwards and options in certain instances these instruments may utilize models to measure fair value nisource uses a similar model to value similar instruments valuation models utilize various inputs that include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets

that are not active other observable inputs for the asset or liability and marketcorroborated inputs ie inputs derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means where observable inputs are available for substantially the full term of the asset or liability the instrument is categorized in level 2 certain derivatives trade in less active markets with a lower availability of pricing information and models may be utilized in the valuation when such inputs have a significant impact on the measurement of fair value the instrument is categorized in level 3 credit risk is considered in the fair value calculation of derivative instruments that are not exchangetraded credit exposures are adjusted to reflect collateral agreements which reduce exposures 

price risk management assets also include fixedtofloating interestrate swaps which are designated as fair value hedges as a means to achieve its targeted level of variablerate debt as a percent of total debt nisource uses a calculation of future cash inflows and estimated future outflows related to the swap agreements which are discounted and netted to determine the current fair value additional inputs to the present value calculation include the contract terms as well as market parameters such as current and projected interest rates and volatility as they are based on observable data and valuations of similar instruments the interestrate swaps are categorized in level 2 in the fair value hierarchy credit risk is considered in the fair value calculation of the interest rate swap 

refer to note 18 “fair value disclosures” in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on nisource’s fair value measurements 

market risk measurement 

market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices rates indices volatilities correlations or other market factors such as liquidity will result in losses for a specified position or portfolio nisource calculates a oneday var at a 95 confidence level for the gas marketing group that utilizes a variancecovariance methodology the daily market exposure for the gas marketing portfolio on an average high and low basis was 01 million 01 million and zero during 2011 respectively prospectively management has set the var limit at 08 million for gas marketing exceeding this limit would result in management actions to reduce portfolio risk

other information 

critical accounting policies 

nisource applies certain accounting policies based on the accounting requirements discussed below that have had and may continue to have significant impacts on nisource’s results of operations and consolidated balance sheets 

basis of accounting for rateregulated subsidiaries asc topic 980 regulated operations  provides that rateregulated subsidiaries account for and report assets and liabilities consistent with the economic effect of the way in which regulators establish rates if the rates established are designed to recover the costs of providing the regulated service and if the competitive environment makes it probable that such rates can be charged and collected certain expenses and credits subject to utility regulation or rate determination normally reflected in income are deferred on the consolidated balance sheets and are recognized in income as the related amounts are included in service rates and recovered from or refunded to customers the total amounts of regulatory assets and liabilities reflected on the consolidated balance sheets were 21479 million and 17759 million at december 31 2011 and 17918 million and 16887 million at december 31 2010 respectively for additional information refer to note 8 “regulatory matters” in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

in the event that regulation significantly changes the opportunity for nisource to recover its costs in the future all or a portion of nisource’s regulated operations may no longer meet the criteria for the application of asc topic 980 regulated operations  in such event a writedown of all or a portion of nisource’s existing regulatory assets and liabilities could result if transition cost recovery is approved by the appropriate regulatory bodies that would meet the requirements under generally accepted accounting principles for continued accounting as regulatory assets and liabilities during such recovery period the regulatory assets and liabilities would be reported at the recoverable amounts if unable to continue to apply the provisions of asc topic 980 regulated operations  nisource would 

  

item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

n i s ource i nc  

  

be required to apply the provisions of asc topic 98020 discontinuation of rateregulated accounting  in management’s opinion nisource’s regulated subsidiaries will be subject to asc topic 980 regulated operations for the foreseeable future 

certain of the regulatory assets reflected on nisource’s consolidated balance sheets require specific regulatory action in order to be included in future service rates although recovery of these amounts is not guaranteed nisource believes that these costs meet the requirements for deferral as regulatory assets regulatory assets requiring specific regulatory action amounted to 1475 million at december 31 2011 if nisource determined that the amounts included as regulatory assets were not recoverable a charge to income would immediately be required to the extent of the unrecoverable amounts 

accounting for risk management activities under asc topic 815 derivatives and hedging  the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and resulting designation unrealized and realized gains and losses are recognized each period as components of accumulated other comprehensive income loss earnings or regulatory assets and liabilities depending on the nature of such derivatives for subsidiaries that utilize derivatives for cash flow hedges the effective portions of the gains and losses are recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income loss and are recognized in earnings concurrent with the disposition of the hedged risks for fair value hedges the gains and losses are recorded in earnings each period along with the change in the fair value of the hedged item as a result of the ratemaking process the rateregulated subsidiaries generally record gains and losses as regulatory liabilities or assets and recognize such gains or losses in earnings when both the contracts settle and the physical commodity flows these gains and losses recognized in earnings are then subsequently recovered or passed back in revenues through rates 

in order for a derivative contract to be designated as a hedge the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item or transaction must be highly effective the effectiveness test is performed at the inception of the hedge and each reporting period thereafter throughout the period that the hedge is designated any amounts determined to be ineffective are recorded currently in earnings 

although nisource applies some judgment in the assessment of hedge effectiveness to designate certain derivatives as hedges the nature of the contracts used to hedge the underlying risks is such that there is a high correlation of the changes in fair values of the derivatives and the underlying risks nisource generally uses nymex exchangetraded natural gas futures and options contracts and overthecounter swaps based on published indices to hedge the risks underlying its naturalgasrelated businesses nisource had 3485 million and 3998 million of price risk management assets of which 567 million and 611 million related to hedges at december 31 2011 and 2010 respectively and 3067 million and 3555 million of price risk management liabilities of which 05 million and 12 million related to hedges at december 31 2011 and 2010 respectively there were no material unrealized gains or losses recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income loss net of taxes as of december 31 2011 and 2010 

pensions and postretirement benefits nisource has defined benefit plans for both pensions and other postretirement benefits the calculation of the net obligations and annual expense related to the plans requires a significant degree of judgment regarding the discount rates to be used in bringing the liabilities to present value longterm returns on plan assets and employee longevity among other assumptions due to the size of the plans and the longterm nature of the associated liabilities changes in the assumptions used in the actuarial estimates could have material impacts on the measurement of the net obligations and annual expense recognition for further discussion of nisource’s pensions and other postretirement benefits see note 12 “pension and other postretirement benefits” in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

goodwill nisource’s goodwill assets at december 31 2011 were 36773 million most of which resulted from the acquisition of columbia on november 1 2000 in addition northern indiana gas distribution operations’ goodwill assets at december 31 2011 related to the purchase of northern indiana fuel and light in march 1993 and kokomo gas in february 1992 were 188 million as required nisource tests for impairment of goodwill on an annual basis and on an interim basis when events or circumstances indicate that a potential impairment may exist nisource’s annual goodwill test takes place in the second quarter of each year and was most recently finalized as of june 30 2011 the goodwill test utilized both an income approach and a market approach in performing the goodwill test nisource made certain required key assumptions such as longterm growth rates discount rates and fair market values 

  

item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

n i s ource i nc  

  

these key assumptions required significant judgment by management which are subjective and forwardlooking in nature to assist in making these judgments nisource utilized thirdparty valuation specialists in both determining and testing key assumptions used in the analysis nisource based its assumptions on projected financial information that it believes is reasonable however actual results may differ materially from those projections nisource used discount rates of 600 for both columbia transmission operations and columbia distribution operations resulting in excess fair values of approximately 1092 million and 412 million respectively the results of the impairment test indicated that each of the reporting units passed step 1 of the impairment test 

goodwill at northern indiana gas distribution operations related to the acquisition of northern indiana fuel and light and kokomo gas of 188 million was also tested for impairment as of june 30 2011 the income approach was used to determine the fair value of the northern indiana gas distribution reporting unit key assumptions in the income approach were a discount rate of 600 and a growth rate based on the cash flow from operations these cash flows factor in the regulatory environment and planned growth initiatives the step 1 goodwill impairment test resulted in the fair value of the northern indiana gas reporting unit to be above the carrying value by 319 million 

although there was no goodwill asset impairment as of june 30 2011 an interim impairment test could be triggered by the following actual earnings results that are materially lower than expected significant adverse changes in the operating environment an increase in the discount rate changes in other key assumptions which require judgment and are forward looking in nature or if nisource’s market capitalization continues to stay below book value for an extended period of time no impairment triggers were identified in the third or fourth quarter of 2011 

refer to notes 1j and 6 “goodwill and other intangible assets” in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 

longlived asset impairment testing  nisource’s consolidated balance sheets contain longlived assets other than goodwill and intangible assets which are not subject to recovery under asc topic 980 regulated operations  as a result nisource assesses the carrying amount and potential earnings of these assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value could be impaired when an asset’s carrying value exceeds the undiscounted estimated future cash flows associated with the asset the asset is considered to be impaired to the extent that the asset’s fair value is less than its carrying value refer to note 1 k “longlived assets” and note 3 “impairments restructuring and other charges” in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 

contingencies a contingent liability is recognized when it is probable that an environmental tax legal or other liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can reasonably be estimated accounting for contingencies requires significant management judgment regarding the estimated probabilities and ranges of exposure to a potential liability estimates of the loss and associated probability are made based on the current facts available including present laws and regulations management’s assessment of the contingent liability could change as a result of future events or as more information becomes available actual amounts could differ from estimates and can have a material impact on nisource’s results of operations and financial position refer to note 20 “other commitments and contingencies” in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 

asset retirement obligations entities are required to record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred in the absence of quoted market prices fair value of asset retirement obligations are estimated using present value techniques using various assumptions including estimates of the amounts and timing of future cash flows associated with retirement activities inflation rates and creditadjusted risk free rates when the liability is initially recorded the entity capitalizes the cost thereby increasing the carrying amount of the related longlived asset over time the liability is accreted and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset the rateregulated subsidiaries defer the difference between the amounts recognized for depreciation and accretion and the amount collected or expected to be collected in rates refer to note 7 “asset retirement obligations” in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information

revenue recognition revenue is recorded as products and services are delivered utility revenues are billed to customers monthly on a cycle basis revenues are recorded on the accrual basis and include estimates for electricity and gas delivered but not billed 

taxes deferred income taxes are recognized for all temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities at currently enacted income tax rates additional deferred income tax assets and liabilities are required for temporary differences where regulators prohibit deferred income tax treatment for ratemaking purposes regulatory assets or liabilities corresponding to such additional deferred tax assets or liabilities may be recorded to the extent recoverable from or payable to customers through the ratemaking process amounts applicable to income taxes due from and due to customers primarily represent differences between the book and tax basis of net utility plant in service

international financial reporting standards 

in december 2011 the sec chief accountant and in january 2012 the sec chairman both indicated that a determination on ifrs would be made in the next few months in february 2010 the sec expressed its commitment to the development of a single set of high quality globally accepted accounting standards and directed its staff to execute a work plan addressing specific areas of concern regarding the potential incorporation of ifrs for the us in october 2010 the sec staff issued its first public progress report on the work plan and in may 2011 a staff paper was issued outlining a possible endorsement approach for incorporation of ifrs into the us financial reporting system as opposed to a singledate approach if the sec were to decide that incorporation of ifrs is in the best interest of us investors under this possible framework ifrs would be incorporated into gaap during a transition period eg five to seven years and the fasb would be retained as the united states standard setter the sec staff issued its third report on ifrs in november 2011 detailing an analysis of ifrs in practice 

in the fourth quarter of 2010 nisource completed a comprehensive assessment of ifrs to understand the key accounting and reporting differences compared to us gaap and to assess the potential organizational process and system impacts that would be required the accounting differences between us gaap and ifrs are complex and significant in many aspects and conversion to ifrs would have broad impacts across nisource in addition to financial statement and disclosure changes converting to ifrs would involve changes to processes and controls regulatory and management reporting financial reporting systems and other areas of the organization as a part of the ifrs assessment project a preliminary conversion roadmap was created for reporting ifrs this ifrs conversion roadmap and nisource’s strategy for addressing a potential mandate of ifrs will be reassessed when the sec makes its determination on whether to require the use of ifrs and by what method 

environmental matters 

nisource is subject to regulation by various federal state and local authorities in the areas of air quality water quality control of toxic substances and hazardous and solid wastes and other environmental matters nisource believes that it is in substantial compliance with those environmental regulations currently applicable to nisource’s business and operations refer to note 20d “environmental matters” in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding environmental matters 

bargaining unit contract 

as of december 31 2011 nisource had 7957 employees of whom 3295 were subject to collective bargaining agreements agreements were reached with the respective unions whose collective bargaining agreements were set to expire during 2011 ten additional collective bargaining contracts covering approximately 513 employees are set to expire during 2012 to date an agreement has been reached and ratified with respect to one of those contracts the remaining nine agreements covering approximately 437 employees expire between march 1 2012 and june 18 2012

2010 health care act 

the 2010 health care act includes a provision eliminating effective january 1 2013 the tax deductibility of retiree health care costs to the extent of federal subsidies received under the retiree drug subsidy program when the retiree drug subsidy was created by the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003 nisource recorded a deferred tax asset reflecting the exclusion of the expected future retiree drug subsidy from taxable income at the same time an offsetting regulatory liability was established to reflect nisource’s obligation to reduce income taxes collected in future rates asc topic 740 income taxes requires the impact of a change in tax law to be immediately recognized in continuing operations in the income statement for the period that includes the enactment date in the first quarter of 2010 nisource reversed its deferred tax asset of 62 million related to previously excludable retiree drug subsidy payments expected to be received after january 1 2013 which was completely offset by the reversal of the related regulatory liability there was no impact on income tax expense recorded in the statements of consolidated income for the period ended december 31 2010 

a provision of the 2010 health care act requires the elimination effective january 1 2011 of lifetime and restrictive annual benefit limits from certain active medical plans the nisource consolidated flex medical plan the “consolidated flex plan” a component welfare benefit plan of the nisource life and medical benefits program covered both active and retired employees and capped lifetime benefits to certain retirees nisource examined the provisions of the 2010 health care act and determined the enactment of the law in the first quarter of 2010 qualified as a significant event requiring remeasurement of other postretirement benefit obligations and plan assets as of march 31 2010 effective september 1 2010 nisource amended the consolidated flex plan and established the nisource post65 retiree medical plan the “post65 retiree plan” as a separate erisa plan in accordance with the amendment of the consolidated flex plan and the establishment of the post65 retiree plan medicare supplement plan options for nisource postage 65 retirees and their eligible postage 65 dependents are now offered under the post65 retiree plan a retireeonly plan and not under the consolidated flex plan the post65 retiree plan is not subject to the provisions of the 2010 health care act requiring elimination of lifetime and restrictive annual benefit limits the amendment of the consolidated flex plan and the establishment of the post65 retiree plan required a second remeasurement of other postretirement benefit obligations and plan assets as of september 1 2010 the effect of the change in the legislation and the plan amendment resulted in an increase to the other postretirement benefit obligation net of plan assets of 310 million and corresponding increases to regulatory assets and aoci of 294 million and 16 million respectively net periodic postretirement benefit cost for 2010 was also increased by approximately 22 million 

doddfrank financial reform act 

the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act “the act” was passed by congress on july 15 2010 and was signed into law on july 21 2010 the act among other things establishes a financial stability oversight council “fsoc” and a consumer financial protection bureau “cfpb” whose duties will include the monitoring of domestic and international financial regulatory proposals and developments as well as the protection of consumers the fsoc may submit comments to the sec and any standardsetting body with respect to an existing or proposed accounting principle standard or procedure the act also creates increased oversight of the overthecounter derivative market requiring certain otc transactions to be cleared through a clearing house and requiring cash margins to be posted for those transactions some regulations have been finalized and more will be issued to implement the act over the next six months nisource is monitoring the rulemaking process under the act although the act and the new regulations are expected to have some impact on capital markets and derivatives markets generally nisource does not expect the act to have any material effect on its operations

results and discussion of segment operations 

presentation of segment information 

operating segments are components of an enterprise for which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance the nisource chief executive officer is the chief operating decision maker 

nisource’s operations are divided into three primary business segments the gas distribution operations segment provides natural gas service and transportation for residential commercial and industrial customers in ohio pennsylvania virginia kentucky maryland indiana and massachusetts the gas transmission and storage operations segment offers gas transportation and storage services for ldcs marketers and industrial and commercial customers located in northeastern midatlantic midwestern and southern states and the district of columbia the electric operations segment provides electric service in 20 counties in the northern part of indiana

 competition 

gas distribution operations competes with investorowned municipal and cooperative electric utilities throughout its service area and to a lesser extent with other regulated natural gas utilities and propane and fuel oil suppliers gas distribution operations continues to be a strong competitor in the energy market as a result of strong customer preference for natural gas competition with providers of electricity is generally strongest in the residential and commercial markets of kentucky southern ohio central pennsylvania and western virginia where electric rates are primarily driven by lowcost coalfired generation in ohio and pennsylvania similar gas provider competition is also common gas competes with fuel oil and propane in the massachusetts market mainly due to the installed base of fuel oil and propanebased heating which over time has comprised a declining percentage of the overall market

market conditions 

during 2011 gas distribution operations gross revenues decreased due to lower natural gas commodity prices experienced throughout the year spot prices at the henry hub for the winter of 20112012 have primarily been in the 280  370dth range compared to prices in the 320  470dth range experienced during the winter of 20102011 year over year demand reflected moderate recovery from the 20092010 lows but the combination of strong supplies unseasonably warm early winter temperatures and storage levels remaining at high levels kept gas prices in a narrow range 

entering the 20112012 winter season national storage levels were 6 bcf below the prior year but 215 bcf ahead of the 5 year average inventory levels based on 11102011 energy information administration storage report as published in the 11112011 gas daily during the summer of 2011 prices ranged between 340 and 492dth which were consistent with those prices experienced in the summer of 2010 

all nisource gas distribution operations companies have stateapproved recovery mechanisms that provide a means for full recovery of prudently incurred gas costs gas costs are treated as passthrough costs and have no impact on the net revenues recorded in the period the gas costs included in revenues are matched with the gas cost expense recorded in the period and the difference is recorded on the consolidated balance sheets as underrecovered or overrecovered gas cost to be included in future customer billings 

the gas distribution operations companies have pursued nontraditional revenue sources within the evolving natural gas marketplace these efforts include the sale of products and services upstream of the companies’ service territory the sale of products and services in the companies’ service territories and gas supply cost incentive mechanisms for service to their core markets the upstream products are made up of transactions that occur between an individual gas distribution operations company and a buyer for the sales of unbundled or rebundled gas supply and capacity the onsystem services are offered by nisource to customers and include products such as the transportation and balancing of gas on the gas distribution operations company system the incentive mechanisms give the gas distribution operations companies an opportunity to share in the savings created from such things as gas purchase prices paid below an agreed upon benchmark and its ability to reduce pipeline capacity charges with their customers certain gas distribution operations companies continue to offer choice opportunities where customers can choose to purchase gas from a third party supplier through regulatory initiatives in their respective jurisdictions 

capital expenditures and other investing activities 

the table below reflects actual capital expenditures and other investing activities by category for 2009 2010 and 2011 and estimates for 2012 

 

 the gas distribution operations segment’s capital expenditures and other investing activities were 5394 million in 2011 and are projected to be 5330 million in 2012 capital expenditures for 2011 were higher than 2010 by approximately 1297 million primarily due to increased spending on infrastructure replacement projects the estimated 2012 capital expenditures are comparable to 2011 and continue to reflect spending on infrastructure replacement programs in ohio kentucky pennsylvania virginia and massachusetts 

capital expenditures for 2010 were higher than 2009 by approximately 665 million primarily due to increased spending on infrastructure replacement projects 

bear garden station 

in august 2008 columbia of virginia entered into an agreement with dominion virginia power to install facilities to serve a 580 mw combined cycle generating station in buckingham county va known as the bear garden station the project required approximately 133 miles of 24inch steel pipeline and associated facilities to serve the station in march 2009 the vscc approved dominion virginia power company’s planned bear garden station columbia of virginia’s facilities constructed to serve the bear garden station were placed into service in july 2010

regulatory matters 

refer to note 8 “regulatory matters” in the notes to consolidated financial statements for information on significant rate developments and cost recovery and trackers for the gas distribution operations segment 

customer usage the nisource distribution companies had experienced declining usage by customers due in large part to the sensitivity of sales to volatility in commodity prices a significant portion of the ldcs’ operating costs are fixed in nature historically rate design at the distribution level has been structured such that a large portion of cost recovery is based upon throughput rather than in a fixed charge in addition increased efficiency of natural gas appliances has caused a decline in average use per customer columbia of ohio restructured its rate design through a base rate proceeding and has adopted a “decoupled” rate design which more closely links the recovery of fixed costs with fixed charges in regulatory proceedings in 2009 columbia of massachusetts and columbia of virginia received approval of decoupling mechanisms which adjust revenues to an approved benchmark level through a volumetric adjustment factor in its 2011 rate case columbia of pennsylvania implemented a higher fixed residential customer charge each of the states in which the nisource ldcs operate has different requirements regarding the procedure for establishing such charges in its 2010 rate case northern indiana implemented a higher fixed customer charge for residential and small customer classes moving toward full straight fixed variable rate design this rate design was also incorporated in the settlement of the 2011 merger of the three indiana ldcs northern indiana kokomo gas and northern indiana fuel and light 

environmental matters 

currently various environmental matters impact the gas distribution operations segment as of december 31 2011 reserves have been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions refer to note 20d “environmental matters” in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the gas distribution operations segment 

restructuring 

refer to note 3 “impairments restructuring and other charges” in the notes to consolidated financial statements for information regarding restructuring initiatives 

weather 

in general nisource calculates the weather related revenue variance based on changing customer demand driven by weather variance from normal heating degreedays normal is evaluated using heating degree days across the nisource distribution region while the temperature base for measuring heating degreedays ie the estimated average daily temperature at which heating load begins varies slightly across the region the nisource composite measurement is based on 65 degrees nisource composite heating degreedays reported do not directly correlate to the weather related dollar impact on the results of gas distribution operations heating degreedays experienced during different times of the year or in different operating locations may have more or less impact on volume and dollars depending on when and where they occur when the detailed results are combined for reporting there may be weather related dollar impacts on operations when there is not an apparent or significant change in the aggregated nisource composite heating degreeday comparison 

weather in the gas distribution operations service territories for 2011 was about 4 warmer than normal and was about 2 warmer than 2010 decreasing net revenues by approximately 6 million for the year ended december 31 2011 compared to 2010 

weather in the gas distribution operations service territories for 2010 was about 2 warmer than normal and was about 1 warmer than 2009 decreasing net revenues by approximately 3 million for the year ended december 31 2010 compared to 2009 

throughput 

total volumes sold and transported for the year ended december 31 2011 were 9179 mmdth compared to 8836 mmdth for 2010 this increase reflected higher throughput to industrial customers attributable mainly to the improved economy nisource throughput reported does not directly correlate to the results of gas distribution operations

total volumes sold and transported for the year ended december 31 2010 were 8836 mmdth compared to 8310 mmdth for 2009 this increase reflected higher sales to industrial customers attributable mainly to the improved economy and higher offsystem sales 

net revenues 

net revenues for 2011 were 15812 million a decrease of 213 million from the same period in 2010 due primarily to a decrease in net regulatory and tax trackers of 518 million which are offset in expense lower offsystem sales of 188 million primarily as a result of the standard service offer auction at columbia of ohio in the second quarter of 2010 and a decrease in industrial margins of 76 million the decreases in net revenues were partially offset by an increase of 303 million for other regulatory and service programs including impacts from the implementation of new rates under columbia of ohio’s approved infrastructure replacement program and rate cases at various nisource ldcs additionally there was an increase of 141 million in residential and commercial margins net revenues also increased 57 million as the result of a contract accrual that was established in 2010 28 million from bear garden station which was placed into service in july of 2010 and 25 million related to a reserve for unaccounted for gas recorded in 2010 

net revenues for 2010 were 16025 million a decrease of 69 million from 2009 this decrease in net revenues was primarily due to decreased regulatory and tax trackers of 204 million offset in expense and decreased residential and commercial margins of 201 million additionally there was an accrual related to a prior period contract established at columbia of massachusetts of 57 million additional customer credits of 56 million issued as the result of a rate case a decrease in forfeited discounts and late payments of 50 million and the impact of warmer weather of approximately 3 million these decreases were partially offset by an increase in regulatory and service programs of 517 million this includes impacts from rate cases at various utilities the implementation of new rates under columbia of ohio’s approved infrastructure replacement program and for the revenue normalization program at columbia of virginia 

at northern indiana sales revenues and customer billings are adjusted for amounts related to under and overrecovered purchased gas costs from prior periods per regulatory order these amounts are primarily reflected in the “other” gross revenues statistic provided at the beginning of this segment discussion the adjustments to other gross revenues for the twelve months ended december 31 2011 and 2010 were a revenue decrease of 1803 million and a revenue increase of 2706 million respectively 

operating income 

for 2011 gas distribution operations reported operating income of 3928 million an increase of 605 million from the comparable 2010 period the increase in operating income was primarily attributable to lower operating expenses partially offset by lower net revenues described above operating expenses decreased 818 million as a result of a decrease of 653 million in depreciation costs primarily due to new approved depreciation rates at northern indiana and 550 million as a result of lower regulatory trackers which are offset in net revenue these decreases were partially offset by an increase in environmental costs of 258 million as a result of the increase in estimated mgp remediation costs and higher employee and administrative costs of 133 million 

for 2010 operating income for the gas distribution operations segment was 3323 million an increase of 51 million compared to the same period in 2009 primarily attributable to lower operating expenses of 120 million partially offset by decreased net revenues described above operating expenses decreased due to lower net regulatory and tax trackers offset in revenue of 204 million decreased uncollectible expenses of 101 million and lower depreciation costs of 88 million primarily due to new approved depreciation rates these decreases in operating expenses were partially offset by increased payroll and benefits expense of 201 million and environmental costs of 33 million

east lateral project in 2010 the gas transmission and storage operations segment initiated a 5 million project to modify existing facilities on the columbia gulf east lateral to provide firm transportation service for up to 300000 dth per day firm transportation contracts for 250000 dth per day were executed for fiveyear terms this fercapproved project was completed and put into service in may 2011 

southern appalachian project the gas transmission and storage operations segment invested nearly 4 million to expand line sm116 to transport approximately 38500 dth per day on a firm basis as a continuation of its strategy to provide transportation services to producers of marcellus and appalachian gas this additional capacity is supported by executed binding precedent agreements these additional facilities were placed in service in april 2011 

growth projects in progress 

power plant generation project the gas transmission and storage operations segment is planning to spend nearly 35 million on an expansion project which includes new pipeline and modifications to existing compression assets with virginia power services energy corporation inc the energy manager for virginia electric power company this project will expand the columbia transmission system in order to provide up to nearly 250000 dth per day of transportation capacity under a longterm firm contract the project is expected to be ready for commercial operations by mid2014 

line wb expansion project the gas transmission and storage operations segment expanded its wb system through investment in additional facilities which provide transportation service on a firm basis from loudoun virginia to leach kentucky the expansion totaled approximately 14 million allowing producers to meet incremental transportation demand in the marcellusappalachian basin binding precedent agreements for approximately 175000 dth per day of firm transportation capacity were executed some which began in january 2011 final construction on all facilities will be completed and placed into service in the first quarter of 2012 

smithfield project the gas transmission and storage operations segment made approximately 14 million of capital investments for modifications to existing pipeline and compressor facilities to accommodate receipt of up to 150000 dth per day of additional marcellus gas from connections near smithfield west virginia and waynesburg pennsylvania three anchor shippers agreed to longterm firm transportation contracts one contract that began in april 2011 and others that began in august 2011 the project is expected to be fully in service in the first quarter 2012

 capital expenditures in the gas transmission and storage operations segment in 2011 decreased by 05 million relative to 2010 the capital expenditure program and other investing activities in 2012 are projected to be approximately 4316 million which is an increase of 1301 million over 2011 the increase from 2011 to 2012 is attributable to system growth primarily in the marcellus shale area 

capital expenditures in the gas transmission and storage operations segment in 2010 increased by 146 million relative to 2009 primarily due to increased expenditures on maintenance projects 

sales and percentage of physical capacity sold 

columbia transmission and columbia gulf compete for transportation customers based on the type of service a customer needs operating flexibility available capacity and price columbia gulf and columbia transmission provide a significant portion of total transportation services under firm contracts and derive a smaller portion of revenues through interruptible contracts with management seeking to maximize the portion of physical capacity sold under firm contracts 

firm service contracts require pipeline capacity to be reserved for a given customer between certain receipt and delivery points firm customers generally pay a “capacity reservation” fee based on the amount of capacity being reserved regardless of whether the capacity is used plus an incremental usage fee when the capacity is used annual capacity reservation revenues derived from firm service contracts generally remain constant over the life of the contract because the revenues are based upon capacity reserved and not whether the capacity is actually used the high percentage of revenue derived from capacity reservation fees mitigates the risk of revenue fluctuations within the gas transmission and storage operations segment due to changes in nearterm supply and demand conditions for 2011 approximately 917 of the transportation revenues were derived from capacity reservation fees paid under firm contracts and 61 of the transportation revenues were derived from usage fees under firm contracts compared to approximately 912 and 56 respectively for 2010 

interruptible transportation service is typically short term in nature and is generally used by customers that either do not need firm service or have been unable to contract for firm service these customers pay a usage fee only for the volume of gas actually transported the ability to provide this service is limited to available capacity not otherwise used by firm customers and customers receiving services under interruptible contracts are not assured capacity in the pipeline facilities gas transmission and storage operations provides interruptible service at competitive prices in order to capture shortterm market opportunities as they occur and interruptible service is viewed by management as an important strategy to optimize revenues from the gas transmission assets for 2011 and 2010 approximately 22 and 32 respectively of the transportation revenues were derived from interruptible contracts 

hartsville compressor station 

in 2008 tornados damaged columbia gulf’s hartsville compressor station in tennessee and immediately thereafter construction began on both temporary and permanent facilities while installation of temporary horsepower was completed and capacity restored damage claims were settled with insurance companies in 2008 late in 2009 construction of a permanent compression solution was completed in early 2010 testing was completed and permanent environmentally advantageous horsepower that is more efficient cleanerburning and quieter was placed into service replacement of the remaining temporary facilities that were constructed to restore system capabilities with a permanent solution was completed in 2010 columbia gulf incurred 04 million 62 million and 122 million in reconstruction costs in 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively 

insurance proceeds attributable to capital replacement related to the aforementioned incident totaled 453 million in 2009 no proceeds were received in 2011 or 2010 at december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 there were no claims outstanding for tornado damages

throughput 

columbia transmission provides transportation and storage services for ldcs and other customers within its market area which covers portions of northeastern midatlantic midwestern and southern states and the district of columbia billed throughput for columbia transmission consists of deliveries off of its system excluding gas delivered to storage for later delivery billed throughput for columbia gulf reflects transportation services for gas delivered through its mainline and laterals crossroads pipeline’s throughput comes from deliveries it makes to its customers and other pipelines that are located in northern indiana and ohio intersegment eliminations represent gas delivered to affiliated pipelines within the segment 

throughput for the gas transmission and storage operations segment totaled 16357 mmdth for 2011 compared to 13975 mmdth for the same period in 2010 the increase of 2382 mmdth was primarily due to increased transportation from the marcellus haynesville and barnett shale areas and increased deliveries to the power generation plants of the ldc’s due to the more advantageous pricing of gas compared to coal additionally there were increased deliveries to local utilities to satisfy heating demand during a colder than normal winter early in 2011 

throughput for the gas transmission and storage operations segment totaled 13975 mmdth for 2010 compared to 13914 mmdth in 2009 the increase of 61 mmdth is due to increased production from the marcellus shale area being offset by reduced receipts elsewhere on the system a warmer than normal summer and colder winter helped keep overall system volumes comparable with 2009 on the columbia gulf system increased throughput out of the haynesville fayetteville and barnett shales have offset declining volumes from gulf of mexico area receipts at the same time the weather mentioned above helped keep demand for gas from columbia gulf to columbia transmission comparable with 2009 

operating revenues 

operating revenues were 10056 million for 2011 an increase of 564 million from the same period in 2010 primarily due to higher demand margin revenue of 323 million as a result of new growth projects additionally there was an increase of 148 million due to the net impact of the rate case filing at columbia gulf net revenues also increased due to increased midstream revenue of 106 million higher mineral rights royalty revenues of 84 million increased regulatory trackers of 59 million which are offset in expense and a onetime settlement of 28 million these increases in net revenues were partially offset by the impact of 83 million related to the recognition in 2010 of revenue for a previously deferred gain for native gas contributed to hardy storage company from columbia transmission following hardy storage securing permanent financing additionally revenues decreased due to lower shorter term transportation and storage services of 67 million and the impact of 54 million of fees received from a contract buyout during the second quarter of 2010 

operating revenues were 9492 million for 2010 an increase of 185 million from 2009 the increase in operating revenues was primarily due to increased demand and commodity margin revenues as a result of the growth projects of 229 million and an increase of 83 million due to the recognition of revenue for a previously deferred gain for native gas contributed to hardy storage from columbia transmission following hardy storage securing permanent financing additionally there was a 56 million increase in regulatory trackers which are offset in expense 54 million of fees received from a contract buyout during the period and a 35 million increase in mineral rights royalty revenues these increases in revenue were partially offset by a decrease in shorter term transportation and storage services of 231 million and a decrease of 91 million in mineral rights leasing revenues

corporate and other operations during the first quarter of 2010 nisource made the decision to wind down the unregulated natural gas marketing activities as a part of the company’s longterm strategy of focusing on its core regulated business 

divestiture of noncore assets in recent years nisource sold certain businesses judged to be noncore to nisource’s strategy nisource sold whiting clean energy to bpae in april 2008 for 2167 million which included 161 million in working capital in december 2008 nisource sold northern utilities and granite state gas for 2091 million which included 491 million in working capital columbia gulf sold a portion of columbia gulf’s offshore assets to tennessee gas pipeline in june 2008 lake erie land a whollyowned subsidiary of nisource sold its sand creek golf club assets in june 2006 to a private real estate developer lake erie land is pursuing the sale of certain other real estate assets it owns nisource corporate services is continuing to work with potential buyers to sell its marble cliff facility in the fourth quarter of 2010 nisource corporate services executed a purchase and sale agreement of the marble cliff facility with the closing date planned in the first quarter 2011 ndc douglas properties a subsidiary of nisource development company is in the process of exiting some of its low income housing investments 

business strategy nisource focuses its business strategy on its core rateregulated assetbased businesses with virtually 100 of its operating income generated from the rateregulated businesses with the nation’s fourth largest natural gas pipeline the largest natural gas distribution network east of the rocky mountains and one of the nation’s largest natural gas storage networks nisource operates throughout the energyintensive corridor that extends from the supply areas in the gulf coast through the consumption centers in the midwest midatlantic new england and northeast this corridor includes over 40 of the nation’s population and close to 50 of its natural gas consumption nisource continues to position its assets to meet the corridor’s growing energy needs 

competition and changes in the regulatory environment the regulatory frameworks applicable to nisource’s operations at both the state and federal levels continue to evolve these changes have had and will continue to have an impact on nisource’s operations structure and profitability management continually seeks new ways to be more competitive and profitable in this changing environment including providing gas customers with increased choices for products and services 

natural gas competition  open access to natural gas supplies over interstate pipelines and the deregulation of the commodity price of gas has led to tremendous change in the energy markets ldc customers and marketers 

  item 1 business 

nisource inc 

purchase gas directly from producers and marketers as an open competitive market for gas supplies has emerged this separation or “unbundling” of the transportation and other services offered by pipelines and ldcs allows customers to purchase the commodity independent of services provided by the pipelines and ldcs the ldcs continue to purchase gas and recover the associated costs from their customers nisource’s gas distribution operations’ subsidiaries are involved in programs that provide customers the opportunity to purchase their natural gas requirements from third parties and use the nisource gas distribution operations’ subsidiaries for transportation services

 item 1a risk factors 

nisource inc 

there are many factors that could have a material adverse effect on nisource’s operating results financial condition and cash flows new risks may emerge at any time and nisource cannot predict those risks or estimate the extent to which they may affect financial performance each of the risks described below could adversely impact the value of nisource’s securities 

nisource has substantial indebtedness which could adversely affect its financial condition 

nisource had total consolidated indebtedness of 73528 million outstanding as of december 31 2010 the substantial indebtedness could have important consequences to investors for example it could 

 

some of nisource’s debt obligations contain financial covenants related to debttocapital ratios and crossdefault provisions nisource’s failure to comply with any of these covenants could result in an event of default which if not cured or waived could result in the acceleration of outstanding debt obligations additionally a drop in nisource’s credit rating could adversely impact the cost for nisource to issue new debt securities 

a drop in nisource’s credit rating could adversely impact nisource’s liquidity 

on december 14 2010 fitch affirmed the senior unsecured ratings for nisource at bbb and the existing ratings of all other subsidiaries fitch’s outlook for nisource and all of its subsidiaries is stable on november 19 2010 moody’s investors service affirmed the senior unsecured ratings for nisource at baa3 and the existing ratings of all other subsidiaries moody’s outlook for nisource and all of its subsidiaries is stable on february 24 2011 standard  poor’s affirmed the senior unsecured ratings for nisource and its subsidiaries at bbb standard  poor’s outlook for nisource and all of its subsidiaries is stable although all ratings continue to be investment grade a downgrade by standard  poor’s moody’s or fitch would result in a rating that is below investment grade 

certain nisource affiliates have agreements that contain “ratings triggers” that require increased collateral if the credit ratings of nisource or certain of its subsidiaries are rated below bbb by standard  poor’s or baa3 by moody’s the additional collateral that would be required in the event of a downgrade below the ratings trigger levels would amount to approximately 181 million in addition to agreements with ratings triggers there are other agreements that contain “adequate assurance” or “material adverse change” provisions that could necessitate additional credit support such as letters of credit and cash collateral to transact business in addition under northern indiana’s trade receivables sales program an event of termination occurs if northern indiana’s debt rating is withdrawn by either standard  poor’s or moody’s or falls below bb or ba2 at either standard  poor’s or moody’s respectively likewise under columbia of ohio’s and columbia of pennsylvania’s trade receivables sales programs an event of termination occurs if nisource’s debt rating is withdrawn by either standard  poor’s or moody’s or falls below bb or ba3 at either standard  poor’s or moody’s respectively 

additionally as a result of nisource’s participation in certain derivative activities a credit downgrade could cause nisource to be required to post substantial collateral in support of past and current transactions these collateral requirements combined with other potential negative effects on nisource’s liquidity in the event of a credit downgrade below an investment grade rating could have a material adverse effect on earnings potential and cash 

  item 1a risk factors 

nisource inc 

flows lastly a credit downgrade could adversely affect the availability and cost of capital needed to fund the growth investments which are a central element of the company’s longterm business strategy 

nisource may not be able to execute its growth strategy as planned 

because of changes in the business or regulatory environment nisource may not be able to execute its fourpart business plan as intended nisource’s commercial and regulatory initiatives may not achieve planned results levels of commercial growth and expansion of the gas transmission and storage business may be less than its plan has anticipated and the actual results of nisource’s financial management of the balance sheet and process and expense management could deviate materially from planned outcomes 

adverse economic and market conditions or increases in interest rates could reduce net revenue growth increase costs decrease future net income and cash flows and impact capital resources and liquidity needs 

while the national economy is experiencing some recovery from the recent downturn nisource cannot predict how robust the recovery will be or whether or not it will be sustained 

continued sluggishness in the economy impacting nisource’s operating jurisdictions could adversely impact nisource’s ability to grow its customer base and collect revenues from customers which could reduce net revenue growth and increase operating costs an increase in the interest rates nisource pays would adversely affect future net income and cash flows in addition nisource depends on debt to finance its operations including both working capital and capital expenditures and would be adversely affected by increases in interest rates the slow rate of the current economic recovery and tightened credit markets coupled with nisource’s credit ratings could impact nisource’s ability to raise additional capital or refinance debt at a reasonable cost refer to note 16 “longterm debt” in the notes to consolidated financial statements for information related to outstanding longterm debt and maturities of that debt 

capital market performance and other factors may decrease the value of benefit plan assets which then could require significant additional funding and impact earnings 

the performance of the capital markets affects the value of the assets that are held in trust to satisfy future obligations under defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans nisource has significant obligations in these areas and holds significant assets in these trusts these assets are subject to market fluctuations and may yield uncertain returns which fall below nisource’s projected rates of return a decline in the market value of assets may increase the funding requirements of the obligations under the defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans additionally changes in interest rates affect the liabilities under these benefit plans as interest rates decrease the liabilities increase which could potentially increase funding requirements further the funding requirements of the obligations related to these benefits plans may increase due to changes in governmental regulations and participant demographics including increased numbers of retirements or changes in life expectancy assumptions ultimately significant funding requirements and increased pension expense could negatively impact nisource’s results of operations and financial position 

the majority of nisource’s net revenues is subject to economic regulation and is exposed to the impact of regulatory rate reviews and proceedings 

virtually all of nisource’s net revenues are subject to economic regulation at either the federal or state level as such the net revenues generated by those regulated companies are subject to regulatory review by the applicable federal or state authority these rate reviews determine the energy rates charged to customers and directly impact revenues nisource’s financial results are dependent on more frequent regulatory proceedings in order to ensure timely recovery of costs for example the outcome of the currently pending 2010 electric rate case could have a material effect on nisource’s financial results additionally the costs of complying with future changes in environmental laws and regulations are expected to be significant and their recovery through rates will be contingent on regulatory approval 

as a result of efforts to introduce marketbased competition in certain of the markets where the regulated businesses conduct operations nisource may compete with independent marketers for customers this competition exposes nisource to the risk that certain stranded costs may not be recoverable and may affect results of nisource’s growth strategy and cash flows 

nisource’s costs of compliance with environmental laws are significant the costs of compliance with future environmental laws and the recognition of environmental liabilities could impact cash flow and profitability 

nisource’s subsidiaries are subject to extensive federal state and local environmental requirements that among other things regulate air emissions water usage and discharges remediation and the management of chemicals hazardous waste solid waste and coal combustion residuals compliance with these legal obligations requires nisource to make expenditures for installation of pollution control equipment remediation environmental monitoring emissions fees and permits at many of nisource’s facilities these expenditures are significant and nisource expects that they will continue to be significant in the future furthermore if nisource’s subsidiaries fail to comply with environmental laws and regulations or cause harm to the environment or persons even if caused by factors beyond nisource’s control that failure or harm may result in the assessment of civil or criminal penalties and damages against nisource and its subsidiaries 

  item 1a risk factors 

nisource inc 

  existing environmental laws and regulations may be revised and new laws and regulations seeking to protect the environment may be adopted or become applicable to nisource’s subsidiaries revised or additional laws and regulations could result in significant additional expense and operating restrictions on nisource’s facilities or increased compliance costs which may not be fully recoverable from customers and would therefore reduce net income moreover such costs could materially affect the continued economic viability of one or more of nisource’s facilities 

because nisource operations deal with natural gas and coal fossil fuels emissions of ghgs are an expected aspect of the business while nisource attempts to reduce ghg emissions through efficiency programs leak detection and other programs ghg emissions cannot be entirely eliminated the current administration has made it clear that they are focused on reducing ghg emissions through legislation andor regulation imposing statutory or regulatory restrictions andor costs on ghg emissions could increase nisource’s cost of producing energy which could impact customer demand or nisource’s profitability compliance costs associated with these requirements could also affect nisource’s cash flow the cost impact of any new or amended ghg legislation or regulations would depend upon the specific requirements enacted and cannot be determined at this time 

even in instances where legal and regulatory requirements are already known the original estimates for cleanup and environmental capital projects can differ materially from the amount ultimately expended the actual future expenditures depend on many factors including the nature and extent of contamination the method of cleanup the cost of raw materials contractor costs and the availability of cost recovery from customers changes in costs could affect nisource’s financial position and cash flows 

a significant portion of the gas and electricity nisource sells is used by residential and commercial customers for heating and air conditioning accordingly the operating results fluctuate depending on the weather and to a certain extent usage of gas or electricity 

energy sales are sensitive to variations in weather forecasts of energy sales are based on normal weather which represents a longterm historical average significant variations from normal weather could have and have had a material impact on energy sales additionally residential usage and to some degree commercial usage have shown to be sensitive to fluctuations in commodity costs for gas and electricity whereby usage declines with increased costs thus affecting nisource’s financial results lastly residential and commercial customers’ usage has shown to be sensitive to economic conditions and the impact of macroeconomic drivers such as unemployment consumption and consumer confidence which could also affect nisource’s financial results 

nisource’s business operations are subject to economic conditions in certain industries 

business operations throughout nisource’s service territories have been and may continue to be adversely affected by economic events at the national and local level where it operates in particular sales to large industrial customers may be impacted by economic downturns the us manufacturing industry continues to adjust to changing market conditions including international competition increasing costs and fluctuating demand for their products 

  item 1a risk factors 

nisource inc 

fluctuations in the price of energy commodities or their related transportation costs may have a negative impact on nisource’s financial results 

nisource’s electric generating fleet is dependent on coal and natural gas for fuel and its gas distribution operations purchase and resell much of the natural gas they deliver these energy commodities are vulnerable to price fluctuations and fluctuations in associated transportation costs hedging activities have been deployed in order to offset fluctuations in commodity supply prices and nisource relies on regulatory recovery mechanisms in the various jurisdictions in order to fully recover the costs incurred in operations however while nisource has historically been successful in recovery of costs related to such commodity prices there can be no assurance that such costs will be fully recovered through rates in a timely manner additionally increased gas and electricity costs could result in reduced demand from customers as a result of increased conservation activities 

nisource is exposed to risk that customers will not remit payment for delivered energy or services and that suppliers or counterparties will not perform under various financial or operating agreements 

nisource’s extension of credit is governed by a corporate credit risk policy involves considerable judgment and is based on an evaluation of a customer or counterparty’s financial condition credit history and other factors credit risk exposure is monitored by obtaining credit reports and updated financial information for customers and suppliers and by evaluating the financial status of its banking partners and other counterparties through the use of marketbased metrics such as credit default swap pricing levels and also through traditional credit ratings provided by the major credit rating agencies continued adverse economic conditions could increase credit risk and could result in a material adverse effect on nisource 

nisource has significant goodwill and definitelived intangible assets an impairment of goodwill or definitelived intangible assets could result in a significant charge to earnings 

in accordance with gaap nisource tests goodwill for impairment at least annually and reviews its definitelived intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable goodwill would also be tested for impairment when factors examples of which include reduced cash flow estimates a sustained decline in stock price or market capitalization below book value indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable nisource would be required to record a charge in the financial statements during the period in which any impairment of the goodwill or definitelived intangible assets is determined negatively impacting the results of operations a significant charge could impact the capitalization ratio covenant under the fiveyear revolving credit facility this covenant requires nisource to maintain a debt to capitalization ratio that does not exceed 70 a similar covenant in the 2005 private placement note purchase agreement requires nisource to maintain a debt to capitalization ratio that does not exceed 75 

changes in taxation and the ability to quantify such changes could adversely affect nisource’s financial results 

nisource is subject to taxation by the various taxing authorities at the federal state and local levels where it does business legislation or regulation which could affect nisource’s tax burden could be enacted by any of these governmental authorities nisource cannot predict the timing or extent of such taxrelated developments which could have a negative impact on the financial results additionally nisource uses its best judgment in attempting to quantify and reserve for these tax obligations however a challenge by a taxing authority nisource’s ability to utilize tax benefits such as carryforwards or tax credits or a deviation from other taxrelated assumptions may cause actual financial results to deviate from previous estimates 

  item 1a risk factors 

nisource inc 

changes in accounting principles may adversely affect nisource’s financial results 

future changes in accounting rules such as ifrs and associated changes in regulatory accounting may negatively impact the way nisource records revenues expenses assets and liabilities these changes in accounting standards may adversely affect its financial results 

transporting and storing natural gas involves numerous risks that may result in accidents and other operating risks and costs 

our gas distribution and storage activities involve a variety of inherent hazards and operating risks such as leaks accidents including third party damages and mechanical problems which could cause substantial financial losses in addition these risks could result in serious injury to employees and nonemployees loss of human life significant damage to property environmental pollution and impairment of our operations which in turn could lead to substantial losses to us in accordance with customary industry practice we maintain insurance against some but not all of these risks and losses the location of pipelines and storage facilities near populated areas including residential areas commercial business centers and industrial sites could increase the level of damages resulting from these risks the occurrence of any of these events not fully covered by insurance could adversely affect our financial position and results of operations 

aging infrastructure may lead to increased costs and disruptions in operations that could negatively impact nisource’s financial results 

nisource has risks associated with aging infrastructure assets the age of these assets may result in a higher level of maintenance costs and may be susceptible to unscheduled outages despite diligent efforts by nisource to properly maintain these assets through inspection scheduled maintenance and capital investment the failure to operate these assets as desired could result in nisource’s inability to meet firm service obligations adversely impact revenues and could result in increased expenses which may not be fully recoverable from customers 

climate change natural disasters acts of terrorism or other catastrophic events may disrupt operations and reduce the ability to service customers 

a disruption or failure of natural gas transmission storage or distribution systems or within electric generation transmission or distribution systems in the event of a major hurricane tornado terrorist attack or other catastrophic event could cause delays in completing sales providing services or performing other critical functions nisource has experienced disruptions in the past from hurricanes and tornadoes and other events of this nature the cost availability and sufficiency of insurance for these risks could adversely affect nisource’s results of operations financial position and cash flows 

there is also a concern that climate change may exacerbate the risks to physical infrastructure associated with heat and extreme weather conditions climate change and the costs that may be associated with its impacts have the potential to affect nisource’s business in many ways including increasing the cost nisource incurs in providing its products and services impacting the demand for and consumption of its products and services due to change in both costs and weather patterns and affecting the economic health of the regions in which nisource operates 

growing nisource’s business by constructing new pipelines and other facilities subjects nisource to construction risks and natural gas supply risks 

nisource gas transmission  storage operations continues to complete and advance customerdriven growth projects across its system primarily surrounding the marcellus shale production area in the states of pennsylvania and west virginia these growth projects may include constructing or purchasing pipelines and treatment and processing facilities which subjects nisource to construction risks and risks that gas supplies will not be available if nisource undertakes these projects it may not be able to complete them on schedule or at the anticipated costs nisource may construct or purchase these projects to capture anticipated future growth in production in the region which may not materialize and the construction may occur over an extended period of time and nisource will not receive material increases in revenue and cash flows until after the completion of the project nisource competes for these projects with companies of varying size and financial capabilities including some that may have advantages competing for natural gas and liquid gas supplies as well as acquisitions and other business opportunities 

sustained extreme weather conditions may negatively impact nisource’s operations 

nisource conducts its operations across a wide geographic area subject to varied and potentially extreme weather conditions which may from time to time persist for sustained periods of time despite preventative maintenance efforts persistent weather related stress on nisource’s infrastructure may reveal weaknesses in its systems not previously known to the company or otherwise present various operational challenges across all business segments although nisource makes every effort to plan for weather related contingencies adverse weather may affect its ability to conduct operations in a manner that satisfies customer expectations or contractual obligations the company endeavors to minimize such service disruptions but may not be able to avoid them altogether 

  item 1a risk factors 

nisource inc 

growing competition in the gas transportation industry could result in the failure by customers to renew existing contracts 

as a consequence of the increase in competition in the industry and the shift in natural gas production areas end users and ldcs may be reluctant to enter into longterm service contracts the renewal or replacement of existing contracts with nisource’s customers at rates sufficient to maintain current or projected revenues and cash flows depends on a number of factors beyond its control including competition from other pipelines gatherers the proximity of supplies to the markets and the price of and demand for natural gas the inability of nisource to renew or replace its current contracts as they expire and respond appropriately to changing market conditions could materially impact its financial results

other operations 

nisource has made a decision to significantly scale back the unregulated natural gas marketing activities the move is part of nisource’s longterm strategy of focusing on its core regulated businesses nisource has notified its current customers of this decision 

divestiture of noncore assets 

in recent years nisource sold certain businesses judged to be noncore to nisource’s strategy nisource sold whiting clean energy to bpae in april 2008 for 2167 million which included 161 million in working capital in december 2008 nisource sold northern utilities and granite state gas for 2091 million which included 491 million in working capital columbia gulf sold a portion of columbia gulf’s offshore assets to tennessee gas pipeline in june 2008 lake erie land a whollyowned subsidiary of nisource sold its sand creek golf club assets in june 2006 to a private real estate developer lake erie land is pursuing the sale of certain other real estate assets it owns nisource corporate services is continuing to work with several potential buyers to sell its marble cliff facility ndc douglas properties a subsidiary of nisource development company is in the process of exiting some of its low income housing investments 

business strategy 

nisource focuses its business strategy on its core rateregulated assetbased businesses with virtually 100 of its operating income generated from the rateregulated businesses with the nation’s fourth largest natural gas pipeline 

   

nisource inc 

the largest natural gas distribution network east of the rocky mountains and one of the nation’s largest natural gas storage networks nisource operates throughout the energyintensive corridor that extends from the supply areas in the gulf coast through the consumption centers in the midwest midatlantic new england and northeast this corridor includes over 40 of the nation’s population and close to 50 of its natural gas consumption nisource continues to position its assets to meet the corridor’s growing energy needs 

competition and changes in the regulatory environment 

the regulatory frameworks applicable to nisource’s operations at both the state and federal levels continue to evolve these changes have had and will continue to have an impact on nisource’s operations structure and profitability management continually seeks new ways to be more competitive and profitable in this changing environment including providing gas customers with increased choices for products and services 

natural gas competition open access to natural gas supplies over interstate pipelines and the deregulation of the commodity price of gas has led to tremendous change in the energy markets ldc customers and marketers purchase gas directly from producers and marketers and an open competitive market for gas supplies has emerged this separation or “unbundling” of the transportation and other services offered by pipelines and ldcs allows customers to purchase the commodity independent of services provided by the pipelines and ldcs the ldcs continue to purchase gas and recover the associated costs from their customers nisource’s gas distribution operations’ subsidiaries are involved in programs that provide customers the opportunity to purchase their natural gas requirements from third parties and use the nisource gas distribution operations’ subsidiaries for transportation services 

electric competition northern indiana currently dispatches all power from its plants into the miso transmission service for northern indiana occurs under the miso open access transmission tariff

 item 1a   risk factors tableend 

nisource inc 

there are many factors that could have a material adverse effect on nisource’s operating results financial condition and cash flows new risks may emerge at any time and nisource cannot predict those risks or estimate the extent to which they may affect financial performance each of the risks described below could adversely impact the value of nisource’s securities 

nisource has substantial indebtedness which could adversely affect its financial condition 

nisource has a significant amount of indebtedness outstanding in part as a result of the acquisitions of columbia and bay state nisource had total consolidated indebtedness of 67874 million outstanding as of december 31 2009 the substantial indebtedness could have important consequences to investors for example it could 

 

some of nisource’s debt obligations contain financial covenants related to debttocapital ratios and crossdefault provisions nisource’s failure to comply with any of these covenants could result in an event of default which if not cured or waived could result in the acceleration of outstanding debt obligations additionally a drop in nisource’s credit rating could adversely impact the cost for nisource to issue new debt securities 

a drop in nisource’s credit rating could adversely impact nisource’s liquidity 

on december 15 2009 fitch affirmed the senior unsecured ratings for nisource at bbb and the existing ratings of all other rated subsidiaries fitch’s outlook for nisource and all of its rated subsidiaries is stable on november 24 2009 moody’s investors service affirmed the senior unsecured ratings for nisource at baa3 and the existing ratings of all other rated subsidiaries and revised the outlook to stable from negative on march 5 2009 standard and poor’s affirmed its senior unsecured ratings for nisource and its rated subsidiaries at bbb and revised the outlook to stable from negative although all ratings continue to be investment grade a downgrade by standard and poor’s moody’s or fitch would result in a rating that is below investment grade 

certain nisource affiliates have agreements that contain “ratings triggers” that require increased collateral if the credit ratings of nisource or certain of its subsidiaries are rated below bbb by standard and poor’s or baa3 by moody’s the additional collateral that would be required in the event of a downgrade below the ratings trigger levels would amount to approximately 24 million in addition to agreements with ratings triggers there are other agreements that contain “adequate assurance” or “material adverse change” provisions that could necessitate additional credit support such as letters of credit and cash collateral to transact business in addition under northern indiana’s trade receivables sales program it is an event of termination if northern indiana’s debt rating is withdrawn by either standard and poor’s or moody’s or falls below bb or ba2 at either standard and poor’s or moody’s respectively likewise under columbia of ohio’s trade receivables sales program it is an event of termination if nisource’s debt rating is withdrawn by either standard and poor’s or moody’s or falls below bb or ba3 at either standard and poor’s or moody’s respectively 

additionally as a result of nisource’s participation in certain derivative activities a credit downgrade could cause nisource to be required to post substantial collateral in support of past and current operations these collateral requirements combined with other potential negative effects on nisource’s liquidity in the event of a credit downgrade below an investment grade rating could have a material adverse effect on earnings potential and cash flows 

lastly a credit downgrade could adversely affect the availability and cost of capital needed to fund the growth investments which are a central element of the company’s longterm business strategy 

   

nisource inc 

nisource may not be able to execute its growth strategy as planned 

because of changes in the business environment and business strategy nisource may not be able to execute its fourpart business plan as intended our commercial and regulatory initiatives may not achieve planned results levels of commercial growth and expansion of the gas transmission and storage business may be less than our plan has anticipated and the actual results of our financial management of the balance sheet and process and expense management could deviate materially from planned outcomes 

continued adverse economic and market conditions or increases in interest rates could reduce net revenue growth increase costs decrease future net income and cash flows and impact capital resources and liquidity needs 

the credit markets and the general economy have been experiencing a period of largescale turmoil and upheaval characterized by the bankruptcy failure collapse or sale of various financial institutions and an unprecedented level of intervention from the united states federal government while the ultimate outcome of these events cannot be predicted it may have an adverse material effect on nisource 

a continued decline in the economy impacting nisource’s operating jurisdictions could adversely affect nisource’s ability to grow its customer base and collect revenues from customers which could reduce net revenue growth and increase operating costs an increase in the interest rates nisource pays would adversely affect future net income and cash flows in addition nisource depends on debt to finance its operations including both working capital and capital expenditures and would be adversely affected by increases in interest rates the current economic downturn and tightening of access to credit markets coupled with nisource’s current credit ratings could impact nisource’s ability to raise additional capital or refinance debt at a reasonable cost refer to note 16 “longterm debt” in the notes to consolidated financial statements for information related to outstanding longterm debt and maturities of that debt 

capital market performance and other factors may decrease the value of benefit plan assets which then could require significant additional funding and impact earnings 

the performance of the capital markets affects the value of the assets that are held in trust to satisfy future obligations under defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans nisource has significant obligations in these areas and holds significant assets in these trusts these assets are subject to market fluctuations and may yield uncertain returns which fall below nisource’s projected rates of return a decline in the market value of assets may increase the funding requirements of the obligations under the defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans additionally changes in interest rates affect the liabilities under these benefit plans as interest rates decrease the liabilities increase which could potentially increase funding requirements further the funding requirements of the obligations related to these benefits plans may increase due to changes in governmental regulations and participant demographics including increased numbers of retirements or changes in life expectancy assumptions ultimately significant funding requirements and increased pension expense could negatively impact nisource’s results of operations and financial position 

nisource’s costs of compliance with environmental laws are significant the costs of compliance with future environmental laws and the incurrence of environmental liabilities could impact cash flow and profitability 

nisource’s subsidiaries are subject to extensive federal state and local environmental requirements that among other things regulate air emissions water usage and discharges remediation and the management of chemicals hazardous waste and solid waste compliance with these legal obligations requires nisource to make expenditures for installation of pollution control equipment remediation environmental monitoring emissions fees and permits at many of nisource’s facilities these expenditures are significant and nisource expects that they will continue to be significant in the future 

if nisource’s subsidiaries fail to comply with environmental laws and regulations or cause harm to the environment or persons even if caused by factors beyond nisource’s control that failure or harm may result in the assessment of civil or criminal penalties and damages against nisource and its subsidiaries in september 2004 the epa issued an nov to northern indiana alleging violations of the new source review provisions of the caa an adverse 

   

nisource inc 

outcome in this matter could require capital expenditures beyond the epa requirements that cannot be determined at this time and could require payment of substantial penalties 

existing environmental laws and regulations may be revised and new laws and regulations seeking to protect the environment may be adopted or become applicable to nisource’s subsidiaries revised or additional laws and regulations could result in significant additional expense and operating restrictions on nisource’s facilities or increased compliance costs which may not be fully recoverable from customers and would therefore reduce net income the cost impact of any new or amended legislation would depend upon the specific requirements enacted and cannot be determined at this time 

because nisource operations deal with natural gas and coal fossil fuels emissions of ghgs are an expected aspect of the business while nisource attempts to reduce ghg emissions through efficiency programs leak detection and other programs ghg emissions cannot be entirely eliminated future legislative and regulatory programs could significantly restrict emissions of ghgs or could impose a cost or tax on ghg emissions recently proposals have been developed to implement state and regional ghg programs to create federal legislation to limit ghg emissions such as the waxmanmarkey bill which passed the us house of representatives and the kerryboxer draft bill which is currently being debated in the us senate and to create national renewable portfolio standards in addition in december 2009 the epa declared carbon dioxide and several other ghg to be a danger to public health and welfare which is the first step towards the epa regulating ghg under the caa imposing statutory or regulatory restrictions andor costs on ghg emissions could increase nisource’s cost of producing energy which could impact customer demand or nisource’s profitability compliance costs associated with these requirements could also affect nisource’s cash flow the cost impact of any new or amended legislation would depend upon the specific requirements enacted and cannot be determined at this time 

the federal government continues to show interest in developing regulations covering coal combustion byproducts legislation regulating coal ash pursuant to the surface mining control and reclamation act has been introduced and the epa is reviewing its previous determination that federal regulation of coal ash as a rcra subtitle c hazardous waste is not appropriate the epa intends to propose regulation of coal combustion byproducts in early 2010 these proposed regulations could affect northern indiana’s ongoing byproduct reuse programs and could impose additional requirements on its management of coal ash wastes northern indiana will monitor developments in this matter and cannot estimate the potential financial impact at this time 

a significant portion of the gas and electricity nisource sells is used by residential and commercial customers for heating and air conditioning accordingly the operating results fluctuate depending on the weather and to a certain extent usage of gas or electricity 

energy sales are sensitive to variations in weather forecasts of energy sales are based on normal weather which represents a longterm historical average significant variations from normal weather could have and have had a material impact on energy sales additionally residential usage and to some degree commercial usage have shown to be sensitive to fluctuations in commodity costs for gas and electricity whereby usage declines with increased costs thus affecting nisource’s financial results lastly residential and commercial customers’ usage has shown to be sensitive to economic conditions and the impact of macroeconomic drivers such as unemployment consumption and consumer confidence which could also affect nisource’s financial results 

nisource’s business operations are subject to economic conditions in certain industries 

business operations throughout nisource’s service territories have been and may continue to be adversely affected by economic events at the national and local level where we operate in particular sales to large industrial customers may be impacted by economic downturns the us manufacturing industry continues to adjust to changing market conditions including international competition increasing costs and fluctuating demand for their products 

the majority of nisource’s net revenues is subject to economic regulation and is exposed to the impact of regulatory rate reviews and proceedings 

   

nisource inc 

virtually all of nisource’s net revenues are subject to economic regulation at either the federal or state level as such the net revenues generated by those regulated companies are subject to regulatory review by the applicable federal or state authority these rate reviews determine the energy rates charged to customers and directly impact revenues nisource’s financial results are dependent on more frequent regulatory proceedings in order to ensure timely recovery of costs for example the outcome of the currently pending electric rate case and the electric and gas rate cases anticipated to be filed in 2010 could have a material effect on nisource’s financial results additionally the costs of complying with future changes in environmental laws and regulations are expected to be significant and their recovery through rates will be contingent on regulatory approval 

as a result of efforts to introduce marketbased competition in certain of the markets where the regulated businesses conduct operations nisource may compete with independent marketers for customers this competition exposes nisource to the risk that certain stranded costs may not be recoverable and may affect results of nisource’s growth strategy and cash flows 

fluctuations in the price or supply of fuel commodities or their related transportation costs may have a negative impact on our financial results 

much of the electric generating fleet is dependent on coal as a result nisource’s profitable operation of these assets is vulnerable to price fluctuations fuel supply disruptions and fluctuations in associated transportation costs continuing access to natural gas supplies is also critical to serve utility gas customers hedging activities have been deployed in order to offset fluctuations in commodity supply prices and nisource relies on regulatory recovery mechanisms in the various jurisdictions in order to fully recover the costs incurred in operations however while nisource has historically been successful in recovery of costs related to commodity costs there can be no assurance that such costs will be fully recovered through rates additionally increased gas and electricity costs could result in reduced demand from customers as a result of increased conservation activities 

nisource is exposed to risk that customers will not remit payment for delivered energy or services and that suppliers or counterparties will not perform under various financial or operating agreements 

nisource’s extension of credit is governed by a corporate credit risk policy involves considerable judgment and is based on an evaluation of a customer or counterparty’s financial condition credit history and other factors credit risk exposure is monitored by obtaining credit reports and updated financial information for customers and suppliers and by evaluating the financial status of its banking partners and other counterparties through the use of marketbased metrics such as credit default swap pricing levels and also through traditional credit ratings provided by the major credit rating agencies continued adverse economic conditions could increase credit risk and could result in a material adverse effect on nisource 

nisource has significant goodwill and definitelived intangible assets an impairment of goodwill or definitelived intangible assets could result in a significant charge to earnings 

in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles nisource tests goodwill for impairment at least annually and reviews its definitelived intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable goodwill would also be tested for impairment when factors examples of which include reduced cash flow estimates a sustained decline in stock price or market capitalization below book value indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable nisource would be required to record a charge in the financial statements during the period in which any impairment of the goodwill or definitelived intangible assets is determined negatively impacting the results of operations a significant charge could impact the capitalization ratio covenant under the fiveyear revolving credit facility this covenant requires nisource to maintain a debt to capitalization ratio that does not exceed 70 a similar covenant in the 2005 private placement requires nisource to maintain a debt to capitalization ratio that does not exceed 75 

changes in taxation and our ability to quantify such changes could adversely affect nisource’s financial results 

nisource is subject to taxation by the various taxing authorities at the federal state and local levels where it does business legislation or regulation which could affect nisource’s tax burden could be enacted by any of these governmental authorities nisource cannot predict the timing or extent of such taxrelated developments which could have a negative impact on the financial results additionally nisource uses its best judgment in attempting to quantify and reserve for these tax obligations however a challenge by a taxing authority our ability to utilize tax 

   

nisource inc 

benefits such as carryforwards or tax credits or a deviation from other taxrelated assumptions may cause actual financial results to deviate from previous estimates 

changes in accounting principles may adversely affect nisource’s financial results 

future changes in accounting rules such as ifrs and associated changes in regulatory accounting may negatively impact the way nisource records revenues expenses assets and liabilities these changes in accounting standards may adversely affect its financial results 

aging infrastructure may lead to increased costs and disruptions in operations which could negatively impact our financial results 

nisource has risks associated with aging infrastructure assets the age of these assets may result in them being more costly to maintain and susceptible to unscheduled outages in spite of diligent efforts by nisource to properly maintain these assets through inspection scheduled maintenance and capital investment the failure of such assets could result in increased expenses which may not be fully recoverable from customers andor a reduction in revenue 

climate change natural disasters acts of terrorism or other catastrophic events may disrupt operations and reduce the ability to service customers 

a disruption or failure of natural gas transmission storage or distribution systems or within electric generation transmission or distribution systems in the event of a major hurricane tornado terrorist attack or other catastrophic event could cause delays in completing sales providing services or performing other critical functions nisource has experienced disruptions in the past from hurricanes and tornadoes and other events of this nature the cost availability and sufficiency of insurance for these risks could adversely affect nisource’s results of operations financial position and cash flows 

there is also a concern that climate change may exacerbate the risks to physical infrastructure associated with heat and extreme weather conditions climate change and the costs that may be associated with its impacts have the potential to affect nisource’s business in many ways including increasing the cost nisource incurs in providing its products and services impacting the demand for and consumption of its products and services due to change in both costs and weather patterns and affecting the economic health of the regions in which nisource operates

results of operations 

the following information should be read taking into account the critical accounting policies applied by nisource and discussed in “other information” of this item 7 

income from continuing operations and net income 

for the twelve months ended december 31 2009 nisource reported income from continuing operations of 2312 million or 084 per basic share compared to 3706 million or 135 per basic share in 2008 income from continuing operations for the twelve months ended december 31 2007 was 3030 million or 110 per basic share 

including results from discontinued operations nisource reported 2009 net income of 2177 million or 079 per basic share 2008 net income of 790 million or 029 per basic share and 2007 net income of 3214 million or 117 per basic share 

  item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

nisource inc 

comparability of line item operating results was impacted by regulatory and tax trackers that allow for the recovery in rates of certain costs such as bad debt expenses therefore increases in these tracked operating expenses are offset by increases in net revenues and had essentially no impact on income from continuing operations an increase in operating expenses of 163 million for the 2009 year was offset by a corresponding increase to net revenues reflecting recovery of these tracked costs in the 2008 period an increase in operating expenses of 175 million for trackers was offset by a corresponding increase to net revenues reflecting recovery of these costs these increases in 2009 and in 2008 were largely attributable to higher uncollectible accounts 

net revenues 

nisource analyzes the operating results using net revenues net revenues are calculated as revenues less the associated cost of sales excluding depreciation and amortization nisource believes net revenues is a better measure to analyze profitability than gross operating revenues since the majority of the cost of sales are tracked costs that are passed through directly to the customer resulting in an equal and offsetting amount reflected in gross operating revenues 

total consolidated net revenues for the twelve months ended december 31 2009 were 33314 million an 857 million increase compared with 2008 net revenues increased primarily due to increased gas distribution operations’ net revenues of 667 million and increased gas transmission and storage operations’ net revenues of 654 million partially offset by lower electric operations’ net revenues of 410 million gas distribution operations’ net revenues were higher due to increased revenues of 972 million from regulatory initiatives including impacts from rate proceedings partially offset by decreased residential and industrial customer usage of 220 million a 130 million decrease in offsystem sales and the impact of warmer weather of approximately 8 million within gas transmission and storage operations net revenues increased due to increases in firm capacity reservation fees of 295 million shorterterm transportation and storage services of 186 million and mineral rights leasing of 122 million the increase in firm capacity reservation fees was the result of growth projects such as the eastern market expansion the ohio storage expansion and new appalachian supply contracts electric operations’ net revenues decreased due to the impact of cooler weather of approximately 18 million lower industrial usage of 174 million which was significantly impacted by economic conditions lower capacity and energy sales into the pjm interconnection of 135 million 91 million of lower offsystem sales and 95 million lower emission allowance sales partially offset by increased residential and commercial usage of 124 million and lower nonrecoverable purchased power of 101 million the major steel company customers operated at full capacity for the first half of 2008 production decreased sharply in october 2008 bottoming near 50 in may 2009 since then nisource has seen growth in its power sales to these customers 

total consolidated net revenues for the twelve months ended december 31 2008 were 32457 million a 593 million increase compared with 2007 the increase in net revenues is from higher gas distribution operations net revenue which increased by 641 million this increase in net revenues was due primarily to regulatory and service programs including impacts from rate proceedings at columbia of pennsylvania columbia of ohio columbia of kentucky and bay state of 219 million increased trackers of 175 million offset in expense the impact of an adjustment for estimated unbilled revenues of 146 million recorded by northern indiana in 2007 and colder weather of approximately 9 million gas transmission and storage operations net revenues decreased 21 million mainly due to lower shorterterm transportation and storage services and commodity margin revenues of 240 million and the impact of a regulatory settlement of 90 million partially offset by increased subscriptions for firm transportation services of 231 million related to new interconnects along the columbia gulf pipeline system deliveries from the hardy storage field and incremental demand revenues on the columbia transmission system electric operations net revenues decreased 57 million from 2007 a result of lower residential sales volumes and lower residential and commercial margins of 195 million lower wholesale transactions of 141 million the impact of cooler weather of approximately 12 million and 114 million of higher miso related costs partially offset by the impact of a 335 million settlement in third quarter of 2007 related to the cost of power purchased by northern indiana in 2006 and 2007 and the impact of a 109 million adjustment for estimated unbilled electric revenues recorded in 2007 other operations net revenues were essentially flat compared with 2007

expenses 

operating expenses were 25455 million in 2009 an increase of 2062 million from the comparable 2008 period this increase was mainly due to higher employee and administrative expenses of 1023 million which primarily resulted from higher pension expense of 848 million net of deferring 107 million of pension costs under the regulatory order that was granted to columbia of ohio in july 2009 and higher payroll and benefits expense of 296 million operating expenses also increased as a result of restructuring charges of 272 million impairment charges of 228 million in 2009 higher depreciation of 220 million 216 million in increased legal reserves and increased trackers of 163 million offset in net revenues the increase in benefits expense is due in part to a 127 million adjustment that decreased expense in the third quarter of 2008 which resulted from the misclassification of certain claims in 2007 

operating expenses were 23393 million in 2008 an increase of 601 million from the comparable 2007 period this increase was primarily due to higher employee and administrative expenses of 375 million a 270 million increase in depreciation which includes an 83 million depreciation expense adjustment recorded by northern indiana during the second quarter of 2008 and 66 million of depreciation for the new sugar creek plant higher electric generation and maintenance expenses of 116 million and higher gross receipts and other taxes of 92 million these increases in expense were partially offset by an adjustment decreasing employee benefits expense by 127 million and lower legal reserves of 107 million the 127 million adjustment decreasing employee benefit expenses was due to a misclassification in 2007 of certain medical claims this adjustment had no impact on actual medical claims paid or coverage to benefit participants the higher generation and maintenance expenses were primarily attributable to planned turbine and boiler maintenance and a generator overhaul as well as 41 million in incremental costs associated with the sugar creek facility 

equity earnings in unconsolidated affiliates 

equity earnings in unconsolidated affiliates were 160 million in 2009 an increase of 37 million over 2008 equity earnings in unconsolidated affiliates includes investments in millennium and hardy storage which are integral to the gas transmission and storage operations business equity earnings from millennium which was placed into service on december 22 2008 totaled 121 million for 2009 net of an 81 million reduction resulting from interest rate hedges relating to millennium’s decision to delay permanent financing until 2010 

equity earnings in unconsolidated affiliates were 123 million in 2008 compared to 94 million in 2007 equity earnings increased 29 million due to higher afudc earnings from millennium partially offset by increased interest expense from hardy storage 

other income deductions 

other income deductions in 2009 reduced income 4049 million compared to a reduction of 3621 million in 2008 interest expense increased by 193 million primarily due to incremental interest expense associated with the issuance of 700 million of longterm debt in may 2008 the issuance of 600 million of longterm debt in march 2009 and a 385 million twoyear term loan entered into in april 2009 partially offset by the open market repurchase of 100 million of longterm debt in january 2009 the 2506 million tender offer repurchase of longterm debt in april 2009 and lower shortterm interest rates other net was a loss of 14 million compared to income of 176 million for 2008 primarily due to the sale of an investment in 2008 at a gain and lower interest income in 2009 on august 27 2008 nisource development company sold its interest in jof transportation company to lehigh service corporation for a pretax gain of 167 million jof transportation company held a 40 interest in chicago south shore  south bend railroad co and a 40 interest in indiana illinois development company llc 

other income deductions in 2008 reduced income 3621 million compared to a reduction of 4490 million in 2007 this decrease in other deductions of 869 million was mainly due to lower interest expense higher other income and a redemption premium of 406 million which reduced income in 2007 related to the early extinguishment of longterm notes for whiting clean energy interest expense net was 3797 million for 2008 compared to 4019 million for 2007 this decrease of 222 million was mainly due to lower shortterm interest rates and credit facility fees and the retirement late in 2007 of high cost debt associated with the whiting clean energy facility other net was income of 176 million for 2008 compared to a loss of 65 million for the comparable 2007 period due to the sale of an investment at a gain and lower costs associated with the sale of

nisource inc 

accounts receivable on august 27 2008 nisource development company sold its interest in jof transportation company to lehigh service corporation for a pretax gain of 167 million the other deduction in 2007 was due to a redemption premium of 406 million related to the early extinguishment of longterm notes for whiting clean energy 

income taxes 

the effective income tax rates were 418 334 and 352 in 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively the 84 increase in the overall effective tax rate in 2009 versus 2008 was the result of certain nondeductible expenses which increased tax expense 53 million additional deferred income tax expense of 97 million related primarily to state income tax apportionment changes and a reduction in afudcequity that increased tax expense by 32 million in addition the effective tax rate for 2008 was reduced by 149 million for the change in massachusetts state taxes discussed below the 18 decrease in the overall effective tax rate in 2008 versus 2007 was primarily the result of the change in massachusetts state taxes 

during the third quarter of 2009 nisource received permission from the irs to change its tax method of capitalizing certain costs which it applied on a prospective basis to the federal and state income tax returns filed for its 2008 tax year under the new tax accounting method nisource recorded federal and state income tax receivables of 2957 million in october 2009 2635 million of these refunds were received with additional refunds of 253 million received in december 2009 and january and february 2010 the balance of the refunds is expected to be received by the end of the second quarter of 2010 the loss for the 2008 tax year resulted in 12 million of additional federal income tax expense due to the elimination of section 199 deductions the impact of certain state restrictions on loss carrybacks and carryforwards resulted in a net charge to state income tax expense of 55 million 

during the third quarter of 2008 the governor of massachusetts signed into law a bill that significantly changed the massachusetts corporate income tax regime under the new law which became effective for tax years beginning on or after january 1 2009 nisource calculates its massachusetts income tax liability on a unitary basis meaning that the income tax obligation to the commonwealth of massachusetts is determined based on an apportioned share of all of nisource’s income rather than just the income of nisource’s subsidiaries doing business in massachusetts because of nisource’s substantial operations outside of massachusetts the new law had the impact of reducing the deferred income tax liability to massachusetts nisource recognized the impact of this tax law change as a 149 million reduction in income tax expense in 2008 income tax expense for 2009 reflects the impact of the new law on a prospective basis 

discontinued operations

the loss in 2009 includes activities associated with cer and other former subsidiaries where nisource has retained certain liabilities as well as for impairment charges associated with certain properties to be sold by ndc douglas properties 

the loss in 2008 is primarily attributable to an adjustment to the reserve for the tawney litigation and losses from businesses disposed during the year during 2008 nisource recorded an aftertax loss of 1082 million for the dispositions of northern utilities granite state gas and whiting clean energy in the first quarter of 2008 nisource began accounting for the operations of northern utilities granite state gas and whiting clean energy as discontinued operations as such net income of 44 million and 90 million was classified as discontinued operations for the years ended 2008 and 2007 respectively

for 2009 capital expenditures and certain other investing activities were 7986 million a decrease of 5080 million versus 2008 a significant amount of the decrease was due to lower capital expenditures within electric operations of 3898 million due to increased 2008 capital expenditures for the purchase of sugar creek

for 2010 the projected capital program and certain other investing activities are expected to be 9004 million which is 1018 million higher than the 2009 capital program this increased spending is mainly due to higher expenditures for the infrastructure replacement programs in the gas distribution segment and increased maintenance expenditures in the electric operations segment the program is expected to be funded through a combination of cash flow from operations and short term debt

commodity price risk 

nisource is exposed to commodity price risk as a result of its subsidiaries’ operations involving natural gas and power to manage this market risk nisource’s subsidiaries use derivatives including commodity futures contracts swaps and options nisource is not involved in speculative energy trading activity 

commodity price risk resulting from derivative activities at nisource’s rateregulated subsidiaries is limited since regulations allow recovery of prudently incurred purchased power fuel and gas costs through the ratemaking process including gains or losses on these derivative instruments if states should explore additional regulatory reform these subsidiaries may begin providing services without the benefit of the traditional ratemaking process and may be more exposed to commodity price risk some of nisource’s rateregulated utility subsidiaries offer commodity price risk products to its customers for which derivatives are used to hedge forecasted customer usage under such products these subsidiaries do not have regulatory recovery orders for these products and are subject to gains and losses recognized in earnings due to hedge ineffectiveness

interest rate risk 

nisource is exposed to interest rate risk as a result of changes in interest rates on borrowings under revolving credit agreements and floating rate notes which have interest rates that are indexed to shortterm market interest rates nisource is also exposed to interest rate risk due to changes in interest rates on fixedtovariable interest rate swaps that hedge the fair value of longterm debt based upon average borrowings and debt obligations subject to fluctuations in shortterm market interest rates an increase or decrease in shortterm interest rates of 100 basis points 1 would have increased or decreased interest expense by 192 million and 250 million for the years 2009 and 2008 respectively 

contemporaneously with the pricing of the 525 and 545 notes issued september 16 2005 nisource finance settled 900 million of forward starting interest rate swap agreements with six counterparties nisource paid an aggregate settlement payment of 355 million which is being amortized as an increase to interest expense over the term of the underlying debt resulting in an effective interest rate of 567 and 588 respectively 

nisource has entered into interest rate swap agreements to modify the interest rate characteristics of its outstanding longterm debt from fixed to variable on may 12 2004 nisource finance entered into fixedtovariable interest rate swap agreements in a notional amount of 660 million with six counterparties having a 6 12year term nisource finance will receive payments based upon a fixed 7875 interest rate and pay a floating interest amount based on us 6month bba libor plus an average of 308 per annum on september 15 2008 nisource finance terminated a fixedtovariable interest rate swap agreement with lehman brothers having a notional amount of 110 million

as a result of these fixedtovariable interest rate swap transactions 1050 million of nisource finance’s existing longterm debt is now subject to fluctuations in interest rates 

credit risk 

due to the nature of the industry credit risk is embedded in many of nisource’s business activities nisource’s extension of credit is governed by a corporate credit risk policy in addition risk management committee guidelines are in place which document management approval levels for credit limits evaluation of creditworthiness and credit risk mitigation efforts exposures to credit risks are monitored by the corporate credit risk function which is independent of commercial operations credit risk arises due to the possibility that a customer supplier or counterparty will not be able or willing to fulfill its obligations on a transaction on or before the settlement date for derivative related contracts credit risk arises when counterparties are obligated to deliver or purchase defined commodity units of gas or power to nisource at a future date per execution of contractual terms and conditions exposure to credit risk is measured in terms of both current obligations and the market value of forward positions net of any posted collateral such as cash letters of credit and qualified guarantees of support 

as a result of the ongoing credit crisis in the financial markets nisource has been closely monitoring the financial status of its banking credit providers and interest rate swap counterparties nisource continues to evaluate the financial status of its banking partners through the use of marketbased metrics such as credit default swap pricing levels and also through traditional credit ratings provided by the major credit rating agencies 

the parent company of one of nisource’s interest rate swap counterparties lehman brothers holdings inc filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on september 14 2008 which constituted an event of default under the swap agreement between nisource finance and lehman brothers special financing inc as a result on september 15 2008 nisource finance terminated the fixedtovariable interest rate swap agreement with lehman brothers having a notional value of 110 million the marktomarket closeout value of this swap at the september 15 2008 termination date was determined to be 48 million and was fully reserved in the third quarter of 2008

nisource measures certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value the level of the fair value hierarchy disclosed is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement nisource’s financial assets and liabilities include price risk assets and liabilities availableforsale securities and a deferred compensation plan obligation 

exchangetraded derivative contracts are generally based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets and are classified within level 1 these financial assets and liabilities are secured with cash on deposit with the exchange therefore nonperformance risk has not been incorporated into these valuations certain nonexchangetraded derivatives are valued using broker or overthecounter online exchanges in such cases these nonexchangetraded derivatives are classified within level 2 nonexchangebased derivative instruments include swaps forwards and options in certain instances these instruments may utilize models to measure fair value nisource uses a similar model to value similar instruments valuation models utilize various inputs that include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active other observable inputs for the asset or liability and marketcorroborated inputs ie inputs derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means where observable inputs are available for substantially the full term of the asset or liability the instrument is categorized in level 2 certain derivatives trade in less active markets with a lower availability of pricing information and models may be utilized in the valuation when such inputs have a significant impact on the measurement of fair value the instrument is categorized in level 3 credit risk is considered in the fair value calculation of derivative instruments that are not exchangetraded credit exposures are adjusted to reflect collateral agreements which reduce exposures 

price risk management assets also include fixedtofloating interestrate swaps which are designated as fair value hedges as a means to achieve its targeted level of variablerate debt as a percent of total debt nisource uses a calculation of future cash inflows and estimated future outflows related to the swap agreements which are discounted and netted to determine the current fair value additional inputs to the present value calculation include the contract terms as well as market parameters such as current and projected interest rates and volatility as they are based on observable data and valuations of similar instruments the interestrate swaps are categorized in level 2 in the fair value hierarchy credit risk is considered in the fair value calculation of the interest rate swap

market risk measurement 

market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices rates indices volatilities correlations or other market factors such as liquidity will result in losses for a specified position or portfolio nisource calculates a oneday var at a 95 confidence level for the gas marketing group that utilizes a variancecovariance methodology the daily market exposure for the gas marketing portfolio on an average high and low basis was 02 million 05 million and zero during 2009 respectively prospectively management has set the var limit at 08 million for gas marketing exceeding this limit would result in management actions to reduce portfolio risk

other information 

critical accounting policies 

nisource applies certain accounting policies based on the accounting requirements discussed below that have had and may continue to have significant impacts on nisource’s results of operations and consolidated balance sheets 

  item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

nisource inc 

basis of accounting for rateregulated subsidiaries asc topic 980 — regulated operations provides that rateregulated subsidiaries account for and report assets and liabilities consistent with the economic effect of the way in which regulators establish rates if the rates established are designed to recover the costs of providing the regulated service and if the competitive environment makes it probable that such rates can be charged and collected certain expenses and credits subject to utility regulation or rate determination normally reflected in income are deferred on the consolidated balance sheets and are recognized in income as the related amounts are included in service rates and recovered from or refunded to customers the total amounts of regulatory assets and liabilities reflected on the consolidated balance sheets were 18824 million and 16026 million at december 31 2009 and 19553 million and 14265 million at december 31 2008 respectively for additional information refer to note 8 “regulatory matters” in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

in the event that regulation significantly changes the opportunity for nisource to recover its costs in the future all or a portion of nisource’s regulated operations may no longer meet the criteria for the application of asc topic 980 — regulated operations in such event a writedown of all or a portion of nisource’s existing regulatory assets and liabilities could result if transition cost recovery is approved by the appropriate regulatory bodies that would meet the requirements under generally accepted accounting principles for continued accounting as regulatory assets and liabilities during such recovery period the regulatory assets and liabilities would be reported at the recoverable amounts if unable to continue to apply the provisions of asc topic 980 — regulated operations nisource would be required to apply the provisions of asc topic 98020 — discontinuation of rateregulated accounting in management’s opinion nisource’s regulated subsidiaries will be subject to asc topic 980 — regulated operations for the foreseeable future 

certain of the regulatory assets reflected on nisource’s consolidated balance sheets require specific regulatory action in order to be included in future service rates although recovery of these amounts is not guaranteed nisource believes that these costs meet the requirements for deferral as regulatory assets regulatory assets requiring specific regulatory action amounted to 3014 million at december 31 2009 if nisource determined that the amounts included as regulatory assets were not recoverable a charge to income would immediately be required to the extent of the unrecoverable amounts 

accounting for risk management activities under asc topic 815 — derivatives and hedging the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and resulting designation unrealized and realized gains and losses are recognized each period as components of accumulated other comprehensive income loss earnings or regulatory assets and liabilities depending on the nature of such derivatives for subsidiaries that utilize derivatives for cash flow hedges the effective portions of the gains and losses are recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income loss and are recognized in earnings concurrent with the disposition of the hedged risks for fair value hedges the gains and losses are recorded in earnings each period along with the change in the fair value of the hedged item as a result of the ratemaking process the rateregulated subsidiaries generally record gains and losses as regulatory liabilities or assets and recognize such gains or losses in earnings when both the contracts settle and the physical commodity flows these gains and losses recognized in earnings are then subsequently recovered or passed back in revenues through rates 

in order for a derivative contract to be designated as a hedge the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item or transaction must be highly effective the effectiveness test is performed at the inception of the hedge and each reporting period thereafter throughout the period that the hedge is designated any amounts determined to be ineffective are recorded currently in earnings 

although nisource applies some judgment in the assessment of hedge effectiveness to designate certain derivatives as hedges the nature of the contracts used to hedge the underlying risks is such that there is a high correlation of the changes in fair values of the derivatives and the underlying risks nisource generally uses nymex exchangetraded natural gas futures and options contracts and overthecounter swaps based on published indices to hedge the risks underlying its naturalgasrelated businesses nisource had 4109 million and 3511 million of price risk management assets of which 682 million and 3442 million related to hedges at december 31 2009 and 2008 respectively and 3603 million and 4750 million of price risk management liabilities of which 15 million and 4050 million related to hedges at december 31 2009 and 2008 respectively the amount of unrealized gains losses recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income loss net of taxes was zero and a loss of 03 million at december 31 2009 and 2008 respectively

pensions and postretirement benefits nisource has defined benefit plans for both pensions and other postretirement benefits the calculation of the net obligations and annual expense related to the plans requires a significant degree of judgment regarding the discount rates to be used in bringing the liabilities to present value longterm returns on plan assets and employee longevity among other assumptions due to the size of the plans and the longterm nature of the associated liabilities changes in the assumptions used in the actuarial estimates could have material impacts on the measurement of the net obligations and annual expense recognition for further discussion of nisource’s pensions and other postretirement benefits see note 12 “pension and other postretirement benefits” in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

goodwill nisource’s goodwill assets at december 31 2009 were 36773 million most of which resulted from the acquisition of columbia on november 1 2000 the goodwill balance also includes 133 million for northern indiana fuel and light and 55 million for kokomo gas as required nisource tests for impairment of goodwill on an annual basis and on an interim basis when events or circumstances indicate that a potential impairment may exist nisource’s annual goodwill test takes place in the second quarter of each year and was most recently finalized as of june 30 2009 the goodwill test utilized both an income approach and a market approach in performing the goodwill test nisource made certain required key assumptions such as longterm growth rates discount rates and fair market values 

these key assumptions required significant judgment by management which are subjective and forwardlooking in nature to assist in making these judgments nisource utilized thirdparty valuation specialists in both determining and testing key assumptions used in the analysis nisource based its assumptions on projected financial information that it believes is reasonable however actual results may differ materially from those projections for example with regard to nisource’s discount rate assumptions used in the june 30 2009 test results a 1 change in the discount rate would change the fair value of the columbia distribution operations and columbia transmission operations reporting units by approximately 10 billion and 800 million respectively 

although there was no goodwill asset impairment as of june 30 2009 an interim impairment test could be triggered by the following actual earnings results that are materially lower than expected significant adverse changes in the operating environment an increase in the discount rate changes in other key assumptions which require judgment and are forward looking in nature or if nisource’s market capitalization continues to stay below book value for an extended period of time no impairment triggers were identified in the fourth quarter of 2009 

refer to notes 1j and 6 “goodwill and other intangible assets” in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 

longlived asset impairment testing  nisource’s consolidated balance sheets contain longlived assets other than goodwill and intangible assets which are not subject to recovery under asc topic 980 — regulated operations as a result nisource assesses the carrying amount and potential earnings of these assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value could be impaired when an asset’s carrying value exceeds the undiscounted estimated future cash flows associated with the asset the asset is considered to be impaired to the extent that the asset’s fair value is less than its carrying value refer to note 1k “longlived assets” and note 3 “impairments restructuring and other charges” in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 

contingencies a contingent liability is recognized when it is probable that an environmental tax legal or other liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can reasonably be estimated accounting for contingencies require significant management judgment regarding the estimated probabilities and ranges of exposure to a potential liability estimates of the loss and associated probability are made based on the current facts available including present laws and regulations management’s assessment of the contingent liability could change as a result of future events or as more information becomes available actual amounts could differ from estimates and can have a material impact on nisource’s results of operations and financial position refer to note 20 “other commitments and contingencies” in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 

asset retirement obligations entities are required to record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred in the absence of quoted market prices fair value of asset retirement obligations are estimated using present value techniques using various assumptions including estimates of the

amounts and timing of future cash flows associated with retirement activities inflation rates and creditadjusted risk free rates when the liability is initially recorded the entity capitalizes the cost thereby increasing the carrying amount of the related longlived asset over time the liability is accreted and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset the rateregulated subsidiaries defer the difference between the amounts recognized for depreciation and accretion and the amount collected or expected to be collected in rates refer to note 7 “asset retirement obligations” in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 

revenue revenue is recorded as products and services are delivered utility revenues are billed to customers monthly on a cycle basis revenues are recorded on the accrual basis and include estimates for electricity and gas delivered but not billed cash received in advance from sales of commodities to be delivered in the future is recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as income upon delivery of the commodities 

taxes deferred income taxes are recognized for all temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities at currently enacted income tax rates 

additional deferred income tax assets and liabilities are required for temporary differences where regulators prohibit deferred income tax treatment for ratemaking purposes regulatory assets or liabilities corresponding to such additional deferred tax assets or liabilities may be recorded to the extent recoverable from or payable to customers through the ratemaking process amounts applicable to income taxes due from and due to customers primarily represent differences between the book and tax basis of net utility plant in service 

recently adopted accounting pronouncements 

fair value measurements and disclosures in september 2006 the fasb amended guidance to define fair value establish a framework for measuring fair value and to expand disclosures about fair value measurements fair value refers to the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants in the market in which the reporting entity transacts fair value should be based on the assumptions market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability the adoption of the amended fair value measurements and disclosures on january 1 2008 did not have an impact on nisource’s balance of retained earnings 

in february 2008 the fasb delayed the effective date of fair value measurement and disclosure guidance for all nonrecurring fair value measurements of nonfinancial assets and liabilities until fiscal years beginning after november 15 2008 the delayed guidance became effective for all nonrecurring nonfinancial assets and liabilities as of january 1 2009 

in october 2008 the fasb clarified the application of the guidance in a market that is not active and provides an example to illustrate key considerations in determining the fair value of a financial asset when the market for that financial asset is not active the clarification was effective upon issuance including prior periods for which financial statements had not been issued 

in april 2009 the fasb provided additional guidance for estimating fair value when the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability have significantly decreased the additional guidance was effective for interim reporting periods ending after june 15 2009 with early adoption permitted nisource adopted the additional guidance on april 1 2009 

in august 2009 the fasb issued authoritative guidance clarifying the measurement of the fair value of a liability in circumstances when a quoted price in an active market for an identical liability is not available the guidance emphasizes that entities should maximize the use of observable inputs in the absence of quoted prices when measuring the fair value of liabilities this guidance became effective on october 1 2009 

in september 2009 the fasb issued authoritative guidance that provides further clarification for measuring the fair value of investments in entities that meet the fasb’s definition of an investment company this guidance permits a company to estimate the fair value of an investment using the net asset value per share of the investment if the net

nisource inc 

asset value is determined in accordance with the fasb’s guidance for investment companies as of the company’s measurement date this creates a practical expedient to determining a fair value estimate and certain attributes of the investment such as redemption restrictions will not be considered in measuring fair value additionally companies with investments within the scope of this guidance must disclose additional information related to the nature and risks of the investments this guidance is effective as of december 31 2009 and is required to be applied prospectively nisource has alternative investments that are within the scope of this guidance however the fair value of the alternative investments are already determined based on the net asset values per fund the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements 

refer to note 18 “fair value disclosures” in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 

fair value of financial instruments in april 2009 the fasb revised authoritative guidance requiring disclosures about fair value of financial instruments of publicly traded companies as well as annual financial statements the guidance was effective for interim reporting periods ending after june 15 2009 with early adoption permitted nisource adopted the guidance on april 1 2009 as the guidance provides only disclosure requirements the application of this asc topic did not impact the consolidated financial statements refer to note 18 “fair value disclosures” in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 

business combinations in december 2007 the fasb amended authoritative guidance to improve the relevance representational faithfulness and comparability of information that a reporting entity provides in its financial reports regarding business combinations and its effects including recognition of assets and liabilities the measurement of goodwill and required disclosures this guidance was effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years beginning on or after december 15 2008 and earlier adoption was prohibited the adoption of the amendment on january 1 2009 did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements 

in april 2009 the fasb addressed application issues on initial recognition and measurement subsequent measurement and accounting and disclosure of assets and liabilities arising from contingencies in a business combination the additional guidance was effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years beginning on or after december 15 2008 

recently issued accounting pronouncements 

consolidation of variable interest entities in june 2009 the fasb issued authoritative guidance to amend the manner in which entities evaluate whether consolidation is required for vies the model for determining which enterprise has a controlling financial interest and is the primary beneficiary of a vie has changed significantly under the new guidance previously variable interest holders had to determine whether they had a controlling financial interest in a vie based on a quantitative analysis of the expected gains andor losses of the entity in contrast the new guidance requires an enterprise with a variable interest in a vie to qualitatively assess whether it has a controlling financial interest in the entity and if so whether it is the primary beneficiary furthermore this guidance requires that companies continually evaluate vies for consolidation rather than assessing based upon the occurrence of triggering events this revised guidance also requires enhanced disclosures about how a company’s involvement with a vie affects its financial statements and exposure to risks this guidance is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years beginning on the first fiscal year that begins after november 15 2009 with early adoption prohibited nisource is currently reviewing the additional requirements to determine the impact on the consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements 

transfer of financial assets in june 2009 the fasb issued authoritative guidance to amend derecognition criteria guidance in asc 860 to improve the relevance representational faithfulness and comparability of the information that a reporting entity provides in its financial statements about a transfer of financial assets the effects of a transfer on its financial position financial performance and cash flows and a transferor’s continuing involvement if any in transferred financial assets this guidance is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years beginning on the first fiscal year that begins after november 15 2009 with early adoption prohibited nisource has reviewed the accounting and additional disclosure requirements to determine the impact on the consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements this statement will

international financial reporting standards 

on november 14 2008 the sec issued a proposed ifrs “roadmap” which outlines several milestones that need to be addressed prior to making the adoption to ifrs mandatory by us filers in 2011 the sec will determine whether to require mandatory adoption of ifrs for all us issuers according to recent announcements large accelerated filers including nisource may be required to file ifrs financial statements in 2015 

the proposed accounting changes are complex and comprehensive and will involve converting technical accounting and financial reporting to ifrs in addition converting to ifrs will involve changes to processes and controls regulatory and management reporting information technology tax treasury legal human resources and contractual issues nisource will implement a project plan to analyze the requirements of ifrs and the potential impact adoption would have on the consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements 

environmental matters 

nisource is subject to regulation by various federal state and local authorities in the areas of air quality water quality control of toxic substances and hazardous and solid wastes and other environmental matters nisource believes that it is in substantial compliance with those environmental regulations currently applicable to nisource’s business and operations refer to note 20d “environmental matters” in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding environmental matters

results and discussion of segment operations 

presentation of segment information 

operating segments are components of an enterprise for which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance the nisource chief executive officer is the chief operating decision maker 

nisource’s operations are divided into four primary business segments the gas distribution operations segment provides natural gas service and transportation for residential commercial and industrial customers in ohio pennsylvania virginia kentucky maryland indiana and massachusetts the gas transmission and storage operations segment offers gas transportation and storage services for ldcs marketers and industrial and commercial customers located in northeastern midatlantic midwestern and southern states and the district of columbia the electric operations segment provides electric service in 20 counties in the northern part of indiana the other operations segment primarily includes gas and power marketing and ventures focused on distributed power generation technologies including cogeneration facilities fuel cells and storage systems

competition 

gas distribution operations competes with investorowned municipal and cooperative electric utilities throughout its service area and to a lesser extent with other regulated natural gas utilities and propane and fuel oil suppliers gas distribution operations continues to be a strong competitor in the energy market as a result of strong customer preference for natural gas competition with providers of electricity is generally strongest in the residential and commercial markets of kentucky southern ohio central pennsylvania and western virginia where electric rates are primarily driven by lowcost coalfired generation in ohio and pennsylvania similar gas provider competition is also common gas competes with fuel oil and propane in the massachusetts market mainly due to the installed base of fuel oil and propanebased heating which over time has comprised a declining percentage of the overall market 

market conditions 

for 2009 gas distribution operations gross revenues decreased due to a significant decline in natural gas commodity prices spot prices for the winter of 20092010 have primarily been in the 300 — 650 dth range compared to prices in the 535 — 710 dth range experienced during the winter of 20082009 this decline can be attributed to the weakening demand that occurred earlier in 2009 partially offset by a slight decline in production that occurred throughout 2009 

entering the 20092010 winter season storage levels were 373 bcf and 243 bcf ahead of the prior year and 5 year average inventory levels respectively during the summer of 2009 prices ranged between 200 and 500dth which were substantially less than those prices experienced in the summer of 2008 this can be attributed to the continued weak demand that began in late 2008 

all nisource gas distribution operations companies have stateapproved recovery mechanisms that provide a means for full recovery of prudently incurred gas costs gas costs are treated as passthrough costs and have no impact on the net revenues recorded in the period the gas costs included in revenues are matched with the gas cost expense recorded in the period and the difference is recorded on the consolidated balance sheets as underrecovered or overrecovered gas cost to be included in future customer billings 

the gas distribution operations companies have pursued nontraditional revenue sources within the evolving natural gas marketplace these efforts include the sale of products and services upstream of the companies’ service territory the sale of products and services in the companies’ service territories and gas supply cost incentive mechanisms for service to their core markets the upstream products are made up of transactions that occur between an individual gas distribution operations company and a buyer for the sales of unbundled or rebundled gas supply and capacity the onsystem services are offered by nisource to customers and include products such as the transportation and balancing of gas on the gas distribution operations company system the incentive mechanisms give the gas distribution operations companies an opportunity to share in the savings created from such things as gas purchase prices paid below an agreed upon benchmark and its ability to reduce pipeline capacity charges the treatment of the revenues generated from these types of transactions vary by operating company with some sharing the benefits with customers and others using these revenues to mitigate transition costs occurring as the result of customer choice programs gas distribution operations continues to offer choice opportunities where customers can choose to purchase gas from a third party supplier through regulatory initiatives in all of its jurisdictions 

capital expenditures and other investing activities 

the table below reflects actual capital expenditures and other investing activities by category for 2008 and 2009 and estimates for 2010 

 

the gas distribution operations segment’s capital expenditures and other investing activities were 3432 million in 2009 and are projected to be approximately 3917 million in 2010 capital expenditures for 2009 were lower than 2008 by approximately 265 million primarily due to decreased spending on maintenance projects the increase in

cost recovery and trackers a significant portion of the distribution companies’ revenue is related to the recovery of gas costs the review and recovery of which occurs via standard regulatory proceedings all states require periodic review of actual gas procurement activity to determine prudence and to permit the recovery of prudently incurred costs related to the supply of gas for customers nisource distribution companies have historically been found prudent in the procurement of gas supplies to serve customers 

certain operating costs of the nisource distribution companies are significant recurring in nature and generally outside the control of the distribution companies some states allow the recovery of such costs via cost tracking mechanisms such tracking mechanisms allow for abbreviated regulatory proceedings in order for the distribution companies to implement charges and recover appropriate costs tracking mechanisms allow for more timely recovery of such costs as compared with more traditional cost recovery mechanisms examples of such mechanisms include gcr adjustment mechanisms tax riders and bad debt recovery mechanisms 

comparability of gas distribution operations line item operating results is impacted by these regulatory trackers that allow for the recovery in rates of certain costs such as bad debt expenses increases in the expenses that are the subject of trackers result in a corresponding increase in net revenues and therefore have essentially no impact on total operating income results 

certain of the nisource distribution companies have completed rate proceedings involving infrastructure replacement or are embarking upon regulatory initiatives to replace significant portions of their operating systems that are nearing the end of their useful lives each ldc’s approach to cost recovery may be unique given the different laws regulations and precedent that exist in each jurisdiction on february 27 2009 columbia of ohio filed an application to adjust its rider irp to recover costs for risers and accelerated main replacements on june 24 2009 the puco approved a stipulation allowing columbia of ohio to implement the new rider rate on july 1 2009 resulting in an annual revenue increase of 142 million on october 26 2009 the kentucky psc approved a mechanism for recovering the costs of columbia of kentucky’s accelerated main replacement program in the same order the kentucky psc also approved a mechanism for the recovery of columbia of kentucky’s uncollectible expenses associated with the cost of gas on october 30 2009 the massachusetts dpu approved a mechanism for the recovery of costs associated with the replacement of bay state’s infrastructure 

on april 30 2009 columbia of ohio filed an application with the puco to defer pension and other postretirement benefits expenses above those currently subject to collection in rates effective january 1 2009 on july 8 2009 the puco issued an order approving columbia of ohio’s application although the deferred balances will not accrue carrying charges and columbia of ohio may not seek recovery of pension and other postretirement benefits deferrals in a base rate proceeding for a period of five years the amount deferred was approximately 13 million in 2009 

customer usage the nisource distribution companies have experienced declining usage by customers due in large part to the sensitivity of sales to volatility in commodity prices as well as general economic conditions a significant portion of the ldcs’ operating costs are fixed in nature historically rate design at the distribution level has been structured such that a large portion of cost recovery is based upon throughput rather than in a fixed charge during times of unusually high gas prices throughput and net revenue have been adversely affected as customers may reduce their usage as a result of higher gas cost or other economic conditions columbia of ohio recently restructured its rate design through a base rate proceeding and has adopted a “decoupled” rate design which more closely links the recovery of fixed costs with fixed charges in regulatory proceedings in 2009 bay state and columbia of virginia received approval of decoupling mechanisms which adjust revenues to an approved benchmark level through a volumetric adjustment factor each of the states in which the nisource ldcs operate have different requirements regarding the procedure for establishing such changes and nisource is seeking similar changes through regulatory proceedings for its other gas distribution utilities

environmental matters 

currently various environmental matters impact the gas distribution operations segment as of december 31 2009 reserves have been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions refer to note 20d “environmental matters” in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the gas distribution operations segment 

restructuring 

in september 2009 nisource announced the restructuring of northern indiana which aims to redefine business and operations strategies and achieve cost reductions during 2009 nisource recorded a pretax restructuring charge related to this initiative net of adjustments of 54 million to “operation and maintenance” expense on the statement of consolidated income which primarily includes costs related to severance and other employee related costs for approximately 43 employees and outside services costs of the 54 million restructuring charge net of adjustments approximately 17 million was recorded to gas distribution operations refer to note 3 “impairments restructuring and other charges” in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding restructuring initiatives 

sale of northern utilities 

on december 1 2008 nisource completed its sale of northern utilities and granite state gas to unitil corporation the final sale amount was 2091 million which included 491 million in working capital northern utilities is a local gas distribution company serving 52 thousand customers in 44 communities in maine and new hampshire in the first quarter of 2008 nisource began accounting for the operations of northern utilities as discontinued operations as such a net loss of 05 million and net income of 62 million and 53 million from continuing operations for northern utilities which affected the gas distribution operations segment was classified as net income from discontinued operations for the years ended december 31 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively refer to note 4 “discontinued operations and assets and liabilities held for sale” in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 

nisource acquired northern utilities and granite state gas in 1999 as part of the company’s larger acquisition of bay state nisource is retaining its ownership of bay state as a core component of the company’s longterm investmentdriven growth strategy 

weather 

in general nisource calculates the weather related revenue variance based on changing customer demand driven by weather variance from normal heating degreedays normal is evaluated using heating degree days across the nisource distribution region while the temperature base for measuring heating degreedays ie the estimated average daily temperature at which heating load begins varies slightly across the region the nisource composite measurement is based on 65 degrees nisource composite heating degreedays reported do not directly correlate to the weather related dollar impact on the results of gas distribution operations heating degreedays experienced during different times of the year or in different operating locations may have more or less impact on volume and dollars depending on when and where they occur when the detailed results are combined for reporting there may be weather related dollar impacts on operations when there is not an apparent or significant change in the aggregated nisource composite heating degreeday comparison 

weather in the gas distribution operations service territories for 2009 approximated normal and was about 3 warmer than 2008 decreasing net revenues by approximately 8 million for the year ended december 31 2009 compared to 2008 

weather in the gas distribution operations service territories for 2008 was approximately 2 colder than normal and 5 colder than 2007 increasing net revenues by approximately 9 million for the year ended december 31 2008 compared to 2007 

throughput 

total volumes sold and transported for the year ended december 31 2009 were 8310 mmdth compared to 9232 mmdth for 2008 this decrease reflected lower sales to residential and industrial customers due to warmer weather

gas distribution operations continued 

and lower industrial usage due to the economy’s slowdown and lower offsystem sales volumes resulting primarily from market conditions during 2009 that presented fewer opportunities to sell gas to nontraditional customers 

total volumes sold and transported for the year ended december 31 2008 were 9232 mmdth compared to 9073 mmdth for 2007 this increase reflected higher sales to residential and commercial customers attributable mainly to cooler weather and higher offsystem sales 

net revenues 

net revenues for 2009 were 16094 million an increase of 667 million from 2008 this increase in net revenues was primarily due to regulatory and service programs including impacts from rate cases at various utilities of 972 million and increased trackers of 49 million offset in expense partially offset by decreased industrial and residential customer usage of 220 million lower offsystem sales revenues of 130 million and the impact of warmer weather of approximately 8 million 

net revenues for 2008 were 15427 million an increase of 641 million from 2007 this increase in net revenues was due primarily to regulatory and service programs including impacts from rate proceedings at columbia of pennsylvania columbia of ohio columbia of kentucky and bay state of 219 million the impact of an adjustment for estimated unbilled revenues of 146 million recorded by northern indiana in 2007 increased trackers of 131 million offset in expense colder weather of approximately 9 million and increased residential usage of 40 million partially offset by reduced industrial and commercial margins and usage of 90 million the 219 million increase from regulatory and service programs is inclusive of a 93 million decrease in net revenues associated with the implementation of the columbia of ohio stipulation entered into with the ohio consumers counsel and the puco at the end of 2007 

at northern indiana sales revenues and customer billings are adjusted for amounts related to under and overrecovered purchased gas costs from prior periods per regulatory order these amounts are primarily reflected in the “other” gross revenues statistic provided at the beginning of this segment discussion the adjustment to other gross revenues for the twelve months ended december 31 2009 and 2008 was a revenue decrease of 1211 million and 58 million respectively primarily due to the volatility in gas prices experienced over the past two years 

operating income 

for the twelve months ended december 31 2009 operating income for the gas distribution operations segment was 3278 million a decrease of 83 million compared to the same period in 2008 primarily attributable to higher operating expenses of 750 million partially offset by increased net revenues described above operating expenses increased due to higher employee and administrative costs of 446 million increased depreciation expense of 193 million higher uncollectible costs of 55 million increased net regulatory and tax trackers of 49 million that are offset in net revenues and increased maintenance costs of 36 million the increase in employee and administrative expense was primarily due to higher pension cost of 318 million net of the 107 million deferral of increased pension cost for columbia of ohio 

for the twelve months ended december 31 2008 operating income for the gas distribution operations segment was 3361 million an increase of 110 million compared to the same period in 2007 primarily attributable to increased net revenues described above partially offset by higher operating expenses of 531 million the increase in operating expenses includes 131 million of expenses recoverable through regulatory and tax trackers which are offset in revenues of which 66 million is for an increase in tracked tax expense operating expenses also increased primarily due to higher employee and administrative costs of 213 million increased maintenance and supplies expense of 53 million higher depreciation expense of 45 million and increased gross receipts and other operating taxes excluding the impact of trackers of 40 million employee and administrative costs increased as a result of higher payroll costs for increased headcount cost of living and performance adjustments and higher corporate services costs related to information technology and consulting

columbia penn project  in september 2008 columbia transmission announced its intention to develop additional natural gas transmission gathering and processing services along and around its existing pipeline corridor between waynesburg pa and renovo pa referred to as the “columbia penn” corridor this twophase development will provide access to pipeline capacity in conjunction with production increases in the marcellus shale formation which underlies columbia transmission’s transmission and storage network in the region phase i was placed into service in february 2009 and phase ii was placed into service in november 2009 

appalachian expansion project on august 22 2008 the ferc issued an order to columbia transmission which granted a certificate to construct the project the project included building a new 9470 hp compressor station in west virginia the appalachian expansion project added 100000 dth per day of transportation capacity and is fully subscribed on a 15year contracted firm basis construction is complete and the project was placed in service on july 1 2009 

eastern market expansion project on january 14 2008 the ferc issued an order which granted a certificate to construct the project the project allows columbia transmission to expand its facilities to provide additional storage and transportation services and to replace certain existing facilities the eastern market expansion added 97000 dth per day of storage and transportation deliverability and is fully subscribed on a 15year contracted firm basis construction of the facilities is complete and was placed in service april 1 2009 

ohio storage project on june 24 2008 columbia transmission filed an application before the ferc for approval to expand two of its ohio storage fields for additional capacity of nearly 7 bcf and 103400 dth per day of deliverability approval was granted in march 2009 and construction of the facilities began in april 2009 partial service related to this expansion was available beginning may 2009 and the expansion was placed in full service during the fourth quarter of 2009 the expansion capacity is 58 contracted on a longterm firm basis with the ferc authorized marketbased rates for these and any future services 

easton compressor station project on march 30 2009 columbia transmission announced a binding open season for capacity into premium east coast markets resulting from modifications made to the company’s easton compressor station the modifications increase delivery capacity from the wagoner interconnection point between the columbia transmission and millennium pipeline systems through the open season which closed on april 3 2009 columbia transmission received 30000 dth per day of binding bids construction began and was completed and service commenced in the fourth quarter of 2009 

growth projects in progress 

cobb compressor station project this project continues the gas transmission and storage operations segment strategy to meet producers’ nearterm incremental transportation demand in the appalachian basin shippers have also executed precedent agreements for a total of approximately 25500 dth per day of longterm firm transportation service associated with a facility expansion at cobb compressor station in kanawha county west virginia the cobb expansion is expected to be in service by may 2010 

majorsville pa project the gas transmission and storage operations segment is in the process of executing three separate projects totaling approximately 80 million in the majorsville pa vicinity to aggregate marcellus shale gas production for downstream transmission precedent agreements were executed by anchor shippers in the fourth quarter of 2009 on january 20 2010 columbia transmission filed with the ferc an application to transfer certain pipeline facilities to a newly formed affiliate nisource midstream llc that once approved will be part of the facilities providing nonferc jurisdiction gathering services to producers in the majorsville pa vicinity the majorsville pa project is expected to be in service by the end of the third quarter 2010

regulatory matters 

on november 9 2009 columbia gulf filed an application before the ferc for approval to replace columbia gulf’s existing transportation retainage adjustment tracker mechanism that columbia gulf currently relies upon to recover fuel with a proposed incentive fixed fuel mechanism the incentive fixed fuel would establish a fixed fuel rate and includes incentives to improve pipeline infrastructure and reduce pipeline fuel requirements 

capital expenditures and other investing activities 

the table below reflects actual capital expenditures and other investing activities by category for 2008 and 2009 and estimates for 2010 

 

capital expenditures in the gas transmission and storage operations segment in 2009 decreased by 964 million relative to 2008 primarily due to lower expenditures on growth projects expenditures related to maintenance projects were also lower during 2009 as well the capital expenditure program and other investing activities in 2010 are projected to be approximately 300 million which is an increase of 126 million over 2009 the increase in maintenance and other from 2009 to 2010 is attributable to integrity management pipeline spending and a planned pipeline replacement 

sales and percentage of physical capacity sold 

columbia transmission and columbia gulf compete for transportation customers based on the type of service a customer needs operating flexibility available capacity and price columbia gulf and columbia transmission provide a significant portion of total transportation services under firm contracts and derive a smaller portion of revenues through interruptible contracts with management seeking to maximize the portion of physical capacity sold under firm contracts 

firm service contracts require pipeline capacity to be reserved for a given customer between certain receipt and delivery points firm customers generally pay a “capacity reservation” fee based on the amount of capacity being reserved regardless of whether the capacity is used plus an incremental usage fee when the capacity is used annual capacity reservation revenues derived from firm service contracts generally remain constant over the life of the contract because the revenues are based upon capacity reserved and not whether the capacity is actually used the high percentage of revenue derived from capacity reservation fees mitigates the risk of revenue fluctuations within the gas transmission and storage operations segment due to changes in nearterm supply and demand conditions for the twelve months ended december 31 2009 approximately 893 of the transportation revenues were derived from capacity reservation fees paid under firm contracts and 38 of the transportation revenues were derived from usage fees under firm contracts this is compared to approximately 901 of the transportation revenues derived from capacity reservation fees paid under firm contracts and 53 of transportation revenues derived from usage fees under firm contracts for the twelve months ended december 31 2008 

interruptible transportation service includes park and loan services and is typically shortterm in nature and is generally used by customers that either do not need firm service or have been unable to contract for firm service these customers pay a usage fee only for the volume of gas actually transported the ability to provide this service is limited to available capacity not otherwise used by firm customers and customers receiving services under interruptible contracts are not assured capacity in the pipeline facilities gas transmission and storage operations provides interruptible service at competitive prices in order to capture short term market opportunities as they occur and interruptible service is viewed by management as an important strategy to optimize revenues from the gas transmission assets for the twelve months ended december 31 2009 and 2008 approximately 69 and 46 respectively of the transportation revenues were derived from interruptible contracts

hartsville and delhi compressor stations 

in february 2008 tornados struck columbia gulf’s hartsville compressor station in macon county tennessee immediately after the tornados struck columbia gulf began to construct both temporary and permanent facilities at hartsville in july 2008 the station completed the installation of temporary horsepower and restored capacity during the fourth quarter 2009 construction of a permanent compression solution was completed in early january 2010 testing was completed and permanent horsepower was placed into service this permanent compression solution is environmentally advantageous as it is more efficient cleanerburning and quieter replacement of the remaining temporary facilities which were constructed to restore system capabilities with a permanent solution is expected to be completed by the end of the first quarter of 2010 columbia gulf incurred 122 million and 470 million in 2009 and 2008 respectively in reconstruction costs columbia gulf expects to incur up to an additional 12 million in costs dependent upon facility abandonments for the compressor station and ancillary facilities damage claims were settled with insurance companies in 2008 

in december 2007 columbia gulf’s line 100 ruptured approximately two miles north of its delhi compressor station in louisiana on july 1 2008 columbia gulf restored full pressure and full capacity on the line 100 pipeline columbia gulf continues to operate under a corrective action order issued by the pipeline and hazardous materials safety administration in december 2007 costs of 29 million principally capital in nature to repair damages on line 100 were incurred predominantly in 2008 

insurance proceeds attributable to capital replacement related to the aforementioned incidents totaled 453 million and 314 million in 2009 and 2008 respectively as of december 31 2009 there are no claims outstanding for these incidents 

hurricanes 

in september 2004 hurricane ivan damaged certain columbia gulf property and in the third quarter of 2005 columbia gulf incurred additional damages to its pipeline assets and facilities as a result of hurricanes katrina and rita in 2009 columbia gulf incurred 26 million in capital costs to complete the repairs from hurricanes bringing the total costs recorded to repair damages to nearly 59 million over a multiyear period which were principally capital expenditures recovered through insurance costs to repair damages were recognized when costs were incurred or when information became available to estimate the damages incurred 

insurance claims related to hurricanes were settled in december 2008 for 408 million of which 115 million 168 million and 85 million in proceeds was received in 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively additional proceeds were collected prior to 2007 insurance proceeds covered capital replacement operation and maintenance losses and business interruption fuel costs and other losses as of december 31 2009 there are no claims outstanding for this incident

throughput 

columbia transmission provides transportation and storage services for ldcs and other customers within its market area which covers portions of northeastern midatlantic midwestern and southern states and the district of columbia billed throughput for columbia transmission consists of deliveries off of its system excluding gas delivered to storage for later delivery billed throughput for columbia gulf reflects transportation services for gas delivered through its mainline and laterals crossroads pipeline’s throughput comes from deliveries it makes to its customers and other pipelines that are located in northern indiana and ohio intersegment eliminations represent gas delivered to affiliated pipelines within the segment 

throughput for the gas transmission and storage operations segment totaled 13914 mmdth for 2009 compared to 14885 mmdth in 2008 the decrease of 971 mmdth is due primarily to lower columbia gulf deliveries partially offset by increased columbia transmission volumes transported from new columbia transmission contracts 

throughput for the gas transmission and storage operations segment totaled 14885 mmdth for 2008 compared to 16189 mmdth in 2007 the decrease of 1304 mmdth is due primarily to sale of most of columbia gulf’s offshore assets midyear partially offset by increased transportation deliveries on columbia transmission related to growth projects columbia gulf in tandem with columbia transmission renewed several key longterm contracts during 2008 

net revenues 

net revenues were 9307 million for 2009 an increase of 654 million from 2008 the increase in net revenues was primarily from increased firm capacity reservation fees of 295 million principally from growth projects such as the eastern market expansion and the ohio storage expansion as well as for new appalachian supply contracts increased shorterterm transportation and storage services of 186 million mineral rights leasing revenues of 122 million increased trackers of 92 million offset in operating expense and the impact of a regulatory settlement of 90 million that occurred in 2008 partially offset by the impact of 53 million of contract buyouts in 2008 

net revenues were 8653 million for 2008 a decrease of 21 million from 2007 the decrease in net revenues was mainly due to lower shorterterm transportation and storage services and commodity margin revenues of 240 million the impact of a regulatory settlement of 90 million and insurance proceeds from a business interruption claim that improved last year’s results by 26 million these decreases in net revenues were partially offset by increased subscriptions for firm transportation services of 231 million related to new interconnects along the columbia gulf pipeline system deliveries from the hardy storage field and incremental demand revenues on the columbia transmission system as well as from a 53 million impact from contract buyouts and a 44 million increase in trackers that are offset in expense

on july 24 2008 the iurc issued an order approving northern indiana’s proposed purchase power agreements with subsidiaries of iberdrola renewables for windgenerated power from iowa and south dakota under these agreements northern indiana purchases up to approximately 100 mw of wind power northern indiana began purchasing wind power in april 2009 although a state or federal renewable portfolio standard is not yet established northern indiana expects that its wind power purchase agreements would qualify as eligible purchases under any such standard 

market conditions 

northern indiana’s mwh sales to steelrelated industries accounted for approximately 626 and 636 of the total industrial mwh sales for the twelve months ended december 31 2009 and 2008 respectively northern indiana’s industrial sales volumes and revenues declined significantly in 2009 as compared to 2008 due to the dramatic changes in the world economy mid to late 2008 and throughout 2009 the us steel industry continues to adjust to changing market conditions predominant factors are the ongoing economic downturn industry consolidation fluctuating demand increased steelmaking capacity in china and india and gross margin volatility in the fourth quarter of 2008 the industry responded to decreased steel demand by idling capacity throughout the world and bottoming near 50 in may 2009 since then nisource has seen growth in its power sales to these customers 

capital expenditures and other investing activities 

the table below reflects actual capital expenditures and other investing activities by category for 2008 and 2009 and estimates for 2010 

 

the electric operations segment’s capital expenditure program and other investing activities in 2009 were lower by 3898 million versus 2008 the decrease in capital was primarily attributable to the acquisition of sugar creek in 2008 capital expenditures in the segment are projected to be approximately 2083 million in 2010 which is an increase of 457 million this increase is mainly due to increased maintenance projects in the generation fleet 

regulatory matters 

significant rate developments on june 27 2008 northern indiana filed a petition for new electric base rates and charges it has been more than 22 years since northern indiana has had an electric base rate increase the filing requested an increase in base rates calculated to produce additional gross margin of 857 million several stakeholder groups have intervened in the case representing customer groups and various counties and towns within northern indiana’s electric service territory evidentiary hearings concluded on august 6 2009 and the briefing schedule concluded in january 2010 the case is expected to be resolved with new electric rates effective during the first half of 2010 

northern indiana received a favorable regulatory order on february 18 2009 related to its actions to increase its electric generating capacity and advance its electric rate case acting on a settlement reached among northern indiana and its regulatory stakeholders the iurc ruled that northern indiana’s sugar creek electric generating plant was in service for ratemaking purposes as of december 1 2008 the iurc also approved the deferral of depreciation expenses and carrying costs associated with the 330 million sugar creek investment northern indiana purchased sugar creek on may 30 2008 and effective december 1 2008 sugar creek was accepted as an internal designated network resource within the miso 

northern indiana anticipates filing another electric base rate case during 2010 among other things the filing is expected to include the effect of increased pension expense as well as demand levels based on more recent operating experience

during 2002 northern indiana settled certain regulatory matters related to an electric rate review on september 23 2002 the iurc issued an order adopting most aspects of the settlement the order approving the settlement provides that certain electric customers of northern indiana will receive bill credits of approximately 551 million each year the credits will continue at approximately the same annual level and per the same methodology until the iurc enters a base rate order that approves revised northern indiana electric rates credits amounting to 561 million 539 million and 56 million were recognized for electric customers for 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively 

on december 9 2009 the iurc issued an order in its generic dsm investigation proceeding establishing an overall annual energy savings goal of 2 to be achieved by indiana jurisdictional electric utilities in 10 years with interim savings goals established in years one through nine northern indiana and other jurisdictional electric utilities must file dsm plans on july 1 2010 2013 2016 and 2019 with annual updates in the interim periods the iurc requires that certain core programs be established and administered by an independent third party the iurc did not make any specific findings with respect to cost recovery issues northern indiana is unable to determine or quantify the impact of the order at this time 

miso as part of northern indiana’s participation in the miso transmission service wholesale energy and ancillary service markets certain administrative fees and nonfuel costs have been incurred iurc orders have been issued authorizing the deferral for consideration in a future rate case proceeding of certain nonfuel related costs incurred after northern indiana’s rate moratorium which expired on july 31 2006 in its base rate case northern indiana proposes recovery of the cumulative amount of net nonfuel charges that were deferred as of december 31 2008 and to recover through a tracker charges deferred between december 31 2008 and the date of effective rates in this case as of december 31 2009 northern indiana has deferred 35 million of nonfuel charges pending the outcome of the current electric rate case proceeding 

on november 7 2008 the ferc issued an order clarifying the rsg first pass calculation and requiring the miso to resettle the rsg market using the correct calculation and to pay refunds or assess surcharges to market participants as appropriate to correct a misinterpretation of an order issued by ferc in april 2006 northern indiana believes that it would have been entitled to a refund with the amount subject to calculation by miso on june 12 2009 however ferc issued an order on rehearing in which it affirmed its prior order clarifying the method to calculate the rsg first pass rate but reversed its ruling requiring the miso to pay refunds and collect surcharges on equitable grounds northern indiana has asked ferc to reconsider its decision to deny refunds and that request remains pending miso’s implementation of ferc’s april 2006 order on the rsg first pass calculation resulted in several million dollars of surcharges to northern indiana through market resettlements implemented during the summer of 2007 as a result northern indiana and ameren jointly filed a complaint with ferc on august 10 2007 contending that the rsg rates in effect were unjust and unreasonable on november 10 2008 the ferc issued an order granting these complaints and ordering the miso to calculate refunds and surcharges as appropriate back to the date of the complaint filed by northern indiana and ameren as authorized by section 206 of the federal power act on may 6 2009 however the ferc issued an order that upheld its decision granting the complaint but largely reversed its directive requiring miso to pay refunds and collect surcharges on equitable grounds the ferc affirmed the refund and surcharge requirement only for those transactions that occurred after the date of the november 10 2008 order instead of august 10 2007 as it had previously required northern indiana and ameren have requested rehearing of the ferc’s may 6 2009 order and that request remains pending 

miso and pjm interconnection undertook a joint effort in april and may 2009 to identify a source of unaccounted for flows on several coordinated flowgates the analysis found that certain pjm interconnection generating units that were once associated with unitspecific capacity sales were erroneously excluded from pjm interconnection’s market flows which significantly affected the congestion price on reciprocally coordinated flowgates on northern indiana systems higher pjm interconnection market flows on congested flowgates would have resulted in higher payments to miso by pjm interconnection during market to market coordination since april 1 2005 the model was fixed on june 18 2009 and miso and pjm interconnection are currently in settlement discussions with the ferc that began on october 19 2009 to determine the financial impact of any resettlements initial amounts calculated by pjm interconnection approximated 78 million while miso has performed a preliminary estimate of 125 to 150 million the impact to northern indiana cannot be reasonably estimated until a settlement is reached

between miso and pjm interconnection and miso receives approval from the ferc on an allocation methodology to its market participants any adjustment will be neutral or favorable to operations 

cost recovery and trackers a significant portion of northern indiana’s revenue is related to the recovery of fuel costs to generate power and the fuel costs related to purchased power these costs are recovered through a fac a standard quarterly “summary” regulatory proceeding in indiana various intervenors including the oucc had taken issue with the allocation of costs included in northern indiana’s fac80 fac81 and fac82 which cover the reconciliation of april — december 2008 the iurc granted a subdocket to consider such issues in those filings the intervening parties and northern indiana discussed procedures to eliminate these concerns and to resolve them for the historical periods on november 4 2009 the iurc approved a settlement agreement which calls for a credit of 82 million to be provided to fac customers beginning in november 2009 less any amount for attorney’s fees and expenses 

on may 28 2008 the iurc issued an order approving the purchase of sugar creek and on may 30 2008 northern indiana purchased the 535mw ccgt for 330 million in order to help meet capacity needs on february 18 2009 the iurc issued an order approving a settlement agreement filed in this proceeding allowing northern indiana to begin deferring carrying costs and depreciation pending inclusion in rates on sugar creek effective on december 1 2008 when sugar creek was dispatched into miso at the agreed to carrying cost rate of 65 the annual deferral for sugar creek is reduced by the annual depreciation on the mitchell plant of 45 million pursuant to the fac71 settlement the terms of recovery of the deferral and inclusion of sugar creek in rates will be resolved in northern indiana’s current rate proceeding 

as part of a settlement agreement which resolved issues surrounding purchased power costs northern indiana implemented a new “benchmarking standard” that became effective in october 2007 which defines the price above which purchased power costs must be absorbed by northern indiana and are not permitted to be passed on to ratepayers the benchmark is based upon the costs of power generated by a hypothetical natural gas fired unit using gas purchased and delivered to northern indiana and a set sharing mechanism during 2009 and 2008 the amount of purchased power costs exceeding the benchmark amounted to 10 million and 111 million respectively which was recognized as a net reduction of revenues the agreement also contemplated northern indiana adding generating capacity to its existing portfolio by providing for the benchmark to be adjusted as new capacity is added the dispatch of sugar creek into miso on december 1 2008 triggered a change in the benchmark whereby the first 500 mw tier of the benchmark provision was eliminated 

northern indiana has approval from the iurc to recover certain environmental related costs through an ect under the ect northern indiana is permitted to recover 1 afudc and a return on the capital investment expended by northern indiana to implement idem’s nox sip and cair and camr compliance plan projects through an ecrm and 2 related operation and maintenance and depreciation expenses once the environmental facilities become operational through an eerm northern indiana anticipates a total capital investment of approximately 510 million this revised cost estimate is subject to and pending approval by the iurc on october 28 2009 the iurc approved ecr14 for recovery of items described above based upon a capital expenditure level net of accumulated depreciation of 2712 million

sales 

electric operations sales were 155257 gwh for the year 2009 a decrease of 19168 gwh compared to 2008 the decrease occurred across all customer bases compared to the prior year primarily as a result of the economic downturn and the impact of unfavorable weather industrial customer volumes sold were down approximately 17 primarily due to a sharp decline in major steel companies’ production in october 2008 which bottomed near 50 in may 2009 since then nisource has seen growth in its power sales to these customers 

electric operations sales were 174425 gwh for the year 2008 a decrease of 3706 gwh compared to 2007 mainly resulting from lower residential sales due to cooler weather and decreased usage as well as from decreased industrial sales and wholesale volumes partially offset by higher commercial sales 

net revenues 

electric operations net revenues were 7649 million for 2009 a decrease of 410 million from 2008 this decrease was primarily the result of cooler weather of approximately 18 million lower industrial usage of 174 million mainly due to economic conditions lower sugar creek revenues from capacity and energy sales into the pjm interconnection of 135 million lower emission allowance sales of 95 million and lower offsystem sales of 91 million these decreases in net revenues were partially offset by higher residential and commercial usage of 124 million and lower nonrecoverable purchased power costs of 101 million 

electric operations net revenues were 8059 million for 2008 a decrease of 57 million from 2007 this decrease was primarily a result of lower residential sales volumes and lower residential and commercial margins of 195 million lower wholesale transactions of 141 million the impact of cooler weather of approximately 12 million 114 million of higher miso related costs and 80 million of nonrecoverable purchased power these decreases in net revenues were partially offset by the impact of a 335 million settlement in third quarter of 2007 related to the cost of power purchased in 2006 and 2007 the impact of a 109 million adjustment for estimated unbilled electric revenues recorded in 2007 62 million in increased industrial net revenues and incremental revenues of 61 million from the new sugar creek facility 

at northern indiana sales revenues and customer billings are adjusted for amounts related to under and overrecovered purchased fuel costs from prior periods per regulatory order these amounts are primarily reflected in the “other” gross revenues statistic provided at the beginning of this segment discussion the adjustment to other gross revenues for the twelve months ended december 31 2009 and 2008 was a revenue reduction of 202 million and 398 million respectively 

operating income 

operating income for 2009 was 1167 million a decrease of 1025 million from 2008 the decrease in operating income was due to increased operating expenses of 615 million and lower net revenues described above operating expenses increased due primarily to higher employee and administrative costs of 511 million increased legal reserves of 130 million higher electric generation and maintenance expenses of 62 million and 37 million of restructuring charges these increases in operating expenses were partially offset by lower property taxes of 63 million lower environmental expense of 54 million and lower depreciation of 40 million the increase in employee and administrative expense was primarily due to higher pension cost of 426 million the decrease in depreciation expense is mostly due to the impact of an 83 million adjustment recorded by northern indiana during the second quarter of 2008 

operating income for 2008 was 2192 million a decrease of 423 million from 2007 the decrease in operating income was due to increased operating expenses of 366 million and lower net revenues described above operating expenses increased primarily due to a 176 million increase in depreciation which includes an 83 million depreciation expense adjustment recorded during the second quarter of 2008 higher employee and administrative costs of 118 million higher electric generation and maintenance expenses of 75 million and 41 million of incremental costs associated with the sugar creek facility partially offset by lower property taxes of 39 million employee and administrative costs increased as a result of higher payroll costs for increased headcount and

profitability management continually seeks new ways to be more competitive and profitable in this changing environment including providing gas customers with increased choices for products and services 

natural gas competition open access to natural gas supplies over interstate pipelines and the deregulation of the commodity price of gas has led to tremendous change in the energy markets ldc customers and marketers purchase gas directly from producers and marketers and an open competitive market for gas supplies has emerged this separation or “unbundling” of the transportation and other services offered by pipelines and ldcs allows customers to purchase the commodity independent of services provided by the pipelines and ldcs the ldcs continue to purchase gas and recover the associated costs from their customers nisource’s gas distribution operations’ subsidiaries are involved in programs that provide customers the opportunity to purchase their natural gas requirements from third parties and use the nisource gas distribution operations’ subsidiaries for transportation services 

electric competition northern indiana currently sells all power from its plants into the miso transmission service for northern indiana occurs under the miso open access transmission tariff

on december 16 2008 standard and poor’s affirmed its senior unsecured ratings for nisource and its subsidiaries at bbb however it changed the ratings outlook for nisource and all of its subsidiaries to negative from stable on february 4 2009 moody’s investors services affirmed the senior unsecured ratings for nisource at baa3 and the existing ratings of all other subsidiaries moody’s outlook for nisource and its subsidiaries is negative on february 4 2009 fitch lowered its senior unsecured ratings for nisource to bbb and for northern indiana to bbb fitch’s outlook for nisource and all of its subsidiaries is stable although all ratings continue to be investment grade an additional downgrade by standard and poor’s moody’s or fitch would result in a rating that is below investment grade 

certain nisource affiliates have agreements that contain “ratings triggers” that require increased collateral if the credit ratings of nisource or certain of its subsidiaries are rated below bbb by standard and poor’s or baa3 by moody’s the collateral requirement from a downgrade below the ratings trigger levels would amount to approximately 30 million in addition to agreements with ratings triggers there are other agreements that contain “adequate assurance” or “material adverse change” provisions that could result in additional credit support such as letters of credit and cash collateral to transact business in addition under northern indiana’s trade receivables sales program northern indiana may not sell any new receivables if northern indiana’s debt rating falls below bbb or baa3 by standard and poor’s or moody’s respectively 

adverse economic and market conditions and increases in interest rates may reduce net revenue growth increase costs decrease future net income and cash flows and impact capital resources and liquidity needs 

the credit markets and the general economy have been experiencing a period of largescale turmoil and upheaval characterized by the bankruptcy failure collapse or sale of various financial institutions and an unprecedented level of intervention from the united states federal government while the ultimate outcome of these events cannot be predicted it may have an adverse material effect on nisource 

item 1a risk factors continued 

nisource inc 

a decline in the economy impacting nisource’s operating jurisdictions could adversely affect nisource’s ability to grow its customer base and collect revenues from customers which could reduce net revenue growth and increase operating costs an increase in the interest rates nisource pays would adversely affect future net income and cash flows in addition nisource depends on debt to finance its operations including both working capital and capital expenditures and would be adversely affected by increases in interest rates the current economic downturn and tightening of access to credit markets coupled with nisource’s current credit ratings could impact nisource’s ability to raise additional capital or refinance debt at a reasonable cost refer to note 16 “longterm debt” of the consolidated financial statements for information related to outstanding longterm debt and maturities of that debt 

capital market performance and other factors may decrease the value of benefit plan assets which then could require significant additional funding and impact earnings 

the performance of the capital markets affects the value of the assets that are held in trust to satisfy future obligations under defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans nisource has significant obligations in these areas and holds significant assets in these trusts these assets are subject to market fluctuations and may yield uncertain returns which fall below nisource’s projected rates of return a decline in the market value of assets may increase the funding requirements of the obligations under the defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans additionally changes in interest rates affect the liabilities under these benefit plans as interest rates decrease the liabilities increase which could potentially increase funding requirements further the funding requirements of the obligations related to these benefits plans may increase due to changes in governmental regulations and participant demographics including increased numbers of retirements or changes in life expectancy assumptions ultimately significant funding requirements and increased pension expense could negatively impact nisource’s results of operations and financial position 

nisource’s costs of compliance with environmental laws are significant the costs of compliance with future environmental laws and the incurrence of environmental liabilities could impact cash flow and profitability 

nisource’s subsidiaries are subject to extensive federal state and local environmental requirements that among other things regulate air emissions water usage and discharges remediation and the management of chemicals hazardous waste and solid waste compliance with these legal obligations requires nisource to commit significant expenditures for installation of pollution control equipment remediation environmental monitoring emissions fees and permits at many of nisource’s facilities these expenditures are significant and nisource expects that they will continue to be significant in the future 

nisource subsidiaries emit greenhouse gases as a result of operations future legislative and regulatory programs could significantly restrict emissions of these greenhouse gases compliance costs associated with these requirements could potentially be significant and affect cash flow and profitability 

if nisource’s subsidiaries fail to comply with environmental laws and regulations or cause harm to the environment or persons even if caused by factors beyond nisource’s control that failure or harm may result in the assessment of civil or criminal penalties and damages against nisource and its subsidiaries in september 2004 the epa issued an nov to northern indiana alleging violations of the new source review provisions of the caa an adverse outcome in this matter could require capital expenditures beyond the epa requirements that cannot be determined at this time and could require payment of substantial penalties 

existing environmental laws and regulations may be revised and new laws and regulations seeking to protect the environment may be adopted or become applicable to nisource’s subsidiaries revised or additional laws and regulations could result in significant additional expense and operating restrictions on nisource’s facilities or increased compliance costs which may not be fully recoverable from customers and would therefore reduce net income the cost impact of any new or amended legislation would depend upon the specific requirements enacted and cannot be determined at this time 

a significant portion of the gas and electricity nisource sells is used by residential and commercial customers for heating and air conditioning accordingly the operating results fluctuate depending on the weather and to a certain extent usage of gas or electricity 

item 1a risk factors continued 

nisource inc 

energy sales are sensitive to variations in weather forecasts of energy sales are based on normal weather which represents a longterm historical average significant variations from normal weather could have and have had a material impact on energy sales additionally residential usage and to some degree commercial usage have shown to be sensitive to fluctuations in commodity costs for gas and electricity whereby usage declines with increased costs thus affecting nisource’s financial results lastly residential and commercial customers’ usage has shown to be sensitive to economic conditions and the impact of macroeconomic drivers such as unemployment consumption and consumer confidence which could also affect nisource’s financial results 

nisource’s electric operations are subject to economic conditions in certain industries 

electric operations in northern indiana have been and may continue to be adversely affected by events in the steel and steel related industries in particular sales to large industrial customers within these steel and steel related industries may be impacted by economic downturns the us steel industry continues to adjust to changing market conditions including international competition increased costs and fluctuating demand for their products 

the majority of nisource’s net revenues are subject to economic regulation and are exposed to the impact of regulatory rate reviews and proceedings 

virtually all of nisource’s net revenues are subject to economic regulation at either the federal or state level as such the net revenues generated by those regulated companies are subject to regulatory review by the applicable federal or state authority these rate reviews determine the energy rates charged to customers and directly impact revenues as part of a settlement reached in a previous regulatory proceeding northern indiana filed a petition for new electric base rates and charges on june 27 2008 and filed its caseinchief on august 29 2008 assuming the case goes through the full procedural schedule without settlement the final hearing is scheduled to begin july 27 2009 and new rates are anticipated to take effect in early 2010 the outcome for any rate case could have a material effect on nisource’s financial results 

nisource is exposed to risk that customers will not remit payment for delivered energy or services and that suppliers or counterparties will not perform under various financial or operating agreements 

nisource’s extension of credit is governed by a corporate credit risk policy involves considerable judgment and is based on an evaluation of a customer or counterparty’s financial condition credit history and other factors credit risk exposure is monitored by obtaining credit reports and updated financial information for customers and suppliers and by evaluating the financial status of its banking partners and other counterparties through the use of marketbased metrics such as credit default swap pricing levels and also through traditional credit ratings provided by the major credit rating agencies 

nisource has significant goodwill and amortizable intangible assets an impairment of goodwill or amortizable intangible assets could result in a significant charge to earnings 

in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles nisource tests goodwill for impairment at least annually and reviews its amortizable intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable goodwill would also be tested for impairment when factors might indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable such as reduced cash flow estimates another factor could be a sustained decline in the stock price and market capitalization below the book value nisource would be required to record a charge in the financial statements during the period in which any impairment of the goodwill or amortizable intangible assets is determined negatively impacting the results of operations a significant charge could impact the capitalization ratio covenant under the fiveyear revolving credit facility and the twoyear term loan facility this covenant requires nisource to maintain a debt to capitalization ratio that does not exceed 70 a similar covenant in the 2005 private placement requires nisource to maintain a debt to capitalization ratio that does not exceed 75

financial management of the balance sheet 

nisource’s interest expense decreased 222 million for the year ended december 31 2008 compared to last year this decrease was due primarily to lower shortterm interest rates and the retirement late in 2007 of high cost debt associated with the whiting clean energy facility

accordion feature within the agreement the facility could potentially be expanded to as much as 500 million it is currently anticipated that the aggregate bank commitments under this facility will increase to 350 million by april 2009

process and expense management 

ibm agreement in december 2007 nisource and ibm finalized a restructuring of their business services agreement under the restructured agreement ibm will primarily provide information technology services with a number of other business service functions to be transitioned back to the nisource organization during 2008 certain meter to cash human resources sales center remaining finance and accounting except for accounts payable and supply chain management support services transitioned back to the company nisource has made a decision to transition certain accounts payable functions to another service provider

2009 outlook 

earnings from continuing operations for 2009 are expected to fall within a range of 100 to 110 per basic share the most significant downward impact on nisource’s nearterm earnings outlook relates to an increase in pension expense of approximately 100 million or 24 cents per basic share in 2009 due to the deterioration in the value of plan assets in 2008 interest expense is also expected to increase over 2008 levels by approximately 50 million or 12 cents per basic share

results of operations 

the consolidated review information should be read taking into account the critical accounting policies applied by nisource and discussed in “other information” of this item 7 

income from continuing operations and net income 

for the twelve months ended december 31 2008 nisource reported income from continuing operations of 3698 million or 135 per basic share compared to 3029 million or 110 per basic share in 2007 income from continuing operations before the cumulative change in accounting principle for the twelve months ended december 31 2006 was 3338 million or 122 per basic share 

including results from discontinued operations nisource reported 2008 net income of 790 million or 029 per basic share 2007 net income of 3214 million or 117 per basic share and 2006 net income of 2822 million or 104 per basic share 

comparability of line item operating results was impacted by regulatory and tax trackers that allow for the recovery in rates of certain costs such as bad debt expenses therefore increases in these tracked operating expenses are offset by increases in net revenues and had essentially no impact on income from continuing operations an increase in operating expenses of 175 million for the 2008 year was offset by a corresponding increase to net revenues reflecting recovery of these tracked costs in the 2007 period an increase in operating expenses of 251 million for trackers was offset by a corresponding increase to net revenues reflecting recovery of these costs these increases in 2008 and in 2007 were largely attributable to higher uncollectible accounts 

net revenues 

nisource analyzes the operating results using net revenues net revenues are calculated as revenues less the associated cost of sales excluding depreciation and amortization nisource believes net revenues is a better measure to analyze profitability than gross operating revenues since the majority of the cost of sales are tracked costs that are passed through directly to the customer resulting in an equal and offsetting amount reflected in gross operating revenues 

total consolidated net revenues gross revenues less cost of sales excluding depreciation and amortization for the twelve months ended december 31 2008 were 32426 million a 556 million increase compared with 2007 the increase in net revenues is from higher gas distribution operations net revenue which increased by 62 million this increase in net revenues was due primarily to regulatory and service programs including impacts from rate proceedings at columbia of pennsylvania columbia of ohio columbia of kentucky and bay state of 219 million increased trackers of 175 million offset in expense the impact of an adjustment for estimated unbilled revenues of 146 million recorded by northern indiana in 2007 and colder weather of approximately 9 million gas transmission and storage operations net revenues decreased 21 million mainly due to lower shorterterm transportation and storage services and commodity margin revenues of 240 million and the impact of a regulatory settlement of 90 million partially offset by increased subscriptions for firm transportation services of 231 million related to new interconnects along the columbia gulf pipeline system deliveries from the hardy storage field and incremental demand revenues on the columbia transmission system electric operations net revenues decreased 57 million from 2007 a result of lower residential sales volumes and lower residential and commercial margins of 195 million lower wholesale transactions of 141 million the impact of cooler weather of approximately 12 million and 114 million of higher miso related costs partially offset by the impact of a 335 million settlement in third quarter of 2007 related to the cost of power purchased by northern indiana in 2006 and 2007 and the impact of a 109 million adjustment for estimated unbilled electric revenues recorded in 2007 other operations net revenues were essentially flat compared with 2007 

total consolidated net revenues for the twelve months ended december 31 2007 were 31870 million a 1043 million increase compared with 2006 which includes the impact of 251 million of trackers discussed above nisource’s operating segments contributed to this overall increase in net revenues as follows gas distribution operations net revenues increased 939 million gas transmission and storage operations increased 208 million and electric operations decreased 108 million net revenue increases from gas distribution operations were primarily a result of favorable weather of approximately 71 million a 178 million increase in revenues from regulatory trackers which are primarily offset in operating expense and higher net revenues from regulatory

nisource inc 

initiatives and other service programs of 109 million partially offset by a 146 million adjustment for estimated unbilled revenues net revenues increased within gas transmission operations as a result of increased firm capacity reservation revenues of 198 million due in large part to the columbia gulf mainline pipeline being fully subscribed in 2007 electric operations net revenues were negatively impacted by a 335 million settlement related to the cost of power purchased by northern indiana in 2006 and 2007 lower industrial margins of 118 million a 109 million adjustment for estimated unbilled revenues and higher revenue credits of 51 million which more than offset increases in net revenues due to higher wholesale margins and volumes amounting to 196 million favorable weather of approximately 17 million higher residential and commercial volumes attributable to usage and increased customers of approximately 153 million and lower unrecoverable miso costs of 71 million 

expenses 

operating expenses were 23372 million in 2008 an increase of 575 million from the comparable 2007 period this increase was primarily due to higher employee and administrative expenses of 375 million a 270 million increase in depreciation which includes an 83 million depreciation expense adjustment recorded by northern indiana during the second quarter of 2008 and 66 million of depreciation for the new sugar creek plant higher electric generation and maintenance expenses of 116 million and higher gross receipts and other taxes of 92 million these increases in expense were partially offset by an adjustment decreasing employee benefits expense by 127 million and lower legal reserves of 107 million the 127 million adjustment decreasing employee benefit expenses was due to a misclassification in 2007 of certain medical claims this adjustment had no impact on actual medical claims paid or coverage to benefit participants the higher generation and maintenance expenses were primarily attributable to a planned turbine and boiler maintenance and a generator overhaul as well as 41 million in incremental costs associated with the sugar creek facility 

operating expenses were 22797 million in 2007 a 1251 million increase from 2006 which includes 251 million of increased expense that is recovered through trackers and corresponding increases in net revenues see discussion above this increase was primarily due to higher employee and administrative expenses of 669 million higher expense within electric operations for electric generation and storm damage restoration totaling 139 million higher depreciation of 87 million and increased other taxes of 129 million primarily due to property taxes the employee and administrative costs include payroll benefits and higher corporate services costs primarily related to the pricing structure under nisource’s original business services arrangement with ibm in december 2007 nisource and ibm finalized a restructuring of their business services agreement the restructured agreement provided that ibm would primarily provide information technology services while a number of other business service functions would be transitioned back to the nisource organization the impact of the amended agreement with ibm included a settlement charge of 98 million recorded during the fourth quarter of 2007 these increases in expenses were partially offset by the impact of a 170 million accrual recorded in fourth quarter of 2006 in conjunction with the bp contract revision 

equity earnings loss in unconsolidated affiliates 

equity earnings in unconsolidated affiliates increased 2008 operating income by 123 million compared to income of 94 million in 2007 equity earnings in unconsolidated affiliates includes investments in millennium and hardy storage which are integral to the gas transmission and storage operations business equity earnings increased 29 million due to higher afudc earnings from millennium partially offset by increased interest expense from hardy storage 

equity earnings loss in unconsolidated affiliates increased 2007 operating income by 94 million compared to a loss of 123 million in 2006 equity earnings increased 217 million due to hardy storage being placed in service in april 2007 higher afudc earnings from millennium and the impact of millennium recording a 130 million reserve in 2006 related to vacated portions of the original project 

other income deductions 

other income deductions in 2008 reduced income 3625 million compared to a reduction of 4493 million in 2007 this decrease in other deductions of 868 million was mainly due to lower interest expense higher other income and a redemption premium of 406 million which reduced income in 2007 related to the early extinguishment of longterm notes for whiting clean energy 

item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

nisource inc 

interest expense net was 3801 million for 2008 compared to 4023 million for last year this decrease of 222 million was mainly due to lower shortterm interest rates and credit facility fees and the retirement late in 2007 of high cost debt associated with the whiting clean energy facility other net was income of 176 million for 2008 compared to a loss of 64 million for the comparable 2007 period due to the sale of an investment and lower costs associated with the sale of accounts receivable on august 27 2008 nisource development company sold its interest in jof transportation company to lehigh service corporation for a pretax gain of 167 million jof transportation company held 40 interest in chicago south shore  south bend railroad co and a 40 interest in indiana illinois development company llc 

other income deductions in 2007 reduced income 4493 million compared to a reduction of 3978 million in 2006 this increase in other deductions of 515 million was mainly due to a redemption premium of 406 million related to the early extinguishment of longterm notes for whiting clean energy and to higher shortterm interest rates and credit facility fees 

income taxes 

income taxes increased by 209 million in 2008 as compared with 2007 the increase was due to higher pretax income offset by lower state income tax expense the effective income tax rates were 334 352 and 356 in 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively the 18 decrease in the overall effective tax rate in 2008 versus 2007 was primarily the result of a change in massachusetts state taxes discussed below income taxes decreased 197 million in 2007 as compared with 2006 primarily due to lower pretax income the 04 decrease in the overall effective tax rate in 2007 versus 2006 is due to higher section 199 deductions lower regulatory flowthrough depreciation and the capitalization of the tax impact of afudcequity to a regulatory asset these decreases were offset by increased state income tax expense 

on july 3 2008 the governor of massachusetts signed into law a bill that significantly changed the massachusetts corporate income tax regime under the new law which became effective for tax years beginning on or after january 1 2009 nisource calculates its massachusetts income tax liability on a unitary basis meaning that the income tax obligation to the commonwealth of massachusetts is determined based on an apportioned share of all of nisource’s income rather than just the income of nisource’s subsidiaries doing business in massachusetts because of nisource’s substantial operations outside of massachusetts the new law has the impact of reducing the deferred income tax liability to massachusetts under sfas no 109 nisource must recognize the impact of this tax law change in the quarter it is enacted as a result income tax expense and deferred income tax were reduced by 149 million in 2008 

discontinued operations 

discontinued operations reflected a loss of 2908 million or 106 loss per basic share in 2008 income of 185 million or 007 per basic share in 2007 and a loss of 520 million or 018 loss per basic share in 2006 

the loss in 2008 is primarily attributable to an adjustment to the reserve for the tawney litigation discussed previously and losses from businesses disposed during the year during 2008 nisource recorded an aftertax loss of 1082 million for the dispositions of northern utilities granite state gas and whiting clean energy in addition in the first quarter of 2008 nisource began accounting for the operations of northern utilities granite state gas and whiting clean energy as discontinued operations as such net income of 44 million and 90 million was classified as discontinued operations for the year ended 2008 and 2007 respectively and a net loss of 205 million was reclassified for 2006 in the third quarter of 2008 nisource began accounting for the operations of nisource retail services as discontinued operations as such net income from continuing operations of 08 million 01 million and 01 million was classified as discontinued operations for the twelve months ended december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively 

discontinued operations reflected income of 185 million or 007 per basic share in 2007 and an aftertax loss of 520 million or 018 loss per basic share in 2006 the 185 million of income from discontinued operations in 2007 includes net income from northern utilities granite state gas and whiting clean energy of 90 million a 75 million reduction net of taxes in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits and 09 million in related interest net of taxes associated with the issuance of additional tax guidance in the first quarter of 2007 the loss from discontinued operations in 2006 was primarily the result of an increase to legal reserves and the sale of certain lowincome housing investments

liquidity and capital resources 

a significant portion of nisource’s operations most notably in the gas distribution gas transportation and electric distribution businesses are subject to seasonal fluctuations in cash flow during the heating season which is primarily from november through march cash receipts from gas sales and transportation services typically exceed cash requirements during the summer months cash on hand together with the seasonal increase in cash flows from the electric business during the summer cooling season and external shortterm and longterm financing is used to purchase gas to place in storage for heating season deliveries and perform necessary maintenance of facilities 

operating activities 

net cash from operating activities for the twelve months ended december 31 2008 was 5853 million a decrease of 1719 million from a year ago a 1324 million increase in deferred taxes primarily related to bonus depreciation was more than offset by changes in assets and liabilities the impacts of gas prices and weather significantly impact working capital changes high gas prices and 8 colder than normal weather in the distribution markets during the fourth quarter of 2008 resulted in higher than normal accounts receivable balances at year end the average price of gas and increased storage injections resulted in increased inventory levels year over year requiring a use of cash in addition increases in regulatory assets including a deferred uncollectible expense to be recovered via the bad debt and pipp recovery programs and the pass back to customers per the columbia of ohio stipulation generated a use of working capital 

pension and other postretirement plan funding in 2009 nisource expects to make contributions of approximately 104 million to its pension plans and approximately 53 million to its postretirement medical and life plans nisource’s pension assets have incurred a negative return of 303 from asset values at december 31 2007 which will have an impact on future pension cash contributions and expense in 2009 pension expense net of amounts capitalized is projected to increase by approximately 100 million compared to 2008

item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

nisource inc 

 

for 2008 capital expenditures and certain other investing activities were 13066 million an increase of 5427 million over 2007 a significant amount of the increase was due to higher capital expenditures within electric operations of 3109 million this increase was primarily attributable to the acquisition of the sugar creek generating station 

capital expenditures increased within gas distribution operations and gas transmission and storage operations by 834 million and 1581 million respectively the increase within gas distribution operations segment was primarily due to higher expenditures in infrastructure replacement programs particularly in ohio and pennsylvania the increase within the gas transmission and storage operations segment was primarily due to new business initiatives to maintain and expand market share in storage and interstate transportation 

for 2009 the projected capital program and certain other investing activities are expected to be 8000 million which is 5066 million lower than the 2008 capital program this lower spending is mainly due to a decrease in the acquisition of incremental electric generation capacity reduced spending on infrastructure replacement programs and lower expenditures for growth projects primarily within the gas transmission and storage operations segment the program is expected to be funded through a combination of cash flow from operations and new longterm debt issuances during 2009 

nisource received proceeds from the sale of whiting clean energy northern utilities and granite state of 2167 million 1873 million and 143 million respectively 

on may 30 2008 northern indiana purchased sugar creek for 3297 million this purchase was in response to northern indiana’s need to add approximately 1000 mw of new capacity refer to note 5 “purchase of sugar creek plant” in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

restricted cash was 2866 million and 577 million for the years ended december 31 2008 and 2007 respectively the increase in restricted cash was due primarily to the change in forward gas prices which resulted in increased margin deposits on open derivative contracts used within nisource’s risk management and energy marketing activities 

nisource received insurance proceeds for capital repairs of 467 million 174 million and 106 million related to hurricanes and other items in 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively

commodity price risk 

nisource is exposed to commodity price risk as a result of its subsidiaries’ operations involving natural gas and power to manage this market risk nisource’s subsidiaries use derivatives including commodity futures contracts swaps and options nisource is not involved in speculative energy trading activity 

commodity price risk resulting from derivative activities at nisource’s rateregulated subsidiaries is limited since regulations allow recovery of prudently incurred purchased power fuel and gas costs through the ratemaking process including gains or losses on these derivative instruments if states should explore additional regulatory reform these subsidiaries may begin providing services without the benefit of the traditional ratemaking process and may be more exposed to commodity price risk some of nisource’s rateregulated utility subsidiaries offer commodity price risk products to its customers for which derivatives are used to hedge forecasted customer usage under such products these subsidiaries do not have regulatory recovery orders for these products and are subject to gains and losses recognized in earnings due to hedge ineffectiveness 

during 2008 and 2007 a loss of 03 million and gain of 03 million net of taxes respectively were recognized in earnings due to the ineffectiveness of derivative instruments being accounted for as hedges all derivatives classified as a hedge are assessed for hedge effectiveness with any components determined to be ineffective charged to earnings or classified as a regulatory asset or liability per sfas no 71 as appropriate during 2008 and 2007 nisource did not reclassify any amounts related to its cash flow hedges from accumulated other comprehensive income loss to earnings due to the probability that certain forecasted transactions would not occur it is anticipated that during the next twelve months the expiration and settlement of cash flow hedge contracts will result in income statement recognition of amounts currently classified in accumulated other comprehensive income loss of approximately 539 million of loss net of taxes refer to note 9 “risk management and energy marketing activities” in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information on nisource’s various derivative programs for managing commodity price risk 

nisource subsidiaries are required to make cash margin deposits with their brokers to cover actual and potential losses in the value of outstanding exchange traded derivative contracts the amount of these deposits which are reflected in nisource’s restricted cash balance may fluctuate significantly during periods of high volatility in the energy commodity markets 

interest rate risk 

nisource is exposed to interest rate risk as a result of changes in interest rates on borrowings under revolving credit agreements and floating rate notes which have interest rates that are indexed to shortterm market interest rates nisource is also exposed to interest rate risk due to changes in interest rates on fixedtovariable interest rate swaps that hedge the fair value of longterm debt based upon average borrowings and debt obligations subject to fluctuations in shortterm market interest rates an increase or decrease in shortterm interest rates of 100 basis points 1 would have increased or decreased interest expense by 250 million and 272 million for the years 2008 and 2007 respectively 

contemporaneously with the pricing of the 525 and 545 notes issued september 16 2005 nisource finance settled 900 million of forward starting interest rate swap agreements with six counterparties nisource paid an aggregate settlement payment of 355 million which is being amortized as an increase to interest expense over the term of the underlying debt resulting in an effective interest rate of 567 and 588 respectively 

nisource has entered into interest rate swap agreements to modify the interest rate characteristics of its outstanding longterm debt from fixed to variable on may 12 2004 nisource finance entered into fixedtovariable interest rate swap agreements in a notional amount of 660 million with six counterparties having a 6 12year term nisource finance will receive payments based upon a fixed 7875 interest rate and pay a floating interest amount based on us 6month bba libor plus an average of 308 per annum there was no exchange of premium at the initial date of the swaps in addition each party has the right to cancel the swaps on may 15 2009 on september 15 2008 nisource finance terminated a fixedtovariable interest rate swap agreement with lehman brothers having a notional amount of 110 million 

on july 22 2003 nisource finance entered into fixedtovariable interest rate swap agreements in a notional amount of 500 million with four counterparties with an 11year term nisource finance will receive payments 

item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

nisource inc 

based upon a fixed 540 interest rate and pay a floating interest amount based on us 6month bba libor plus an average of 078 per annum there was no exchange of premium at the initial date of the swaps in addition each party has the right to cancel the swaps on july 15 2013 

as a result of these fixedtovariable interest rate swap transactions 1050 million of nisource finance’s existing longterm debt is now subject to fluctuations in interest rates 

credit risk 

due to the nature of the industry credit risk is embedded in many of nisource’s business activities nisource’s extension of credit is governed by a corporate credit risk policy in addition risk management committee guidelines are in place which document management approval levels for credit limits evaluation of creditworthiness and credit risk mitigation efforts exposures to credit risks are monitored by the corporate credit risk function which is independent of commercial operations credit risk arises due to the possibility that a customer supplier or counterparty will not be able or willing to fulfill its obligations on a transaction on or before the settlement date for derivative related contracts credit risk arises when counterparties are obligated to deliver or purchase defined commodity units of gas or power to nisource at a future date per execution of contractual terms and conditions exposure to credit risk is measured in terms of both current obligations and the market value of forward positions net of any posted collateral such as cash letters of credit and qualified guarantees of support 

as a result of the ongoing credit crisis in the financial markets nisource has been closely monitoring the financial status of its banking credit providers and interest rate swap counterparties nisource continues to evaluate the financial status of its banking partners through the use of marketbased metrics such as credit default swap pricing levels and also through traditional credit ratings provided by the major credit rating agencies as of december 31 2008 the us treasury department has injected approximately 243 billion into us financial institutions the tarp capital purchase program in an attempt to improve the financial position of us banks 

prior to the us treasury’s announcement of the tarp capital purchase program and the announcement of certain bank acquisitions as described above the parent company of one of nisource’s interest rate swap counterparties lehman brothers holdings inc filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection impacting the status of an outstanding swap in the notional amount of 110 million as a result on september 15 2008 nisource finance terminated a fixedtovariable interest rate swap agreement with lehman brothers nisource finance elected to terminate the swap when lehman holdings inc guarantor under the applicable international swaps and derivatives association agreement filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on september 14 2008 which constituted an event of default under the swap agreement between nisource finance and lehman brothers special financing inc the marktomarket closeout value of this swap at the september 15 2008 termination date was determined to be 48 million and was fully reserved in the third quarter of 2008 

nisource also reviewed its exposure to all other counterparties including the other interest rate swap counterparties and concluded there was no significant risk associated with these counterparties nisource will continue to closely monitor events in the credit markets as well as overall economic conditions in the nation and the markets we serve 

fair value measurement 

nisource measures fair value in accordance with sfas no 157 for its financial assets and liabilities the level of the fair value hierarchy disclosed is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement nisource’s financial assets and liabilities include price risk assets and liabilities availableforsale securities and a deferred compensation plan obligation 

exchangetraded derivative contracts are generally based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets and are classified within level 1 these financial assets and liabilities are secured with cash on deposit with the exchange therefore nonperformance risk has not been incorporated into these valuations certain nonexchangetraded derivatives are valued using broker or overthecounter online exchanges in such cases these nonexchangetraded derivatives are classified within level 2 nonexchangebased derivative instruments include swaps forwards and options in certain instances these instruments may utilize models to measure fair value the company uses a similar model to value similar instruments valuation models utilize various inputs that include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active other observable inputs for the asset or liability and marketcorroborated 

item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

nisource inc 

inputs ie inputs derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means where observable inputs are available for substantially the full term of the asset or liability the instrument is categorized in level 2 certain derivatives trade in less active markets with a lower availability of pricing information and models may be utilized in the valuation when such inputs have a significant impact on the measurement of fair value the instrument is categorized in level 3 credit risk is considered in the fair value calculation of derivative instruments that are not exchangetraded credit exposures are adjusted to reflect collateral agreements which reduce exposures 

price risk management assets also include fixedtofloating interestrate swaps which are designated as fair value hedges as a means to achieve its targeted level of variablerate debt as a percent of total debt nisource uses a calculation of future cash inflows and estimated future outflows related to the swap agreements which are discounted and netted to determine the current fair value additional inputs to the present value calculation include the contract terms as well as market parameters such as current and projected interest rates and volatility as they are based on observable data and valuations of similar instruments the interestrate swaps are categorized in level 2 in the fair value hierarchy credit risk is considered in the fair value calculation of the interest rate swap 

refer to note 18 “fair value disclosures” in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on nisource’s fair value measurements 

market risk measurement 

market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices rates indices volatilities correlations or other market factors such as liquidity will result in losses for a specified position or portfolio nisource calculates a oneday var at a 95 confidence level for the gas marketing group that utilizes a variancecovariance methodology the daily market exposure for the gas marketing portfolio on an average high and low basis was 02 million 03 million and zero during 2008 respectively prospectively management has set the var limit at 08 million for gas marketing exceeding this limit would result in management actions to reduce portfolio risk 

refer to “critical accounting policies” included in this item 7 and note 1u “accounting for risk management and energy marketing activities” and note 9 “risk management and energy marketing activities” in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of nisource’s risk management 

other information 

critical accounting policies 

nisource applies certain accounting policies based on the accounting requirements discussed below that have had and may continue to have significant impacts on nisource’s results of operations and consolidated balance sheets 

basis of accounting for rateregulated subsidiaries sfas no 71 provides that rateregulated subsidiaries account for and report assets and liabilities consistent with the economic effect of the way in which regulators establish rates if the rates established are designed to recover the costs of providing the regulated service and if the competitive environment makes it probable that such rates can be charged and collected nisource’s rateregulated subsidiaries follow the accounting and reporting requirements of sfas no 71 certain expenses and credits subject to utility regulation or rate determination normally reflected in income are deferred on the consolidated balance sheets and are recognized in income as the related amounts are included in service rates and recovered from or refunded to customers the total amounts of regulatory assets and liabilities reflected on the consolidated balance sheets were 19553 million and 14265 million at december 31 2008 and 10829 million and 14255 million at december 31 2007 respectively for additional information refer to note 1f “basis of accounting for rateregulated subsidiaries” in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

in the event that regulation significantly changes the opportunity for nisource to recover its costs in the future all or a portion of nisource’s regulated operations may no longer meet the criteria for the application of sfas no 71 in such event a writedown of all or a portion of nisource’s existing regulatory assets and liabilities could result if transition cost recovery is approved by the appropriate regulatory bodies that would meet the requirements under generally accepted accounting principles for continued accounting as regulatory assets and liabilities during such 

item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

nisource inc 

recovery period the regulatory assets and liabilities would be reported at the recoverable amounts if unable to continue to apply the provisions of sfas no 71 nisource would be required to apply the provisions of sfas no 101 in management’s opinion nisource’s regulated subsidiaries will be subject to sfas no 71 for the foreseeable future 

certain of the regulatory assets reflected on nisource’s consolidated balance sheets require specific regulatory action in order to be included in future service rates although recovery of these amounts is not guaranteed nisource believes that these costs meet the requirements for deferral as regulatory assets under sfas no 71 regulatory assets requiring specific regulatory action amounted to 2372 million at december 31 2008 if nisource determined that the amounts included as regulatory assets were not recoverable a charge to income would immediately be required to the extent of the unrecoverable amounts 

accounting for risk management activities under sfas no 133 the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and resulting designation unrealized and realized gains and losses are recognized each period as components of accumulated other comprehensive income loss earnings or regulatory assets and liabilities depending on the nature of such derivatives for subsidiaries that utilize derivatives for cash flow hedges the effective portions of the gains and losses are recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income loss and are recognized in earnings concurrent with the disposition of the hedged risks for fair value hedges the gains and losses are recorded in earnings each period along with the change in the fair value of the hedged item as a result of the ratemaking process the rateregulated subsidiaries generally record gains and losses as regulatory liabilities or assets and recognize such gains or losses in earnings when both the contracts settle and the physical commodity flows these gains and losses recognized in earnings are then subsequently recovered or passed back in revenues through rates 

in order for a derivative contract to be designated as a hedge the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item or transaction must be highly effective the effectiveness test is performed at the inception of the hedge and each reporting period thereafter throughout the period that the hedge is designated any amounts determined to be ineffective are recorded currently in earnings 

although nisource applies some judgment in the assessment of hedge effectiveness to designate certain derivatives as hedges the nature of the contracts used to hedge the underlying risks is such that there is a high risk correlation of the changes in fair values of the derivatives and the underlying risks nisource generally uses nymex exchangetraded natural gas futures and options contracts and overthecounter swaps based on published indices to hedge the risks underlying its naturalgasrelated businesses nisource had 3511 million and 1274 million of price risk management assets of which 3442 million and 1135 million related to hedges at december 31 2008 and 2007 respectively and 4750 million and 816 million of price risk management liabilities of which 4050 million and 553 million related to hedges at december 31 2008 and 2007 respectively the amount of unrealized gains losses recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income loss net of taxes was a loss of 1398 million and a gain of 76 million at december 31 2008 and 2007 respectively 

pensions and postretirement benefits nisource has defined benefit plans for both pensions and other postretirement benefits the plans are accounted for under sfas no 87 sfas no 88 and sfas no 106 as amended by sfas no 158 the calculation of the net obligations and annual expense related to the plans requires a significant degree of judgment regarding the discount rates to be used in bringing the liabilities to present value longterm returns on plan assets and employee longevity among other assumptions due to the size of the plans and the longterm nature of the associated liabilities changes in the assumptions used in the actuarial estimates could have material impacts on the measurement of the net obligations and annual expense recognition for further discussion of nisource’s pensions and other postretirement benefits see note 12 “pension and other postretirement benefits” in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

goodwill impairment testing  as of december 31 2008 nisource had 37 billion of goodwill on the consolidated balance sheet which was mainly due to the acquisition of columbia 

in the quarters ended june 30 2008 and june 30 2007 nisource performed its annual impairment test of goodwill associated with the purchases of columbia northern indiana fuel and light and kokomo gas sfas no 142 requires that the impairment test be performed through the application of a twostep fair value test the first step of

the test compares the fair values of the reporting units with the carrying amounts including goodwill an impairment of goodwill results when there is an excess of book value over the fair value of a reporting unit the second step would then need to be performed to quantify the impairment charge if any which would be measured by comparing the implied value of goodwill to its carrying amount the implied fair value of goodwill for each reporting unit is determined by assigning the fair value of the reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination any excess of fair value of the reporting unit over the amounts allocated to the assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill 

the results of the june 30 2008 and june 30 2007 annual impairment tests indicated that no impairment charge was required for the purpose of testing for impairment of the goodwill recorded in the acquisition of columbia the related subsidiaries were aggregated into two distinct reporting units one within the gas distribution operations segment and one within the gas transmission and storage operations segment northern indiana fuel and light and kokomo gas are each separate reporting units within the gas distribution operations segment 

nisource uses an income approach to estimate the fair value of its reporting units for the purposes of this test the method is generally based on a discounted cash flow valuation model that incorporates internal projections of expected future cash flows and operating results to estimate a fair value of each reporting unit determining fair value requires management to make a number of judgments about assumptions and estimates used in the model that are subjective and include unobservable inputs or assumptions the use of alternate judgments andor assumptions could have a material impact on the financial statements 

certain key assumptions include the fiveyear plan operating results discount rates and the longterm outlook for growth rates among other items the discount rate used based on the weighted average cost of capital was 676 in the june 30 2008 annual impairment test which was a decrease from the prior year’s rate of 73 due primarily to a decrease in the riskfree rate and market risk premium operating income growth rates were 393 for the columbia distribution reporting unit and 349 for the columbia transmission reporting unit in the 2008 test which were comparable to the growth rates used in the prior year 

nisource continually monitors potential indicators of impairment to determine if any triggering events are present that would require an impairment test more frequently than the annual test 

as of december 31 2008 nisource’s market capitalization was approximately 30 billion while nisource’s net assets inclusive of goodwill were 47 billion nisource’s market capitalization at june 30 2008 of approximately 49 billion was above nisource’s net asset value when the annual impairment test was performed in accordance with paragraph 28 of sfas no 142 nisource considered whether there were any events or changes in circumstances during the second half of 2008 that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of any of the reporting units below their carrying amounts and necessitate another goodwill impairment test and concluded that there were none nisource attributes the decline in its market capitalization primarily to the overall stock market decline resulting from the credit crisis taking place in the united states and globally and not any fundamental change in nisource’s regulated gas distribution and gas transmission and storage businesses that comprise the reporting units for which goodwill is attributable nisource’s stock price decline of 419 from december 31 2007 compares to the overall declines of the sp utilities average and dow jones industrial average of 315 and 338 respectively over the same twelvemonth time period the following events likely contributed to a greater decline in nisource’s stock price during the fourth quarter ended december 31 2008 as compared to the overall market and industry performance during the same period but these events had no impact on the goodwill bearing reporting units on october 24 2008 a west virginia circuit court approved a 380 million settlement for tawney a legal settlement related to discontinued operation entity cnr which was sold in 2003 nisource’s share of the settlement liability is up to 3388 million this settlement as well as difficult credit markets likely contributed to standard  poor’s changing the outlook for nisource to negative all rating agencies have classified nisource as investment grade in addition the northern indiana electric rate case was filed on june 27 2008 and the initial hearings began in january 2009 this is the first electric rate case in 20 years and is causing further uncertainty in the market place that may be depressing nisource’s stock price the entity involved in this rate case does not carry goodwill 

given the lack of a fundamental change in the underlying businesses that carry goodwill and their various assets nisource does not believe the decline in its stock price and the underlying reasons for that decline are indicative of an actual decline in the company’s fair value of the underlying assets

nisource’s reportable entities with goodwill consist of regulated companies regulated recovery rates and approved rate of returns allow for more predictable and steady streams of revenues and cash flows which help mitigate the impacts that might otherwise be felt from the recessionary trends seen in other industries and also adds more reliability to the cash flow forecasts used to calculate fair value nisource reviewed its estimates and assumptions used in the discounted cash flow model at june 30 2008 noting that there are no significant changes that would be made in light of the changing economic circumstances during the last half of the year in addition the 2008 operating results for the gas distribution operations and gas transmission and storage operations segments exceeded and were in line respectively with 2008 estimates used to calculate fair value in the june 30 2008 annual impairment test favorable rate case outcomes within gas distribution operations and growth projects and increased firm capacity reservation fees within gas transmission and storage operations contributed to the favorable results 

it should also be noted that nisource has demonstrated the ability to obtain credit as evidenced by a new shortterm credit facility of 500 million that was obtained on september 23 2008 northern indiana’s reissuance of the jasper county pollution control bonds for 254 million on august 25 2008 with a weighted average interest rate now fixed at 558 and the renewal of northern indiana’s 200 million accounts receivable facility in december 2008 in addition during february 2009 nisource negotiated a twoyear term loan facility with a syndicate of banks maturing in february 2011 borrowings under the facility will have an effective cost of libor plus 538 basis points the initial closing of the facility occurred on february 13 2009 with a subsequent closing expected to take place in early april under an “accordion” feature under which the facility can be expanded to 500 million prior to the final closing nisource has received bank commitments totaling 265 million with the ultimate level of the facility expected to be up to 350 million 

nisource’s intangible assets apart from goodwill consist of franchise rights which were identified as part of the purchase price allocations associated with the acquisition in february of 1999 of bay state these amounts were 3306 million and 3416 million net of amortization of 1116 million and 1006 million at december 31 2008 and 2007 respectively and are being amortized over forty years from the date of acquisition nisource recorded amortization expense of 110 million in 2008 2007 and 2006 related to its intangible assets

longlived asset impairment testing  nisource’s consolidated balance sheets contain longlived assets other than goodwill and intangible assets which are not subject to recovery under sfas no 71 as a result nisource assesses the carrying amount and potential earnings of these assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value could be impaired as per sfas no 144 when an asset’s carrying value exceeds the undiscounted estimated future cash flows associated with the asset the asset is considered to be impaired to the extent that the asset’s fair value is less than its carrying value refer to note 1k “longlived assets” in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 

contingencies a contingent liability is recognized when it is probable that an environmental tax legal or other liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can reasonably be estimated accounting for contingencies require significant management judgment regarding the estimated probabilities and ranges of exposure to a potential liability estimates of the loss and associated probability are made based on the current facts available including present laws and regulations management’s assessment of the contingent liability could change as a result of future events or as more information becomes available actual amounts could differ from estimates and can have a material impact on nisource’s results of operations and financial position refer to note 19 “other commitments and contingencies” in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 

asset retirement obligations nisource accounts for retirement obligations under the provisions of sfas no 143 as amended by fin 47 which require entities to record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred in the absence of quoted market prices fair value of asset retirement obligations are estimated using present value techniques using various assumptions including estimates of the amounts and timing of future cash flows associated with retirement activities inflation rates and creditadjusted risk free rates when the liability is initially recorded the entity capitalizes the cost thereby increasing the carrying amount of the related longlived asset over time the liability is accreted and the capitalized cost is depreciated

taxes nisource accounts for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 109  under sfas no 109 deferred income taxes are recognized for all temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities at currently enacted income tax rates 

sfas no 109 also requires recognition of the additional deferred income tax assets and liabilities for temporary differences where regulators prohibit deferred income tax treatment for ratemaking purposes regulatory assets or liabilities corresponding to such additional deferred tax assets or liabilities may be recorded to the extent recoverable from or payable to customers through the ratemaking process amounts applicable to income taxes due from and due to customers primarily represent differences between the book and tax basis of net utility plant in service 

recently adopted accounting pronouncements 

sfas no 157 — fair value measurements in september 2006 the fasb issued sfas no 157 to define fair value establish a framework for measuring fair value and to expand disclosures about fair value measurements sfas no 157 does not change the requirements to apply fair value in existing accounting standards 

under sfas no 157 fair value refers to the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants in the market in which the reporting entity transacts the standard clarifies that fair value should be based on the assumptions market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability 

to increase consistency and comparability in fair value measurements sfas no 157 establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three levels the level in the fair value hierarchy disclosed is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement the three levels of the fair value hierarchy defined by sfas no 157 are as follows 

 

sfas no 157 became effective for nisource as of january 1 2008 the provisions of sfas no 157 are to be applied prospectively except for the initial impact on the following three items which are required to be recorded as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the year of adoption 1 changes in fair value measurements of existing derivative financial instruments measured initially using the transaction price under eitf issue no 023 2 existing hybrid financial instruments measured initially at fair value using the transaction price and 3 blockage factor discounts the adoption of sfas no 157 did not have an impact on nisource’s january 1 2008 balance of retained earnings and is not anticipated to have a material impact prospectively

environmental matters 

nisource affiliates have retained environmental liability including cleanup liability associated with some of its former operations including those of propane operations petroleum operations certain ldcs and cer more significant environmental liability relates to former mgp sites whereas less significant liability is associated with former petroleum operations and metering stations using mercurycontaining measuring equipment 

the ultimate liability in connection with the contamination at known sites will depend upon many factors including the extent of environmental response actions required the range of technologies that can be used for remediation other potentially responsible parties and their financial viability and indemnification from previous facility owners nisource’s environmental liability includes those corrective action costs considered “probable and reasonably estimable” under sfas no 5 and consistent with sop 961 nisource’s estimated remediation liability will be refined as events in the remediation process occur and actual remediation costs may differ materially from nisource’s estimates due to the dependence on the factors listed above 

proposals for voluntary initiatives and mandatory controls are being discussed both in the united states and worldwide to reduce socalled “greenhouse gases” such as carbon dioxide a byproduct of burning fossil fuels and methane a component of natural gas certain nisource affiliates engage in efforts to voluntarily report and reduce their greenhouse gas emissions nisource is currently a participant in the epa’s climate leaders program and will continue to monitor and participate in developments related to efforts to potentially regulate greenhouse gas emissions

operating segments are components of an enterprise for which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance the nisource chief executive officer is the chief operating decision maker 

nisource’s operations are divided into four primary business segments the gas distribution operations segment provides natural gas service and transportation for residential commercial and industrial customers in ohio pennsylvania virginia kentucky maryland indiana and massachusetts the gas transmission and storage operations segment offers gas transportation and storage services for ldcs marketers and industrial and commercial customers located in northeastern midatlantic midwestern and southern states and the district of columbia the electric operations segment provides electric service in 20 counties in the northern part of indiana the other operations segment primarily includes gas and power marketing and ventures focused on distributed power generation technologies including cogeneration facilities fuel cells and storage systems

competition 

gas distribution operations competes with investorowned municipal and cooperative electric utilities throughout its service area and to a lesser extent with other regulated natural gas utilities and propane and fuel oil suppliers gas distribution operations continues to be a strong competitor in the energy market as a result of strong customer preference for natural gas competition with providers of electricity is generally strongest in the residential and commercial markets of kentucky southern ohio central pennsylvania and western virginia where electric rates are primarily driven by lowcost coalfired generation in ohio and pennsylvania similar gas provider competition is also common gas competes with fuel oil and propane in the massachusetts market mainly due to the installed base of fuel oil and propanebased heating which over time has comprised a declining percentage of the overall market 

market conditions 

spot prices for the winter of 20082009 have been in the 535 — 710dth range this is a decrease when compared to the prices experienced during the winter of 20072008 that were in the 650 — 1000dth range this decrease can be attributed mainly to increasing supply and a decline in industrial demand that coincided with the economic slowdown that started in the middle of 2008 

entering the 20082009 winter season storage levels were comparable to the prior year and five year average inventory levels during the summer of 2008 prices ranged between 625 — 1325dth with the higher prices experienced early in the summer as storage players scrambled to refill storage that had been depleted by the cold finish to the 20072008 winter 

all nisource gas distribution operations companies have stateapproved recovery mechanisms that provide a means for full recovery of prudently incurred gas costs gas costs are treated as passthrough costs and have no impact on the net revenues recorded in the period the gas costs included in revenues are matched with the gas cost expense recorded in the period and the difference is recorded on the consolidated balance sheets as underrecovered or overrecovered gas cost to be included in future customer billings during times of unusually high gas prices throughput and net revenue have been adversely affected as customers may reduce their usage as a result of higher gas cost 

the gas distribution operations companies have pursued nontraditional revenue sources within the evolving natural gas marketplace these efforts include the sale of products and services upstream of the companies’ service territory the sale of products and services in the company’s service territories and gas supply cost incentive mechanisms for service to their core markets the upstream products are made up of transactions that occur between an individual gas distribution operations company and a buyer for the sales of unbundled or rebundled gas supply and capacity the onsystem services are offered by nisource to customers and include products such as the transportation and balancing of gas on the gas distribution operations company system the incentive mechanisms give the gas distribution operations companies an opportunity to share in the savings created from such things as gas purchase prices paid below an agreed upon benchmark and its ability to reduce pipeline capacity charges the treatment of the revenues generated from these types of transactions vary by operating company with some sharing the benefits with customers and others using these revenues to mitigate transition costs occurring as the result of customer choice programs gas distribution operations continues to offer choice opportunities where customers can choose to purchase gas from a third party supplier through regulatory initiatives in all of its jurisdictions

the gas distribution operations segment’s capital expenditures and other investing activities were 3697 million in 2008 and are projected to be approximately 3320 million in 2009 this reduction in the capital expenditure budget is mainly due to lower spending on infrastructure programs due to capital restraints brought about by the recent turmoil in the financial markets the increase in 2008 over 2007 was primarily due to higher expenditures in infrastructure replacement programs particularly in ohio and pennsylvania

on october 17 2007 bay state petitioned the dpu to allow the company to collect an additional 75 million in annual revenue related to usage reductions occurring since its last rate case bay state also requested approval of a steel infrastructure tracker that would allow for recovery of ongoing infrastructure replacement program investments the dpu held hearings on this matter in the first quarter of 2008 and issued an order denying bay state’s petition on april 30 2008 nisource has decided not to appeal this case and continues to weigh its options on july 16 2008 the dpu issued an order in its generic decoupling proceeding for gas utilities nisource has reviewed the generic order and considers the dpu’s action favorable 

on october 1 2008 columbia of maryland filed a base rate case with the maryland public service commission and on february 20 2009 columbia of maryland and all interested parties filed a unanimous settlement in the case recommending an annual revenue increase of 12 million in its initial filing columbia of maryland sought an increase of 37 million annually columbia of maryland anticipates approval of the settlement and implementation of new rates in the second quarter of 2009 

cost recovery and trackers a significant portion of the distribution companies’ revenue is related to the recovery of gas costs the review and recovery of which occurs via standard regulatory proceedings all states require periodic review of actual gas procurement activity to determine prudence and to permit the recovery of prudently incurred costs related to the supply of gas for customers nisource distribution companies have historically been found prudent in the procurement of gas supplies to serve customers 

item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

nisource inc gas distribution operations continued 

certain operating costs of the nisource distribution companies are significant recurring in nature and generally outside the control of the distribution companies some states allow the recovery of such costs via cost tracking mechanisms such tracking mechanisms allow for abbreviated regulatory proceedings in order for the distribution companies to implement charges and recover appropriate costs tracking mechanisms allow for more timely recovery of such costs as compared with more traditional cost recovery mechanisms examples of such mechanisms include gas cost recovery adjustment mechanisms tax riders and bad debt recovery mechanisms 

comparability of gas distribution operations line item operating results is impacted by these regulatory trackers that allow for the recovery in rates of certain costs such as bad debt expenses increases in the expenses that are the subject of trackers result in a corresponding increase in net revenues and therefore have essentially no impact on total operating income results 

certain of the nisource distribution companies are embarking upon plans to replace significant portions of their operating systems that are nearing the end of their useful lives those companies are currently evaluating requests for increases in rates in order to allow recovery of the additional capital expenditures required for such plans each ldc’s approach to cost recovery may be unique given the different laws regulations and precedent that exist in each jurisdiction 

on april 9 2008 the puco issued an order approving in all material respects a joint stipulation submitted on behalf of columbia of ohio this stipulation is a result of a process that began on april 13 2005 with a puco ordered investigation into the type of gas risers installed in the state the conditions of installation and overall performance the stipulation provides for establishment of accounting for and recovery of costs resulting from the staff’s investigation columbia of ohio’s performance of a survey to identify those customerowned risers on its system prone to failure and related customer education and other program related expenses in addition this stipulation provides for columbia of ohio’s assumption of financial responsibility for the replacement of all risers identified as prone to failure repair or replacement of hazardous customer owned service lines and capitalization of this investment with recovery to be addressed in future rate proceedings as of december 31 2008 columbia of ohio has approximately 506 million in costs associated with the gas riser and customer service line programs recorded as a regulatory asset andor capitalized plant 

on december 28 2007 columbia of ohio entered into a stipulation with the ohio consumers’ counsel and puco staff and other stakeholders resolving litigation concerning a pending gas cost recovery audit of columbia of ohio the stipulation calls for an accelerated pass back to customers of 366 million that will occur from january 31 2008 through january 31 2009 generated through offsystem sales and capacity release programs the development of new energy efficiency programs for introduction in 2009 and the development of a wholesale auction process for customer supply to take effect in 2010 approximately 302 million was passed back through december 31 2008 the stipulation also resolves issues related to pending and future gas cost recovery management performance audits through 2008 the puco approved this agreement on january 23 2008 

columbia of ohio and other stakeholders reached an agreement in the fourth quarter of 2007 that establishes the framework for operations under columbia of ohio’s choice ® program for the next several years and provides for a wholesale gas supply auction by early 2010 on january 23 2008 the puco approved the agreement the stipulation also included a commitment on behalf of columbia of ohio to file on or before february 1 2009 an application that proposes to implement by no later than april 1 2010 a wholesale auction procedure to secure the gas supply required to serve its sales customers columbia of ohio filed this application on january 30 2009 pursuant to that application columbia of ohio proposes to implement two consecutive one year long sso periods starting in april 2010 with the intent to obtain commodity supplies for both columbia of ohio’s pipp and the sso load columbia of ohio will obtain gas supplies from alternative suppliers and pass the price of that gas on to its sales customers at a monthly rate called the sso rate 

in july 2008 columbia of ohio filed an application with the puco for permission to create a new comprehensive energy conservation program if approved by the puco columbia of ohio’s dsm program would offer a wide range of services to residential and small commercial customers columbia of ohio proposes to recover the threeyear 249 million cost of the dsm conservation program through a rider that would be added to residential and small commercial customer bills beginning in may 2010 on july 23 2008 the puco issued an order approving

currently various environmental matters impact the gas distribution operations segment as of december 31 2008 reserves have been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions refer to note 19d “environmental matters” in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the gas distribution operations segment 

sale of northern utilities 

on december 1 2008 nisource completed its sale of northern utilities and granite state gas to unitil corporation for 2016 million including 416 million for working capital the working capital amount will be adjusted based upon the final settlement during the first quarter of 2009 northern utilities is a local gas distribution company serving 52 thousand customers in 44 communities in maine and new hampshire in the first quarter of 2008 nisource began accounting for the operations of northern utilities as discontinued operations as such net income of 62 million 53 million and 49 million from continuing operations for northern utilities which affected the gas distribution operations segment was classified as net income from discontinued operations for the years ended december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively refer to note 4 “discontinued operations and assets and liabilities held for sale” in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 

nisource acquired northern utilities and granite state gas in 1999 as part of the company’s larger acquisition of bay state nisource is retaining its ownership of bay state as a core component of the company’s longterm investmentdriven growth strategy 

weather 

in general nisource calculates the weather related revenue variance based on changing customer demand driven by weather variance from normal heating degreedays normal is evaluated using heating degree days across the nisource distribution region while the temperature base for measuring heating degreedays ie the estimated average daily temperature at which heating load begins varies slightly across the region the nisource composite measurement is based on 62 degrees 

weather in the gas distribution operations service territories for 2008 was approximately 2 colder than normal and 5 colder than 2007 increasing net revenues by approximately 9 million for the year ended december 31 2008 compared to 2007 

weather in the gas distribution operations service territories for 2007 was approximately 3 warmer than normal and 11 colder than 2006 increasing net revenues by approximately 71 million for the year ended december 31 2007 compared to 2006 

throughput 

total volumes sold and transported for the year ended december 31 2008 were 9232 mmdth compared to 9073 mmdth for 2007 this increase reflected higher sales to residential and commercial customers attributable mainly to cooler weather and higher offsystem sales 

total volumes sold and transported for the year ended december 31 2007 were 9073 mmdth compared to 8140 mmdth for 2006 this increase reflected higher sales to residential commercial and industrial customers which was attributable mainly to cooler weather an increase in residential and commercial customers and usage and higher offsystem sales 

net revenues 

net revenues for 2008 were 15376 million an increase of 620 million from 2007 this increase in net revenues was due primarily to regulatory and service programs including impacts from rate proceedings at columbia of pennsylvania columbia of ohio columbia of kentucky and bay state of 219 million the impact of an adjustment for estimated unbilled revenues of 146 million recorded by northern indiana in 2007 increased

nisource inc gas distribution operations continued 

trackers of 131 million offset in expense colder weather of approximately 9 million and increased residential usage of 40 million partially offset by reduced industrial and commercial margins and usage of 90 million the 219 million increase from regulatory and service programs is inclusive of a 93 million decrease in net revenues associated with the implementation of the columbia of ohio stipulation entered into with the ohio consumers counsel and the puco at the end of 2007 

net revenues for 2007 were 14756 million an increase of 939 million from 2006 this increase in net revenues was due primarily to the impact of colder weather amounting to approximately 71 million a 178 million increase in revenues from regulatory and tax trackers which are primarily offset in operating expense increased revenues from regulatory initiatives and other service programs of 109 million and approximately 8 million from customer growth these increases in net revenues were partially offset by an adjustment for estimated unbilled revenues of 146 million northern indiana detected an error in its unbilled revenue calculation and revised its estimate for unbilled electric and gas revenues in the fourth quarter of 2007 over a period of several years northern indiana used incorrect customer usage data to calculate its unbilled revenue the unbilled revenue estimates were never billed to customers and the error was corrected in the fourth quarter of 2007 

operating income 

for the twelve months ended december 31 2008 operating income for the gas distribution operations segment was 3349 million an increase of 99 million compared to the same period in 2007 primarily attributable to increased net revenues described above partially offset by higher operating expenses of 521 million the increase in operating expenses includes 131 million of expenses recoverable through regulatory and tax trackers which are offset in revenues of which 66 million is for an increase in tracked tax expense operating expenses also increased primarily due to higher employee and administrative costs of 213 million increased outside service and supplies expense of 53 million higher depreciation expense of 45 million and increased gross receipts and other operating taxes excluding the impact of trackers of 40 million employee and administrative costs increased as a result of higher payroll costs for increased headcount cost of living and performance adjustments and higher corporate services costs related to information technology and consulting 

for the twelve months ended december 31 2007 operating income for the gas distribution operations segment was 3250 million an increase of 416 million compared to the same period in 2006 primarily attributable to increased net revenues described above partially offset by higher operating expenses of 523 million the increase in operating expenses includes 178 million of expenses recoverable through regulatory and tax trackers that are primarily offset in revenues operating expenses also increased primarily due to higher employee and administrative costs of 267 million increased outside service expense of 52 million higher environmental reserves of 50 million and increased property taxes of 45 million the comparable period last year was impacted by transition expenses associated with the ibm agreement of 85 million partially offset by a reversal of a restructuring reserve for leased office space of 52 million the employee and administrative costs include payroll benefits and higher corporate services costs primarily related to the pricing structure under nisource’s original business services arrangement with ibm

hardy storage project 

hardy storage is in service receiving customer injections and withdrawing natural gas from its new underground natural gas storage facility in west virginia injections in 2008 allowed the field to deliver up to 150000 dth of natural gas per day during the 20082009 winter heating season customers withdrew over 544 bcf from the storage field during the 20072008 winter heating season when fully operational in 2009 the field will have a working storage capacity of 12 bcf and the ability to deliver 176000 dth of natural gas per day hardy storage is a joint venture of subsidiaries of columbia transmission and piedmont 

columbia transmission the operator of hardy storage has expanded its natural gas transmission system to provide the capacity needed to deliver hardy storage supplies to customer markets construction of these transmission facilities is complete and the facilities were placed into service during april 2007 

nisource energy partners lp 

on december 21 2007 nisource energy partners lp an mlp and subsidiary of nisource filed a form s1 registration statement with the sec in which it proposed making an initial public offering of common units in the mlp and nisource proposed contributing its interest in columbia gulf to the mlp nisource management believes the formation of an mlp will be a natural complement to nisource’s gas transmission and storage growth strategy and if further pursued could provide nisource access to competitively priced capital to support future growth investment the initial public offering did not occur in 2008 due to the damage sustained at columbia gulf’s hartsville tennessee compressor station following the tornado at the facility as well as overall financial market conditions nisource is in the process of withdrawing its registration statement with the sec due to market conditions and other internal and external factors 

florida gas transmission expansion project 

an open season to solicit interest and contracts for expanded capacity on columbia gulf’s system for delivery to florida gas transmission was held in late 2007 and contracts for 100000 dth per day of capacity were executed this project was placed into service in may 2008 

eastern market expansion project 

on january 14 2008 the ferc issued an order which granted a certificate to construct the project the project allows columbia transmission to expand its facilities to provide additional storage and transportation services and to replace certain existing facilities this eastern market expansion is projected to add 97000 dth per day of storage and transportation deliverability and is fully subscribed on a 15year contracted firm basis construction of the facilities is underway and the project is expected to be in service by april 2009 

appalachian expansion project 

on august 22 2008 the ferc issued an order to columbia transmission which granted a certificate to construct the project the project specifies building a new 9470 hp compressor station in west virginia the appalachian expansion project will add 100000 dth per day of transportation capacity and is fully subscribed on a 15year contracted firm basis construction is in progress and the project is expected to be in service by the second half of 2009 

ohio storage project 

on june 24 2008 columbia transmission filed an application before the ferc for approval to expand two of its ohio storage fields for additional capacity of nearly 7 bcf and 103400 dth per day of daily deliverability if required approvals are granted as requested construction would begin in 2009 and the expanded facilities would be placed in service by the middle of 2009 the expansion capacity is 58 contracted on a longterm firm basis

markwest energy partners lp joint venture project 

in august 2008 columbia transmission and markwest energy partners lp announced their intention to jointly develop several natural gas gathering and processing projects to support increased natural gas production in the appalachian basin the two companies are in discussions with several natural gas producers to provide new gathering and gas processing services in association with columbia transmission’s existing majorsville wv compressor station located in the northern panhandle area of west virginia and western pennsylvania 

columbia penn project 

in september 2008 columbia transmission announced its intention to develop additional natural gas transmission gathering and processing services along and around its existing pipeline corridor between waynesburg pa and renovo pa referred to as the “columbia penn” corridor this twophased development will accelerate access to pipeline capacity in conjunction with production increases in the marcellus shale formation which underlies columbia transmission’s transmission and storage network in the region phase i is anticipated to give customers access to capacity in early 2009 while phase ii would be available by the end of 2009 

capital expenditures and other investing activities 

the table below reflects actual capital expenditures and other investing activities by category for 2007 and 2008 and estimates for 2009 

 

the gas transmission and storage operations segment’s capital expenditure program and other investing activities are projected to be approximately 2902 million in 2009 the decrease in capital is due to a reduction in storage and transportation growth projects 

sales and percentage of physical capacity sold 

columbia transmission and columbia gulf compete for transportation customers based on the type of service a customer needs operating flexibility available capacity and price columbia gulf and columbia transmission provide a significant portion of total transportation services under firm contracts and derive a smaller portion of revenues through interruptible contracts with management seeking to maximize the portion of physical capacity sold under firm contracts 

firm service contracts require pipeline capacity to be reserved for a given customer between certain receipt and delivery points firm customers generally pay a “capacity reservation” fee based on the amount of capacity being reserved regardless of whether the capacity is used plus an incremental usage fee when the capacity is used annual capacity reservation revenues derived from firm service contracts generally remain constant over the life of the contract because the revenues are based upon capacity reserved and not whether the capacity is actually used the high percentage of revenue derived from capacity reservation fees mitigates the risk of revenue fluctuations within the gas transmission and storage operations segment due to changes in nearterm supply and demand conditions for the twelve months ended december 31 2008 approximately 901 of the transportation revenues were derived from capacity reservation fees paid under firm contracts and 53 of the transportation revenues were derived from usage fees under firm contracts this is compared to approximately 874 of the transportation revenues derived from capacity reservation fees paid under firm contracts and 49 of transportation revenues derived from usage fees under firm contracts for the twelve months ended december 31 2007 

interruptible transportation service is typically short term in nature and is generally used by customers that either do not need firm service or have been unable to contract for firm service these customers pay a usage fee only for the volume of gas actually transported the ability to provide this service is limited to available capacity not otherwise used by firm customers and customers receiving services under interruptible contracts are not assured capacity in the pipeline facilities gas transmission and storage operations provides interruptible service at competitive prices in order to capture short term market opportunities as they occur and interruptible service is viewed by management 

item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

nisource inc gas transmission and storage operations continued 

as an important strategy to optimize revenues from the gas transmission assets for the twelve months ended december 31 2008 and 2007 approximately 46 and 77 respectively of the transportation revenues were derived from interruptible contracts 

significant ferc developments 

on november 6 2008 the ferc issued an order approving a stipulation and consent agreement entered into by columbia transmission and columbia gulf collectively the columbia pipelines with the ferc’s office of enforcement the settlement resolves any and all matters related to a a preliminary nonpublic investigation commenced on january 25 2005 into the columbia pipelines’ provision of the pal investigation and b an outstanding audit by the ferc’s office of market oversight and investigations the predecessor of ferc’s office of enforcement commenced on september 30 2003 in docket no pa0316 and a subsequent preliminary nonpublic investigation related to the audit the columbia pipelines cooperated with the ferc’s investigations 

to resolve the docket no pa0316 audit the settlement provided for the columbia pipelines to pay a civil penalty of 10 million to the united states treasury to resolve the pal investigation columbia transmission disgorged profits in the fourth quarter of 2008 in the amount of 90 million to firm and interruptible gas transportation customers and to make several nonpublic compliance reports the columbia pipelines neither admitted nor denied the ferc’s office of enforcement’s allegations 

hartsville and delhi compressor stations 

on february 5 2008 tornados struck columbia gulf’s hartsville compressor station in macon county tennessee the damage to the facility forced columbia gulf to declare force majeure because no gas was flowing through this portion of the pipeline system while a facility assessment was being performed and the current contractual transportation agreements of 2156 bcf per day could not be met since that time columbia gulf has constructed both temporary and permanent facilities at hartsville on july 19 2008 the station completed the installation of temporary horsepower and restored capacity to flow up to 2156 bcf per day during the next 12 to 14 months the temporary facilities that were constructed to restore system capabilities will be replaced with a permanent solution 

nisource expects to incur an additional 302 million in reconstruction costs for the compressor station and ancillary facilities in addition to the 470 million in costs incurred in 2008 damage claims were settled with insurance companies in 2008 for a total of 775 million of which 301 million was received in the current year after a 10 million deductible amounts received were all attributable to capital repairs as of december 31 2008 columbia gulf had an insurance receivable of 474 million related to the damages which includes 17 million for business interruption and gas lost

throughput for the gas transmission and storage operations segment totaled 15218 mmdth for 2008 compared to 13905 mmdth in 2007 the increase of 1313 mmdth is due primarily to increased transportation deliveries on columbia transmission related to hardy storage field operations being in service for a full year as well as incremental throughput from new interconnects along the columbia gulf and columbia transmission pipeline systems columbia gulf in tandem with columbia transmission renewed several key longterm contracts during 2008 and remains fully subscribed on the mainline going north 

throughput for the gas transmission and storage operations segment totaled 13905 mmdth for 2007 compared to 11511 mmdth in 2006 the increase of 2394 mmdth is due primarily to transportation relating to strong market area storage injections higher transport usage by natural gas fired electric power generators enhanced market access through new pipeline interconnects and the addition of new natural gas supply attached to the system at perryville louisiana 

net revenues 

net revenues were 8653 million for 2008 a decrease of 21 million from 2007 the decrease in net revenues was mainly due to lower shorterterm transportation and storage services and commodity margin revenues of 240 million the impact of a regulatory settlement of 90 million and insurance proceeds from a business interruption claim that improved last year’s results by 26 million these decreases in net revenues were partially offset by increased subscriptions for firm transportation services of 231 million related to new interconnects along the columbia gulf pipeline system deliveries from the hardy storage field and incremental demand revenues on the columbia transmission system as well as from a 53 million impact from contract buyouts a 44 million increase in trackers that are offset in expense and insurance proceeds from business interruption claims of 21 million 

net revenues were 8674 million for 2007 an increase of 208 million from 2006 the increase in net revenues was mainly due to higher subscriptions for firm transportation services of 198 million and a 73 million increase in revenues from regulatory trackers which are offset in operating expense these increases in net revenues were partially offset by a decrease in shorterterm transportation services and storage optimization revenues of 59 million 

operating income 

operating income of 3697 million in 2008 increased 77 million from 2007 primarily due to a decrease in operating expenses of 69 million and higher equity earnings of 29 million partially offset by a decrease in net revenues described above operating expenses decreased as a result of 107 million in lower legal reserves the impact of a 72 million impairment charge recognized in the comparable 2007 period related to base gas at a storage field 31 million in lower insurance costs and 24 million of lower uncollectible accounts these decreases in operating expenses were partially offset by higher employee and administrative costs of 100 million an 83 million loss on the sale of certain offshore assets of columbia gulf and 44 million of increased tracked expenses that are offset in revenues employee and administrative costs increased as a result of higher corporate services costs related to information technology and consulting and increased payroll costs including cost of living and performance adjustments equity earnings increased by 29 million due to higher afudc earnings associated with millennium partially offset by increased interest expense associated with hardy storage 

operating income of 3620 million in 2007 increased 215 million from 2006 primarily due to the increase in net revenues described above and equity earnings in unconsolidated affiliates of 94 million for 2007 compared to a loss of 123 million in unconsolidated affiliates in the 2006 period partially offset by increased operating expenses of 210 million equity earnings in unconsolidated affiliates increased 217 million due to hardy storage being placed in service in april 2007 higher afudc earnings from millennium and the impact of millennium recording a reserve in 2006 related to vacated portions of the original project operating expenses increased primarily as a result of higher employee and administrative costs of 141 million a 72 million impairment charge related to base gas at a storage field and increased tracker expenses of 73 million which are offset by a corresponding increase in revenues the employee and administrative costs include payroll benefits and higher corporate services costs primarily related to nisource’s business services arrangement with ibm these increases in operation and

on october 24 2008 northern indiana issued two requests for proposals to secure additional new sources of electric power to meet the future needs of its residential commercial and industrial customers the first request seeks capacity and energy proposals for up to 300 mw of electricity to address northern indiana’s projected electricity supply needs during the 2011 to 2016 time period the second request seeks up to 300 mw of electricity generated from renewable sources andor dsm technologies to address northern indiana’s projected electricity supply needs beginning in 2011 

market conditions 

northern indiana’s mwh sales to steelrelated industries accounted for approximately 636 of the total industrial mwh sales for the twelve months ended december 31 2008 northern indiana’s industrial sales volumes and revenues showed a modest increase for the first half of 2008 as compared to 2007 declining approximately 20 in the second half of 2008 due to the dramatic changes in the world economy mid to late 2008 the us steel industry continues to adjust to changing market conditions predominant factors are ongoing industry consolidation fluctuating demand increased steelmaking capacity in china and india and manufacturing input costs not fully covariant to steel sales prices whereby integrated steel manufacturers face margin volatility in the fourth quarter of 2008 the industry responded to decreased steel demand by idling capacity throughout the world steel industry production levels are presently down over 50 from the production levels of early 2008 

capital expenditures and other investing activities 

the table below reflects actual capital expenditures and other investing activities by category for 2007 and 2008 and estimates for 2009 

 

the electric operations segment’s capital expenditure program and other investing activities are projected to be approximately 1753 million in 2009 the decrease in capital is mainly due to no currently forecasted expenditures for acquisition of incremental electric generation capacity the increase in capital expenditure in 2008 compared to 2007 was due to the purchase of sugar creek for 3297 million 

regulatory matters 

significant rate developments northern indiana filed a petition for new electric base rates and charges on june 27 2008 and filed its caseinchief on august 29 2008 the filing requested a twostep increase the first step request was for an increase of approximately 24 million the second step was for an additional increase of approximately 81 million to incorporate the return on and recovery of the sugar creek facility such increase was expected to become effective at the date of dispatch of sugar creek by miso on december 1 2008 northern indiana successfully dispatched sugar creek into miso simultaneous with the termination of its pjm commitment as a result a revised caseinchief was filed on december 19 2008 incorporating sugar creek and resulting in a traditional onestep case requesting an increase in base rates calculated to produce additional gross margin of 857 million annually evidentiary hearings on northern indiana’s direct case commenced on january 12 2009 and concluded on february 6 2009 several stakeholder groups have intervened in the case representing customer groups and various counties and towns within northern indiana’s electric service territory a field hearing allowing customers to individually participate will occur on march 3 2009 the oucc and intervenors are scheduled to file their casesinchief by april 17 2009 northern indiana is scheduled to file its rebuttal testimony in june 2009 and final hearings are planned to begin july 27 2009 if a settlement agreement is not reached and the full procedural schedule takes place it is anticipated that new rates would take effect in early 2010

in january 2002 northern indiana indefinitely shut down its mitchell station in the electric base rate case discussed above northern indiana provided testimony that it intends to retire the mitchell station demolish it and remediate the site to industrial condition subject to the ability to recover these costs 

during 2002 northern indiana settled certain regulatory matters related to an electric rate review on september 23 2002 the iurc issued an order adopting most aspects of the settlement the order approving the settlement provides that electric customers of northern indiana will receive bill credits of approximately 551 million each year the credits will continue at approximately the same annual level and per the same methodology until the iurc enters a base rate order that approves revised northern indiana electric rates the order included a rate moratorium that expired on july 31 2006 the order also provides that 60 of any future earnings beyond a specified earnings level will be retained by northern indiana the revenue credit is calculated based on electric usage therefore in times of high usage the credit may be more than 551 million credits amounting to 539 million 560 million and 509 million were recognized for electric customers for the years ended 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively 

miso as part of northern indiana’s participation in the miso transmission service and wholesale energy market certain administrative fees and nonfuel costs have been incurred iurc orders have been issued authorizing the deferral for consideration in a future rate case proceeding of the administrative fees and certain nonfuel related costs incurred after northern indiana’s rate moratorium which expired on july 31 2006 during 2008 nonfuel costs of 23 million were deferred in accordance with the aforementioned orders in addition administrative ferc and other fees of 66 million were deferred in total for 2008 and 2007 miso costs of 89 million and 99 million respectively were deferred in the base rate case filed in august 2008 northern indiana proposed recovery over a three year amortization period of the cumulative amount of charges that will have been deferred by the time a rate order is issued and a tracker for recovery of these charges on an ongoing basis 

on april 25 2006 the ferc issued an order on the miso’s transmission and energy markets tariff stating that miso had violated the tariff on several issues including not assessing revenue sufficiency guarantee charges on virtual bids and offers and for charging revenue sufficiency guarantee charges on imports the ferc ordered miso to perform a resettlement of these charges back to the start of the day 2 market the resettlement began in july 2007 and ended in january 2008 certain charge types included in the resettlement were originally considered to be nonfuel and were recorded as regulatory assets in accordance with previous iurc orders allowing deferral of certain nonfuel miso costs during the fourth quarter 2007 based on precedent set by an iurc ruling for another indiana utility northern indiana reclassified these charges totaling 167 million as fuel and included them in the fuel cost recovery mechanism in its latest fac filing prior to the hearing for fac78 on april 17 2008 several intervenors objected to a portion of the 167 million and northern indiana agreed to remove 76 million from the fac filing this amount represents the portion of the resettlement costs related to periods prior to december 9 2005 the 76 million was recorded as a reduction to net revenues in the first quarter of 2008 

on november 7 2008 the ferc issued an order regarding the clarification of a rate mismatch as it pertains to the rsg first pass calculation on november 10 2008 the ferc issued an order indicating that the rsg rates in effect were unjust and unreasonable based on a section 206 filing that northern indiana and ameren jointly filed on august 10 2007 miso determined that resettlements are required for all periods from market start to the section 206 refund effective date to remedy the rate mismatch the ferc ordered refunds with interest after august 10 2007 miso in its compliance filing indicated it will perform another resettlement to recalculate the rsg first pass distribution rate these resettlements will begin in the first quarter of 2009 and will conclude by the first quarter of 2010 as the result of these resettlements northern indiana will see a shift from rsg second pass which is a non fuel charge as determined from a previous iurc order to the rsg first pass distribution which is included as part of the fuel cost mechanism the interim rsg allocation is still subject to rehearing northern indiana does not expect a material impact on the financial statements 

northern indiana is an active stakeholder in the process used in designing testing and implementing the asm and in developing the surrounding business practices on january 18 2008 northern indiana as part of a joint petition among several other indiana utilities “joint petitioners” filed a request to the iurc to participate in asm and seek approval of timely cost recovery for the associated costs of participating on august 13 2008 the iurc issued a phase i order authorizing the joint petitioners authority to transfer additional balancing authority functions and to

implement the operational changes necessary to participate in the asm and to seek recovery of modified miso chargetypes via the fac and to defer certain other miso chargetypes pending a final determination on the issue of cost recovery this order also created a subdocket for the purpose of further consideration of whether a costbenefit analysis of participation in miso or the miso asm should be required phase ii of this proceeding deals with how the joint petitioners will approach the asm specifically related to operating reserves and the specifics regarding cost recovery the evidentiary hearing for phase ii concluded on february 9 2009 the market began on january 6 2009 at this time northern indiana is not yet able to determine what impact the asm will have on its operations or cash flows 

cost recovery and trackers a significant portion of the northern indiana’s revenue is related to the recovery of fuel costs to generate power and the fuel costs related to purchased power these costs are recovered through a fac a standard quarterly “summary” regulatory proceeding in indiana various interveners including the oucc have taken issue with costs included in northern indiana’s fac80 filed in the summer of 2008 and the iurc has granted a subdocket in this proceeding the intervening parties and northern indiana are discussing procedures to eliminate these concerns there is no procedural schedule established for this subdocket 

on may 30 2008 northern indiana purchased sugar creek for 3297 million this purchase was in response to northern indiana’s need to add approximately 1000 mw of new capacity the sugar creek facility is a ccgt located in west terre haute indiana and has a plant capacity rating of 535 mw sugar creek has transmission access to both the miso and pjm interconnection wholesale electricity markets in november 2008 an arrangement was reached to release northern indiana from its contractual commitment binding the sugar creek power plant to provide capacity to pjm interconnection’s reliability pricing model market effective december 1 2008 sugar creek was accepted as an internal designated network resource within the miso 

the iurc issued an order on may 28 2008 approving the purchase of sugar creek but denied northern indiana’s request for deferral of depreciation expense and carrying costs related to the plant beginning with the acquisition date on the basis that the facility would not be used and useful property under traditional regulation until the facility was operating inside of miso the order also denied northern indiana’s request for alternative regulatory treatment of the plant based on incomplete presentation of evidence but provided for the establishment of a subdocket to allow for the proper presentation and consideration of alternative regulatory treatment on june 6 2008 northern indiana filed its a verified petition for rehearing b request for establishment of a subdocket for presentation and consideration of an alternative regulatory plan and c motion for consolidation a single document in cause no 43396 the iurc established a subdocket for consideration of northern indiana’s alternative regulatory plan northern indiana’s caseinchief was filed with the iurc on september 26 2008 the iurc on february 18 2009 issued an order approving a settlement agreement filed in this proceeding allowing northern indiana to begin deferring carrying costs and depreciation on sugar creek effective on december 1 2008 at the agreed to carrying cost rate of 65 the terms of recovery of the deferral will be resolved in northern indiana’s current rate proceeding 

northern indiana included a commitment to using renewable energy in its irp filed in november 2007 and a subsequent filing was made with the iurc requesting approval for northern indiana to enter into power purchase agreements with subsidiaries of iberdrola renewables for windgenerated power from iowa and south dakota and requesting full recovery of all associated costs on july 24 2008 the iurc issued an order approving northern indiana’s proposed purchase power agreement with subsidiaries of iberdrola renewables the agreement provides northern indiana the opportunity to purchase 100 mw of wind power which began in early 2009 

as part of a settlement agreement which resolved issues surrounding purchased power costs northern indiana implemented a new “benchmarking standard” that became effective in october 2007 which defines the price above which purchased power costs must be absorbed by northern indiana and are not permitted to be passed on to ratepayers the benchmark is based upon the costs of power generated by a hypothetical natural gas fired units using gas purchased and delivered to northern indiana and a set sharing mechanism during the twelve months of 2008 the amount of purchased power costs exceeding the benchmark amounted to 111 million which was recognized as a net reduction of revenues the agreement also contemplated northern indiana adding generating capacity to its existing portfolio by providing for the benchmark to be adjusted as new capacity is added the

dispatch of sugar creek into miso on december 1 2008 triggered a change in the benchmark whereby the first 500 mw tier of the benchmark provision was eliminated 

on november 26 2002 northern indiana received approval from the iurc for an ect under the ect northern indiana is permitted to recover 1 afudc and a return on the capital investment expended by northern indiana to implement idem’s nox sip through an ecrm and 2 related operation and maintenance and depreciation expenses once the environmental facilities become operational through an eerm under the iurc’s november 26 2002 order northern indiana is permitted to submit filings on a semiannual basis for the ecrm and on an annual basis for the eerm in december 2006 northern indiana filed a petition with the iurc for appropriate cost treatment and recovery of emission control construction needed to address the phase i cair requirements of the indiana air pollution control board’s cair rules that became effective on february 25 2007 on july 3 2007 northern indiana received an iurc order issuing a cpcn for the cair and camr phase i compliance plan projects estimated to cost approximately 23 million northern indiana includes the cair and camr phase i compliance plan costs to be recovered in the semiannual and annual ecrm and annual eerm filing six months after construction costs begin on october 23 2008 northern indiana filed for approval of a revised cost estimate to meet the nox and so2 and mercury emissions environmental standards northern indiana anticipates a total capital investment of approximately 368 million this revised cost estimate was approved by the iurc on january 14 2009 on october 1 2008 the iurc approved ecr12 for capital expenditures net of accumulated depreciation of 2677 million northern indiana filed ecr13 and eer6 in february 2009 for net capital expenditures and expense of 2700 million and 187 million respectively in the electric base rate case northern indiana has proposed that the frequency of the eerm be changed from annual to semiannual simultaneous with the filing of the ecrm in addition northern indiana proposed that the eerm be used to pass through to ratepayers the cost of any emission allowance purchases and the proceeds of any emission allowance sales 

in its electric base rate case filed in august 2008 and also in the december 19 2008 revised filing northern indiana proposed a new tracker referred to as the reliability adjustment mechanism the case proposes recovery over a three year amortization period of the cumulative amount of charges that will have been deferred by the time a rate order is issued and a tracker for recovery of these charges on an ongoing basis this tracker is also intended to be used to recover purchased power energy and capacity costs and to share with ratepayers the proceeds of any offsystem sales and transmission revenues 

northern indiana is seeking to offer dsm and energy efficiency programs to its electric customers and accordingly in december 2008 filed a caseinchief requesting approval to implement a variety of dsm programs proposed programs include rebates for energy efficiency appliances and an airconditioning cycling program designed to reduce peak load the iurc is also reviewing a program that would allow customers to reduce their cost of electricity by agreeing to interrupt their service under some yet to be defined guidelines that would match rules established by miso

net revenues 

electric operations net revenues were 8059 million for 2008 a decrease of 57 million from 2007 this decrease was primarily a result of lower residential sales volumes and lower residential and commercial margins of 195 million lower wholesale transactions of 141 million the impact of cooler weather of approximately 12 million 114 million of higher miso related costs and 80 million of nonrecoverable purchased power these decreases in net revenues were partially offset by the impact of a 335 million settlement in third quarter of 2007 related to the cost of power purchased in 2006 and 2007 the impact of a 109 million adjustment for estimated unbilled electric revenues recorded in 2007 62 million in increased industrial net revenues and incremental revenues of 61 million from the new sugar creek facility 

electric operations net revenues were 8116 million for 2007 a decrease of 108 million from 2006 this decrease was primarily a result of a 335 million settlement related to the cost of power purchased in 2006 and 2007 a 109 million adjustment for estimated unbilled electric revenues lower industrial margins and usage of 118 million and higher revenue credits of 51 million due to the timing of the credits and 32 million of nonrecoverable purchase power incurred in the fourth quarter of 2007 as a result of the settlement discussed above under “regulatory matters” northern indiana detected an error in its unbilled revenue calculation and revised its estimate for unbilled electric and gas revenues in the fourth quarter of 2007 over a period of several years northern indiana used incorrect customer usage data to calculate its unbilled revenue the unbilled revenue estimates were never billed to customers and the error was corrected in the fourth quarter of 2007 these decreases in net revenues were partially offset by higher wholesale margins and volumes of 196 million favorable weather of approximately 17 million higher residential and commercial volumes attributable to usage and increased customers of 153 million and lower unrecoverable miso costs of 71 million 

operating income 

operating income for 2008 was 2192 million a decrease of 423 million from 2007 the decrease in operating income was due to increased operating expenses of 366 million and lower net revenues described above operating expenses increased primarily due to a 176 million increase in depreciation which includes an 83 million depreciation expense adjustment recorded during the second quarter of 2008 higher employee and administrative costs of 118 million higher electric generation and maintenance expenses of 75 million and 41 million of incremental costs associated with the sugar creek facility partially offset by lower property taxes of 39 million employee and administrative costs increased as a result of higher payroll costs for increased headcount and cost of living and performance adjustments the higher generation and maintenance expenses were primarily attributable to a planned turbine and boiler maintenance and a generator overhaul 

operating income for 2007 was 2615 million a decrease of 489 million from 2006 the decrease in operating income was due to increased operating expenses of 381 million and lower net revenues described above operating expenses increased primarily due to higher employee and administrative expense of 290 million higher electric generation expense of 96 million higher storm damage restoration costs amounting to 43 million and higher depreciation expense of 46 million partially offset by lower miso administrative expenses of 30 million the employee and administrative costs include payroll benefits and higher corporate services costs primarily related to nisource’s business services arrangement with ibm

business strategy nisource focuses its business strategy on its core rateregulated assetbased businesses with virtually 100 of its operating income generated from the rateregulated businesses with the nation’s fourth largest natural gas pipeline the largest natural gas distribution network east of the rocky mountains and one of the nation’s largest natural gas storage networks nisource operates throughout the energyintensive corridor that extends from the supply areas in the gulf coast through the consumption centers in the midwest midatlantic new england and northeast this corridor includes over 40 of the nation’s population and close to 50 of its natural gas consumption nisource continues to position its assets to meet the corridor’s growing energy needs 

financial and strategic review nisource’s senior management and board are continuing the strategic and financial review process initiated during 2006 to unlock the underlying value of the company’s asset base and position it for the future nisource expects to be in a position to communicate the results of this process early in 2007 

competition and changes in the regulatory environment the regulatory frameworks applicable to nisource’s operations at both the state and federal levels continue to evolve these changes have had and will continue to have an impact on nisource’s operations structure and profitability management continually seeks new ways to be more competitive and profitable in this changing environment including providing gas customers with increased choices for products and services 

natural gas competition open access to natural gas supplies over interstate pipelines and the deregulation of the commodity price of gas has led to tremendous change in the energy markets ldc customers and marketers began to purchase gas directly from producers and marketers and an open competitive market for gas supplies has emerged this separation or “unbundling” of the transportation and other services offered by pipelines and ldc’s allows customers to purchase the commodity independent of services provided by the pipelines and ldc’s the ldc’s continue to purchase gas and recover the associated costs from their customers nisource’s gas distribution operations’ subsidiaries are involved in programs that provide customers the opportunity to purchase their natural gas requirements from third parties and use the nisource gas distribution operations’ subsidiaries for transportation services

electric competition in december 1999 the ferc issued order 2000 a final rule addressing the formation and operation of regional transmission organizations the rule was intended to eliminate pricing inequities in the provisioning of wholesale transmission service in compliance with the rule northern indiana transferred functional control of its electric transmission assets to miso on october 1 2003 transmission service for northern indiana occurs under the miso open access transmission tariff on april 1 2005 miso implemented an electric energy market following approved ferc tariffs northern indiana currently sells all power from its plants into this market 

nisource’s other operations subsidiaries also experience competition for energy sales and related services from third party providers nisource meets these challenges through innovative programs aimed at providing energy products and services at competitive prices while also providing new services that are responsive to the evolving energy market and customer requirements

 item 1a risk factors 

nisource inc 

there are many factors that could have a material adverse effect on nisource’s operating results financial condition and cash flows new risks may emerge at any time and nisource cannot predict those risks or estimate the extent to which they may affect financial performance each of the risks described below could adversely impact the value of nisource’s securities 

nisource has substantial indebtedness which could adversely affect its financial condition 

nisource has a significant amount of indebtedness outstanding as a result of the acquisition of columbia nisource had total consolidated indebtedness of 64325 million outstanding as of december 31 2006 the substantial indebtedness could have important consequences to investors for example it could 

 

some of nisource’s debt obligations contain financial covenants related to debttocapital ratios and crossdefault provisions nisource’s failure to comply with any of these covenants could result in an event of default which if not cured or waived could result in the acceleration of outstanding debt obligations 

nisource’s costs of compliance with environmental laws are significant the costs of compliance with future environmental laws and the incurrence of environmental liabilities could impact cash flow and profitability 

nisource’s subsidiaries are subject to extensive federal state and local environmental requirements that among other things regulate air emissions water usage and discharges remediation and the management of chemicals hazardous waste and solid waste compliance with these legal requirements requires nisource to commit significant expenditures for installation of pollution control equipment remediation environmental monitoring emissions fees and permits at many of nisource’s facilities these expenditures are significant and nisource expects that they will continue to be significant in the future 

if nisource’s subsidiaries fail to comply with environmental laws and regulations or cause harm to the environment or persons even if caused by factors beyond nisource’s control that failure or harm may result in the assessment of civil or criminal penalties and damages against nisource and its subsidiaries in september 2004 the epa issued an nov to northern indiana alleging violations of the new source review provisions of the clean air act an adverse outcome in this matter could require capital expenditures beyond the epa requirements that cannot be determined at this time and could require payment of substantial penalties 

existing environmental laws and regulations may be revised and new laws and regulations seeking to protect the environment may be adopted or become applicable to nisource’s subsidiaries revised or additional laws and regulations could result in significant additional expense and operating restrictions on nisource’s facilities or increased compliance costs which may not be fully recoverable from customers and would therefore reduce net income the cost impact of any new or amended legislation would depend upon the specific requirements enacted and cannot be determined at this time 

item 1a risk factors continued 

nisource inc 

a significant portion of the gas and electricity nisource sells is used by residential and commercial customers for heating and air conditioning accordingly the operating results fluctuate depending on the weather and to a certain extent usage of gas or electricity 

energy sales are sensitive to variations in weather forecasts of energy sales are based on normal weather which represents a longterm historical average significant variations from normal weather could have and have had a material impact on energy sales additionally residential usage and to some degree commercial usage have shown to be sensitive to fluctuations in commodity costs for gas and electricity whereby usage declines with increased energy costs thus affecting nisource’s financial results 

nisource’s electric operations are subject to economic conditions in certain industries 

electric operations in northern indiana have been and may continue to be adversely affected by events in the steel and steel related industries in particular sales to large industrial customers in these industries have been impacted by economic downturns generally and may be affected by consolidation and globalization within such industries 

the majority of nisource’s net revenues are subject to economic regulation and are exposed to the impact of regulatory rate reviews and proceedings 

virtually all of nisource’s net revenues are subject to economic regulation at either the federal or state level as such the net revenues generated by those regulated companies are subject to regulatory review by the applicable federal or state authority these rate reviews determine the energy rates charged to customers and directly impact revenues as part of a settlement reached in other regulatory proceedings northern indiana has agreed to file an electric base rate case with the iurc on or before july 1 2008 the outcome for the rate case could have a material effect on nisource’s financial results 

nisource’s recent outsourcing initiative and service agreement with ibm may not achieve the level of savings that was originally anticipated additionally many associated changes in systems and personnel are being made increasing operational and control risk during transition which may have an impact on the business and its financial condition 

nisource’s original expectation of the 10year agreement with ibm was to deliver upwards of 530 million in gross savings in operating and capital costs this cost savings is dependent upon many factors and unanticipated changes in operations may cause actual cost savings to be substantially less than expected many functions have recently been transitioned to ibm and many new personnel have assumed responsibilities across these functions increasing the risk of operational delays potential errors and control failures which may have an impact on nisource and its financial condition 

as a part of this transformation many new information technology systems and process changes have an accelerated timeline for completion increasing the risk of operational delays potential errors and control failures which may have an impact on nisource and its financial condition in august 2006 nisource and ibm decided to delay further implementation of certain information technology systems due to difficulties encountered with the first wave of new system implementations this delay may decrease the level of projected operating cost savings while continuing to ensure stable operations nisource is currently engaged in an overall assessment of the outsourcing initiative primarily to focus on operational and transformational improvements and develop an integrated plan that enables nisource to achieve its business objectives going forward 

nisource’s whiting merchant energy project is operating at a loss 

nisource owns and operates a merchant energy facility whiting clean energy at bp’s whiting indiana refinery this facility uses natural gas to generate electricity for sale in the wholesale markets and to generate steam for industrial use by bp’s refinery in the fourth quarter of 2006 nisource reached a new definitive agreement with bp redefining the terms under which whiting clean energy will provide steam to bp the profitability of this facility will remain dependant upon the market prices for electricity and natural gas and regional load dispatch patterns the aftertax loss for whiting clean energy was approximately 409 million for 2006 and 215 million for 2005 in addition an amendment to the agreement with bp provides bp with an option valid for 180 days from the amendment’s effective date in december 2006 for bp to purchase the facility free of liens for 100 million

for the twelve months ended december 31 2006 nisource reported income from continuing operations before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle of 3135 million or 115 per basic share compared to 2841 million or 105 per basic share in 2005 

the increase in income from continuing operations before cumulative effect of changes in accounting principle was primarily due to the following factors 

 

these increases were partially offset by the following items 

 

these factors and other impacts to the financial results are discussed in more detail within the following discussions of “results of operations” and “results and discussion of segment operations” 

financial and strategic review nisource’s senior management and board are continuing the strategic and financial review process initiated during 2006 to unlock the underlying value of the company’s asset base and position it for the future nisource expects to be in a position to communicate the results of this process early in 2007 

fourpoint platform for growth nisource has established four key initiatives to build a platform for longterm sustainable growth commercial and regulatory initiatives commercial growth and expansion of the gas transmission and storage business financial management of the balance sheet and process and expense management 

commercial and regulatory initiatives 

whiting clean energy  on december 18 2006 whiting clean energy and bp executed amendment iv which materially amended the terms of the esa under which whiting clean energy provides steam to bp the agreement specifies a planned termination of the esa at the end of 2009 with options for bp to extend the term one additional year under renegotiated steam pricing whiting clean energy accrued 170 million in costs associated with contract termination terms under the agreement in addition amendment iv provides bp an option valid for 180 days from the amendment’s effective date for bp to purchase the facility free of liens for 100 million 

item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

nisource inc 

management believes it is unlikely that bp will exercise this option the carrying amount of the whiting clean energy facility is approximately 275 million 

under the new terms of the agreement whiting clean energy’s financial performance should improve beginning in 2007 the profitability of the whiting clean energy project will continue to be dependent on among other things prevailing prices in the energy markets and regional load dispatch patterns and the steam requirements for bp’s oil refinery 

customer conservation nisource remains focused on the effects of customer conservation and is taking steps to address this issue nisource is developing and pursuing a number of regulatory initiatives throughout its distribution markets to mitigate the impact of conservation and customer attrition either through broader rate proceedings or specific mechanisms such as rate design decoupling or other initiatives developed to moderate the impact of conservation 

rate developments nisource’s subsidiary columbia of virginia reached a comprehensive settlement agreement with its commercial and regulatory stakeholders on an innovative pbr plan the agreement which has been approved by the vscc and became effective january 1 2007 establishes a pbr for a fouryear period freezing columbia of virginia’s nongas rates at their current levels and setting up an earnings sharing mechanism and temporary rate credits during the pbr plan period and contains a commitment by columbia of virginia to expand its system to continue to meet growth needs 

on february 1 2007 columbia of kentucky filed a base rate case requesting an increase in rates of 126 million or approximately 8 included in the filing is a request for approval of an accelerated main replacement cost recovery mechanism in order to facilitate replacement of certain parts of columbia of kentucky’s natural gas distribution system also included are proposals to help offset the effects of recent usage declines and increased customer attrition hearings are expected to be held in the second quarter of 2007 with new rates expected to be in effect by the third quarter of 2007 

in mid 2006 northern indiana filed a petition which simplifies gas distribution rates stabilizes revenues and provides for energy efficiency funding northern indiana filed its detailed case in this proceeding in january 2007 based upon lengthy and detailed discussion with stakeholders all parties requested and the iurc has granted an expedited schedule in this proceeding northern indiana expects a final order in the cause in the second quarter of 2007 northern indiana’s proposal called rate simplification would provide funding for weatherization and other customer programs while also providing relief to the company for reduced customer usage 

refer to the “results and discussion of segment operations” for a complete discussion of regulatory matters 

commercial growth and expansion of the gas transmission and storage business 

sales of shorterterm transportation and storage services seasonal price fluctuations in the national energy market created opportunities for customers to utilize existing shorterterm transportation and storage tariff services provided by columbia transmission and columbia gulf a commercial team is in place focused on this effort to capitalize on market opportunities columbia transmission entered into contracts that represent revenues in excess of 45 million of shorterterm business for 2006 columbia transmission and columbia gulf plan to continue offering these shorterterm transportation and storage services customer requirements for these services will vary according to market conditions which include such factors as commodity price volatility geographic price differentials and the physical capacity and capabilities of the pipeline network 

hardy storage  columbia transmission and a subsidiary of piedmont reached an agreement to jointly develop a major new underground natural gas storage field to help meet increased market demand for natural gas in the eastern united states construction began in the first quarter of 2006 and hardy storage is expected to be placed in service in the second quarter of 2007

financial management of the balance sheet 

interest expense savings nisource refinanced 24 billion of longterm debt at lower rates during 2005 as a result interest expense net was 3874 million for the year ended december 31 2006 a decrease of 327 million compared to last year this improvement was partially offset by lower interest income and higher costs related to the sale of accounts receivable which both contributed to the 205 million change in other net 

credit ratings  during 2006 standard  poor’s moody’s investors service and fitch ratings all reaffirmed nisource’s investment grade credit ratings with a stable outlook 

process and expense management 

ibm agreement during the second quarter of 2005 nisource corporate services reached a definitive agreement with ibm under which ibm will provide a broad range of business transformation and outsourcing services to nisource nisource’s original expectation of the 10year agreement with ibm was to deliver upwards of 530 million in gross savings in operating and capital costs this cost savings is dependent upon many factors and unanticipated changes in operations may cause actual cost savings to be substantially less than expected many functions have recently been transitioned to ibm and many new personnel have assumed responsibilities across these functions increasing the risk of operational delays potential errors and control failures which may have an impact on nisource and its financial condition 

as a part of this transformation many new information technology systems and process changes have an accelerated timeline for completion increasing the risk of operational delays potential errors and control failures which may have an impact on nisource and its financial condition in august 2006 nisource and ibm decided to delay further implementation of certain information technology systems due to difficulties encountered with the first wave of new system implementations this delay may decrease the level of projected operating cost savings while continuing to ensure stable operations nisource is currently engaged in an overall assessment of the outsourcing initiative primarily to focus on operational and transformational improvements and develop an integrated plan that enables nisource to achieve its business objectives going forward 

insurance costs nisource renewed both its onshore and offshore property and casualty insurance programs in 2006 nisource sustained an increase in property insurance costs directly attributable to the increase in insurance premiums for offshore and onshore facilities located in or near the gulf of mexico casualty premiums remained relatively flat compared to the previous year such increases and restrictions in coverage for gulf of mexico windstorm exposures were driven by losses experienced by the insurance industry over the past few years resulting from hurricanes such as ivan katrina and rita 

ethics and controls nisource has always been committed to providing accurate and complete financial reporting as well as requiring a strong commitment to ethical behavior by its employees during 2006 nisource tested all significant controls across its financial processes and nisource’s management has concluded that the company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of the end of the period covered by this form 10k refer to “management’s report on internal control over financial reporting” included in item 9a nisource’s senior management takes an active role in the development of this form 10k and the monitoring of the company’s internal control structure and

results of operations 

the consolidated review information should be read taking into account the critical accounting policies applied by nisource and discussed in “other information” of this item 7 

income from continuing operations and net income for the twelve months ended december 31 2006 nisource reported income from continuing operations before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle of 3135 million or 115 per basic share compared to 2841 million or 105 per basic share in 2005 income from continuing operations before the cumulative change in accounting principle for the twelve months ended december 31 2004 was 4330 million or 164 per basic share 

including results from discontinued operations and the change in accounting principle nisource reported 2006 net income of 2822 million or 104 per basic share 2005 net income of 3065 million or 113 per basic share and 2004 net income of 4363 million or 165 per basic share 

comparability of line item operating results was impacted by regulatory trackers that allow for the recovery in rates of certain costs such as bad debt expenses therefore increases in these tracked operating expenses are offset by increases in net revenues and had essentially no impact on income from continuing operations an increase in operating expenses of 553 million for the 2006 year was offset by a corresponding increase to net revenues reflecting recovery of these tracked costs in the 2005 period an increase in operating expenses of 336 million for trackers was offset by a corresponding increase to net revenues reflecting recovery of these costs 

net revenues total consolidated net revenues gross revenues less cost of sales for the twelve months ended december 31 2006 were 31246 million a 220 million decrease compared with 2005 excluding the impact of 553 million of trackers discussed above net revenues decreased by 773 million the change was principally driven by unfavorable weather compared to the prior year which impacted gas distribution operations net revenues by approximately 89 million as nisource’s gas markets experienced 14 warmer weather compared to last year and decreased electric operations net revenues by approximately 21 million due to the northern indiana electric market experiencing a 24 cooler summer compared to the 2005 summer cooling season gas distribution operations net revenues were also significantly affected by decreased residential gas customer usage amounting to approximately 22 million in addition last year’s results benefited from a third party buyout of a bankruptcy claim relating to the rejection of a shipper’s long term contract which amounted to 89 million these decreases in net revenues were partially offset by increased sales of shorterterm transportation and storage services in gas transmission and storage operations amounting to 439 million electric operations net revenues increased by 273 million as a result of a reduction in unrecoverable miso costs included in costs of sales which included the impact of a favorable regulatory ruling on the recoverability of certain miso charges timing of customer credits proceeds from emission allowances strong industrial sales and customer growth 

total consolidated net revenues for the twelve months ended december 31 2005 were 31466 million a 991 million increase compared with 2004 excluding the impact of 336 million of trackers discussed above net revenues increased by 655 million favorable weather during 2005 as compared to 2004 increased net revenues approximately 24 million and 27 million for gas distribution operations and electric operations respectively net revenues also improved due to increased residential and commercial customers and increased overall customer usage within electric operations contributing approximately 244 million improved results from whiting clean energy of 176 million increased residential customers for gas distribution operations contributing approximately 8 million and 121 million recognized on the buyout of a large customer gas contract these increases in revenues were partially offset by a decline in customer usage within gas distribution operations of approximately 331 million lower gas transmission and storage operations revenues of 203 million attributable to the 2004 renegotiation of firm service contracts with major pipeline customers net of remarketing activities and increases in the cost of service for electric operations associated with miso amounting to 157 million

expenses operating expenses were 22323 million in 2006 a 381 million increase from 2005 excluding increases in expenses that are recovered through regulatory trackers and corresponding increases in net revenues see discussion above operating expenses decreased 172 million the decrease was primarily due to impacts in 2005 which included restructuring charges transition costs pension and other postretirement benefit charges and other costs associated with the ibm outsourcing initiative totaling 828 million a 109 million charge for obsolete software systems and a 109 million impairment charge related to goodwill at kokomo gas operating expense increases in 2006 included 181 million for certain legal matters a 17 million accrual in conjunction with the bp contract revision higher employee and administrative expenses of approximately 17 million transition and other restructuring charges associated with the ibm agreement of 123 million generation and maintenance costs of 93 million in electric operations and higher property insurance premiums of 87 million mainly for offshore and onshore facilities located in or near the gulf of mexico 

operating expenses of 21942 million for 2005 increased 2247 million over 2004 excluding increases in expenses that are recovered through regulatory trackers and corresponding increases in net revenues see discussion above operating expenses increased 1890 million operation and maintenance expense increased largely due to restructuring charges including a pension and other postretirement benefit charge transition costs and consulting fees related to the outsourcing initiative and service agreement with ibm which totaled 828 million and higher electric generation expenses of 72 million depreciation expense increased approximately 30 million as a result of the expiration in november 2004 of the prior columbia of ohio regulatory stipulation that allowed for deferral of certain depreciation amounts the 2004 period benefited from a reduction in estimated property tax accruals amounting to 330 million while gross receipts tax increased 160 million in 2005 which is offset in revenue in addition goodwill associated with kokomo gas was impaired by 109 million and certain software systems were impaired totaling 109 million due to the outsourcing initiative and service agreement with ibm 

equity earnings loss in unconsolidated affiliates equity earnings loss in unconsolidated affiliates reduced 2006 income 123 million compared to earnings of 02 million in 2005 equity earnings loss in unconsolidated affiliates include investments in millennium and hardy storage which are integral to the gas transmission and storage operations business in december 2006 millennium received ferc approval for a pipeline project the certificate order approved certain project costs related to the construction and development of the millennium project the order also approved the vacating of portions of the original september 2002 millennium certificate that related to other facilities the millennium owners no longer believe the recovery of the capitalized costs related to the vacated portions of the project is probable therefore millennium has fully reserved the capitalized costs related to the development of the vacated portions nisource recorded a 13 million charge reflecting its share of millennium’s reserve during the fourth quarter of 2006 

other income deductions other income deductions in 2006 reduced income 3957 million compared to a reduction of 5189 million in 2005 a loss on early extinguishment of longterm debt of 1086 million during 2005 and decreased interest expense of 327 million in 2006 compared to 2005 due to the refinancing of 24 billion in longterm debt at lower rates during 2005 drove the decrease in other deductions other net was a loss of 65 million for 2006 compared to income of 140 million for the comparable 2005 period due to lower interest income and increased costs associated with the sale of accounts receivable higher fees due to higher interest rates and increased levels of accounts receivable balances resulted in the higher expenses associated with the sale of accounts receivable 

other income deductions in 2005 reduced income 5189 million compared to a reduction of 4023 million in 2004 a loss on early extinguishment of longterm debt of 1086 million recognized in 2005 drove the increased expense interest expense net increased 19 million from 2004 primarily due to the impact of higher shortterm interest rates on variable rate debt and higher average longterm debt balances due to the prefunding of november 2005 debt maturities 

income taxes income taxes increased 212 million in 2006 as compared with 2005 primarily due to higher pretax income from the prior year income taxes decreased 931 million in 2005 from 2004 primarily due to lower pretax income from

nisource inc 

the prior year the effective income tax rates were 353 345 and 359 in 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively the overall effective tax rate increase in 2006 versus 2005 was due to favorable state and federal income tax adjustments recorded in 2005 discussed below and a reduction in the electric production deduction and low income housing credits from those recorded in 2005 the increase was partially offset by a lower effective state income tax rate in 2006 due to a reduction in deferred state income tax liabilities it is expected that state income tax expense will return to more historic levels in 2007 

the 14 decrease in the effective tax rate from 2004 to 2005 is due to the impact of the tax benefit associated with the electric production deduction discussed below an adjustment to deferred taxes at northern indiana related to a reduction in deferred income tax requirements and a reduction in deferred state income tax liabilities resulting from a revised estimate of consolidated state income tax apportionment factors offsetting these reductions is an increase in the effective tax rate associated with the nondeductible goodwill impairment charge recorded at kokomo gas and increased taxes related to ohio income tax law changes enacted on june 30 2005

beginning in 2007 capital expenditures and other investing activities are expected to increase due to age and condition replacement programs and an increase in growth projects see discussion below capital expenditures are expected to be funded via a combination of cash flow from operations and new longterm debt issuances 

operating activities net cash from operating activities for the twelve months ended december 31 2006 was 11562 million an increase of 4439 million from a year ago this increase was primarily due to a significant reduction in outstanding accounts receivable and the collection of underrecovered gas cost partially offset by the impact in 2006 of reduced accounts payable balances high gas cost in december 2005 resulted in unusually large balances in accounts receivable accounts payable and underrecovered gas cost 

pension and other postretirement plan funding in 2007 nisource expects to make contributions of approximately 504 million to its pension plans and approximately 523 million to its postretirement medical and life plans 

investing activities

for 2006 capital expenditures and certain other investing activities were 6484 million an increase of 494 million over 2005 this increase was primarily due to incremental pipeline expenditures at the gas transmission and storage operations segment including pipeline integrity costs to comply with the dot’s integrity management rule as well as increased expenditures to update electric generation assets 

the gas distribution operations segment’s capital program in 2006 included new business initiatives to extend service to new areas and develop future markets through new services that may be added to the existing business and to create a potential new pool of customers as well as expenditures to ensure safe reliable and improved service to customers and modernize and upgrade facilities the gas transmission and storage operations segment invested primarily in modernizing and upgrading facilities including investments to comply with dot’s integrity management rule the gas transmission and storage operations segment also invested in new business initiatives to maintain and expand market share in storage and interstate transportation by meeting the demands of consumers who will use gas for electric power generation and meeting the needs of existing new or growing customers through the construction of significant new facilities either whollyowned by nisource or in partnership with other qualified project participants the electric operations segment capital program included improvements related to the operational integrity of generation transmission and distribution assets expenditures related to environmental compliance regarding nox reduction and additions to electric distribution systems related to new business capital expenditures in the other operations segment mainly comprise partnership investments and enterprisewide information technology infrastructure improvement 

for 2007 the projected capital program and certain other investing activities are expected to be 8011 million which is approximately 1527 million higher than the 2006 level this higher spending is mainly due to expenditures to overhaul certain electric generation units within the electric operations segment modernizing and upgrading facilities at certain distribution companies and an increase in expenditures for key market area growth projects primarily within gas transmission and storage operations the program is expected to be funded via a combination of cash flow from operations and new longterm debt issuances during 2007

various analytical techniques are employed to measure and monitor nisource’s market and credit risks including var var represents the potential loss or gain for an instrument or portfolio from changes in market factors for a specified time period and at a specified confidence level 

commodity price risk nisource is exposed to commodity price risk as a result of its subsidiaries’ operations involving natural gas and power to manage this market risk nisource’s subsidiaries use derivatives including commodity futures contracts swaps and options nisource is not involved in speculative energy trading activity 

commodity price risk resulting from derivative activities at nisource’s rateregulated subsidiaries is limited since regulations allow recovery of prudently incurred purchased power fuel and gas costs through the ratemaking process including gains or losses on these derivative instruments if states should explore additional regulatory reform these subsidiaries may begin providing services without the benefit of the traditional ratemaking process and may be more exposed to commodity price risk some of nisource’s rateregulated utility subsidiaries offer commodity price risk products to its customers for which derivatives are used to hedge forecasted customer usage under such products these subsidiaries do not have regulatory recovery orders for these products and are subject to gains and losses recognized in earnings due to hedge ineffectiveness 

tpc on behalf of whiting clean energy enters into power and gas derivative contracts to manage commodity price risk associated with operating whiting clean energy these derivative contracts do not always receive hedge accounting treatment under sfas no 133 and variances in earnings could be recognized as a result of marking these derivatives to market 

during 2006 and 2005 a gain of 01 million and 04 million net of taxes respectively were recognized in earnings due to the ineffectiveness of derivative instruments being accounted for as hedges no amounts were recognized in earnings in 2006 and 04 million was recognized in earnings in 2005 due to losses on derivatives classified as trading it is anticipated that during the next twelve months the expiration and settlement of cash flow hedge contracts will result in income statement recognition of amounts currently classified in accumulated other comprehensive income of approximately 546 million net of taxes refer to note 8 “risk management and energy trading activities” in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information on nisource’s various derivative programs for managing commodity price risk 

interest rate risk nisource is exposed to interest rate risk as a result of changes in interest rates on borrowings under revolving credit agreements variable rate pollution control bonds and floating rate notes which have interest rates that are indexed to shortterm market interest rates nisource is also exposed to interest rate risk due to changes in interest rates on fixedtovariable interest rate swaps that hedge the fair value of longterm debt based upon average borrowings and debt obligations subject to fluctuations in shortterm market interest rates an increase in shortterm interest rates of 100 basis points 1 would have increased interest expense by 253 million and 201 million for the years 2006 and 2005 respectively 

contemporaneously with the pricing of the 525 and 545 notes issued september 16 2005 nisource finance settled 900 million of forward starting interest rate swap agreements with six counterparties nisource paid an aggregate settlement payment of 355 million which is being amortized as an increase to interest expense over the term of the underlying debt resulting in an effective interest rate of 567 and 588 respectively 

nisource has entered into interest rate swap agreements to modify the interest rate characteristics of its outstanding longterm debt from fixed to variable on may 12 2004 nisource finance entered into fixedtovariable interest rate swap agreements in a notional amount of 660 million with six counterparties having a 6 12year term nisource finance will receive payments based upon a fixed 7875 interest rate and pay a floating interest amount based on us 6month bba libor plus an average of 308 per annum there was no exchange of premium at the initial date of the swaps in addition each party has the right to cancel the swaps on may 15 2009 

on july 22 2003 nisource finance entered into fixedtovariable interest rate swap agreements in a notional amount of 500 million with four counterparties with an 11year term nisource finance will receive payments based upon a fixed 540 interest rate and pay a floating interest amount based on us 6month bba libor plus

an average of 078 per annum there was no exchange of premium at the initial date of the swaps in addition each party has the right to cancel the swaps on either july 15 2008 or july 15 2013 

as a result of these fixedtovariable interest rate swap transactions 1160 million of nisource finance’s existing longterm debt is now subject to fluctuations in interest rates 

credit risk due to the nature of the industry credit risk is a factor in many of nisource’s business activities nisource’s extension of credit is governed by a corporate credit risk policy written guidelines approved by nisource’s risk management committee document the management approval levels for credit limits evaluation of creditworthiness and credit risk mitigation procedures exposures to credit risks are monitored by the corporate credit risk function which is independent of all commercial operations credit risk arises because of the possibility that a customer supplier or counterparty will not be able or willing to fulfill its obligations on a transaction on or before the settlement date for derivative contracts such as interest rate swaps credit risk arises when counterparties are obligated to pay nisource the positive fair value or receivable resulting from the execution of contract terms exposure to credit risk is measured in terms of both current obligations and the market value of forward positions current credit exposure is generally measured by the notional or principal value of obligations and direct credit substitutes such as commitments standby letters of credit and guarantees in determining exposure nisource considers collateral that it holds to reduce individual counterparty credit risk 

market risk measurement market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices rates indices volatilities correlations or other market factors such as liquidity will result in losses for a specified position or portfolio nisource calculates a oneday var at a 95 confidence level for the power trading group and the gas marketing group that utilize a variancecovariance methodology based on the results of the var analysis the daily market exposure for power trading on an average high and low basis was zero during 2006 the daily market exposure for the gas marketing and trading portfolios on an average high and low basis was 02 million 09 million and zero during 2006 respectively prospectively management has set the var limit at 08 million for gas marketing exceeding this limit would result in management actions to reduce portfolio risk the var limit for power trading was reduced to zero in the third quarter of 2005 with the settlement of all power trading contracts outstanding at that time power and gas derivative contracts entered into to manage price risk associated with whiting clean energy are limited to quantities surrounding the physical generation capacity of whiting clean energy and the gas requirements to operate the facility

other information 

critical accounting policies nisource applies certain accounting policies based on the accounting requirements discussed below that have had and may continue to have significant impacts on nisource’s results of operations and consolidated balance sheets 

basis of accounting for rateregulated subsidiaries sfas no 71 provides that rateregulated subsidiaries account for and report assets and liabilities consistent with the economic effect of the way in which regulators establish rates if the rates established are designed to recover the costs of providing the regulated service and if the competitive environment makes it probable that such rates can be charged and collected nisource’s rateregulated subsidiaries follow the accounting and reporting requirements of sfas no 71 certain expenses and credits subject to utility regulation or rate determination normally reflected in income are deferred on the consolidated balance sheets and are recognized in income as the related amounts are included in service rates and recovered from or refunded to customers the total amounts of regulatory assets and liabilities reflected on the consolidated balance 

item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

nisource inc 

sheets were 15633 million and 15510 million at december 31 2006 and 12031 million and 13861 million at december 31 2005 respectively for additional information refer to note 1f “basis of accounting for rateregulated subsidiaries” in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

in the event that regulation significantly changes the opportunity for nisource to recover its costs in the future all or a portion of nisource’s regulated operations may no longer meet the criteria for the application of sfas no 71 in such event a writedown of all or a portion of nisource’s existing regulatory assets and liabilities could result if transition cost recovery is approved by the appropriate regulatory bodies that would meet the requirements under generally accepted accounting principles for continued accounting as regulatory assets and liabilities during such recovery period the regulatory assets and liabilities would be reported at the recoverable amounts if unable to continue to apply the provisions of sfas no 71 nisource would be required to apply the provisions of sfas no 101 in management’s opinion nisource’s regulated subsidiaries will be subject to sfas no 71 for the foreseeable future 

certain of the regulatory assets reflected on nisource’s consolidated balance sheets require specific regulatory action in order to be included in future service rates although recovery of these amounts is not guaranteed nisource believes that these costs meet the requirements for deferral as regulatory assets under sfas no 71 regulatory assets requiring specific regulatory action amounted to 683 million at december 31 2006 if nisource determined that the amounts included as regulatory assets were not recoverable a charge to income would immediately be required to the extent of the unrecoverable amounts 

accounting for risk management activities under sfas no 133 the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and resulting designation unrealized and realized gains and losses are recognized each period as components of accumulated other comprehensive income earnings or regulatory assets and liabilities depending on the nature of such derivatives for subsidiaries that utilize derivatives for cash flow hedges the effective portions of the gains and losses are recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income and are recognized in earnings concurrent with the disposition of the hedged risks for fair value hedges the gains and losses are recorded in earnings each period along with the change in the fair value of the hedged item as a result of the ratemaking process the rateregulated subsidiaries generally record gains and losses as regulatory liabilities or assets and recognize such gains or losses in earnings when both the contracts settle and the physical commodity flows these gains and losses recognized in earnings are then subsequently recovered in revenues through rates 

in order for a derivative contract to be designated as a hedge the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item or transaction must be highly effective the effectiveness test is performed at the inception of the hedge and each reporting period thereafter throughout the period that the hedge is designated any amounts determined to be ineffective are recorded currently in earnings 

although nisource applies some judgment in the assessment of hedge effectiveness to designate certain derivatives as hedges the nature of the contracts used to hedge the underlying risks is such that there is a high risk correlation of the changes in fair values of the derivatives and the underlying risks nisource generally uses nymex exchangetraded natural gas futures and options contracts and overthecounter swaps based on published indices to hedge the risks underlying its naturalgasrelated businesses nisource had 2876 million and 3760 million of price risk management assets of which 2864 million and 3381 million related to hedges at december 31 2006 and 2005 respectively and 2976 million and 945 million of price risk management liabilities of which 2353 million and 856 million related to hedges at december 31 2006 and 2005 respectively the amount of unrealized gains recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income net of taxes was 314 million and 1507 million at december 31 2006 and 2005 respectively 

pensions and postretirement benefits nisource has defined benefit plans for both pensions and other postretirement benefits the plans are accounted for under sfas no 87 sfas no 88 and sfas no 106 as amended by sfas no 158 the calculation of the net obligations and annual expense related to the plans requires a significant degree of judgment regarding the discount rates to be used in bringing the liabilities to present value longterm returns on plan assets and employee longevity among other assumptions due to the size of the plans and the longterm nature of the associated liabilities changes in the assumptions used in the actuarial estimates could have material impacts on the measurement of the net obligations and annual expense recognition for further

goodwill impairment testing  as of december 31 2006 nisource had 37 billion of goodwill on the consolidated balance sheet which was mainly due to the acquisition of columbia nisource performs its annual impairment test of goodwill in accordance with sfas no 142 in june for the purpose of testing for impairment the goodwill recorded in the acquisition of columbia the related subsidiaries were aggregated into two distinct reporting units one within the gas distribution operations segment and one within the gas transmission and storage operations segment nisource uses the discounted cash flow method to estimate the fair value of its reporting units for the purpose of this test refer to notes 1j and 5 “goodwill and intangible assets” in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 

longlived asset impairment testing nisource’s consolidated balance sheets contains longlived assets other than goodwill and intangible assets which are not subject to recovery under sfas no 71 as a result nisource assesses the carrying amount and potential earnings of these assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value could be impaired as per sfas no 144 when an asset’s carrying value exceeds the undiscounted estimated future cash flows associated with the asset the asset is considered impaired to the extent that the asset’s fair value is less than its carrying value refer to note 1k “longlived assets” in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 

contingencies a contingent liability is recognized when it is probable that an environmental tax legal or other liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can reasonably be estimated accounting for contingencies require significant management judgment regarding the estimated probabilities and ranges of exposure to a potential liability estimates of the loss and associated probability are made based on the current facts available present laws and regulations and third party consultation management’s assessment of the contingent liability could change as a result of future events or as more information becomes available actual amounts could differ from estimates and can have a material impact on nisource’s results of operations and financial position refer to note 18 “other commitments and contingencies” in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 

asset retirement obligations nisource accounts for retirement obligations under the provisions of sfas no 143 as amended by fin 47 which require entities to record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred in the absence of quoted market prices fair value of asset retirement obligations are estimated using present value techniques using various assumptions including estimates of the amounts and timing of future cash flows associated with retirement activities inflation rates and creditadjusted risk free rates when the liability is initially recorded the entity capitalizes the cost thereby increasing the carrying amount of the related longlived asset over time the liability is accreted and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset the rateregulated subsidiaries defer the difference between the amount recognized for depreciation and accretion and the amount collected in rates as required pursuant to sfas no 71 for those amounts it has collected in rates or expects to collect in future rates refer to note 6 “asset retirement obligations” in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information

sab no 108 — considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements in september 2006 the sec issued sab no 108 to provide guidance on how prior year misstatements should be considered when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements sab no 108 became effective for periods ending after november 15 2006 there were no impacts to nisource’s consolidated financial statements as a result of the adoption of sab no 108 

sfas no 123 revised 2004 — sharebased payment effective january 1 2006 nisource adopted sfas no 123r using the modified prospective transition method sfas no 123r requires measurement of compensation cost for all stockbased awards at fair value on the date of grant and recognition of compensation over the service period for awards expected to vest in accordance with the modified prospective transition method nisource’s consolidated financial statements for prior periods have not been restated to reflect and do not include the impact of sfas no 123r prior to the adoption of sfas no 123r nisource applied the intrinsic value method of apb no 25 for awards granted under its stockbased compensation plans and complied with the disclosure requirements of sfas no 123 there were no modifications to awards as a result of the adoption of sfas 123r 

when it adopted sfas no 123r in the first quarter of 2006 nisource recognized a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle of 04 million net of income taxes which reflected the net cumulative impact of estimating future forfeitures in the determination of period expense rather than recording forfeitures when they occur as previously permitted other than the requirement for expensing stock options outstanding sharebased awards will continue to be accounted for substantially as they are currently as of december 31 2006 the total remaining unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested awards amounted to 51 million which will be amortized over the weightedaverage remaining requisite service period of 26 years

fin 48 — accounting for uncertainty in income taxes in june 2006 the fasb issued fin 48 to reduce the diversity in practice associated with certain aspects of the recognition and measurement requirements related to accounting for income taxes specifically this interpretation requires that a tax position meet a “morelikelythannot recognition threshold” for the benefit of an uncertain tax position to be recognized in the financial statements and requires that benefit to be measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement when determining whether a tax position meets this 50 threshold it is to be based on whether it is probable of being sustained on audit by the appropriate taxing authorities based solely on the technical merits of the position this interpretation is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2006 nisource will adopt the provisions of fin 48 in the first quarter of 2007 nisource is currently reviewing the provisions of this interpretation to determine the impact it may have on its consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements 

environmental matters nisource affiliates have retained environmental liability including cleanup liability associated with some of its former operations including those of propane operations petroleum operations certain ldcs and cer more significant environmental liability relates to former mgp sites whereas less significant liability is associated with former petroleum operations and metering stations using mercurycontaining measuring equipment 

the ultimate liability in connection with the contamination at known sites will depend upon many factors including the extent of environmental response actions required the range of technologies that can be used for remediation other potentially responsible parties and their financial viability and indemnification from previous facility owners nisource’s environmental liability includes those corrective action costs considered “probable and reasonably estimable” under sfas no 5 and consistent with sop 961 nisource’s estimated remediation liability will be refined as events in the remediation process occur and actual remediation costs may differ materially from nisource’s estimates due to the dependence on the factors listed above 

proposals for voluntary initiatives and mandatory controls are being discussed both in the united states and worldwide to reduce socalled “greenhouse gases” such as carbon dioxide a byproduct of burning fossil fuels and methane a component of natural gas certain nisource affiliates engage in efforts to voluntarily report and reduce their greenhouse gas emissions nisource is currently a participant in the epa’s climate leaders program and will continue to monitor and participate in developments related to efforts to register and potentially regulate greenhouse gas emissions

competition gas distribution operations compete with investorowned municipal and cooperative electric utilities throughout its service area and to a lesser extent with other regulated natural gas utilities and propane and fuel oil suppliers gas distribution operations continues to be a strong competitor in the energy market as a result of strong customer preference for natural gas competition with providers of electricity is generally strongest in the residential and commercial markets of kentucky southern ohio central pennsylvania and western virginia where electric rates are primarily driven by lowcost coalfired generation in ohio and pennsylvania gas on gas competition is also common gas competes with fuel oil and propane in the new england markets mainly due to the installed base of fuel oil and propanebased heating which over time has comprised a declining percentage of the overall market 

market conditions spot prices for the winter of 20062007 were primarily in the range of 500  800dth this was a significant decrease from the prices experienced during the winter of 20052006 that were in the 6001500dth range as a result of hurricane related production outages in the gulf of mexico supply disruptions associated with the 2005 hurricanes were restored by the third quarter of 2006 

entering the 20062007 winter season storage levels were at record high levels unseasonably mild weather for the months of november and december 2006 left national storage levels well above the prior five year average during the summer of 2006 prices ranged between 400 and 900dth however gas storage reached above the prior fiveyear average through december 2006 the winter of 20062007 price levels were primarily between 600 and 800dth 

all nisource gas distribution operations companies have stateapproved recovery mechanisms that provide a means for full recovery of prudently incurred gas costs gas costs are treated as passthrough costs and have no impact on the net revenues recorded in the period the gas costs included in revenues are matched with the gas cost expense recorded in the period and the difference is recorded on the consolidated balance sheets to be included in future customer billings during times of unusually high gas prices throughput and net revenue have been adversely affected as customers may reduce their usage as a result of higher gas cost 

the gas distribution operations companies have pursued nontraditional revenue sources within the evolving natural gas marketplace these efforts include both the sale of products and services upstream of their service territory the sale of products and services in their service territories and gas supply cost incentive mechanisms for service to their core markets the upstream products are made up of transactions that occur between an individual gas distribution operations company and a buyer for the sales of unbundled or rebundled gas supply and capacity the onsystem services are offered by nisource to customers and include products such as the transportation and balancing of gas on the gas distribution operations company system the incentive mechanisms give the gas distribution operations companies an opportunity to share in the savings created from such things as gas purchase prices paid below an agreed upon benchmark and its ability to reduce pipeline capacity charges the treatment of the revenues generated from these types of transactions vary by operating company with some sharing the benefits with customers and others using these revenues to mitigate transition costs occurring as the result of customer choice programs described below under “regulatory matters” 

capital expenditures and other investing activities the gas distribution operations segment’s net capital expenditures and other investing activities were 2834 million in 2006 and are projected to be approximately 3334 million in 2007 this increase in the capital expenditure budget is mainly due to an expected increase in expenditures for modernizing and upgrading facilities as well as the implementation of a standardized work management system at certain distribution companies as part of a multiyear plan

on january 31 2006 the iurc approved a joint stipulation and settlement agreement between northern indiana and other parties resolving all terms of a new gas arp program the new arp is effective may 1 2006 through april 30 2010 the new arp continues key products and services including northern indiana’s choice program for customers the arp also continues the gcim and adds a new incentive mechanism that shares savings of reduced transportation costs between the company and customers northern indiana and the settling parties also agreed to a moratorium on base rates with the ability to address certain defined issues during the term of this agreement 

in mid 2006 northern indiana filed a petition which simplifies gas distribution rates stabilizes revenues and provides for energy efficiency funding northern indiana filed its detailed case in this proceeding in january 2007 based upon lengthy and detailed discussion with stakeholders all parties requested and the iurc has granted an expedited schedule in this proceeding northern indiana expects a final order in the cause in the second quarter of 2007 

cost recovery and trackers a significant portion of the distribution companies’ revenue is related to the recovery of gas costs the review and recovery of which occurs via standard regulatory proceedings all states require periodic review of actual gas procurement activity to determine prudence and to permit the recovery of prudently incurred costs related to the supply of gas for customers nisource distribution companies have historically been found prudent in the procurement of gas supplies to serve customers 

certain operating costs of the nisource distribution companies are significant recurring in nature and generally outside the control of the distribution companies some states allow the recovery of such costs via cost tracking mechanisms such tracking mechanisms allow for abbreviated regulatory proceedings in order for the distribution companies to implement charges and recover appropriate costs tracking mechanisms allow for more timely recovery of such costs as compared with more traditional cost recovery mechanisms examples of such mechanisms include gas cost recovery adjustment mechanisms tax riders and bad debt recovery mechanisms gas distribution operations revenue is increased by the implementation and recovery of costs via such tracking mechanisms 

comparability of gas distribution operations line item operating results is impacted by these regulatory trackers that allow for the recovery in rates of certain costs such as bad debt expenses increases in the expenses that are the subject of trackers result in a corresponding increase in net revenues and therefore have essentially no impact on total operating income results operating expenses increased by 505 million for expenses which are subject to such trackers and are therefore primarily offset by a corresponding increase to net revenues reflecting recovery of certain costs 

certain of the nisource distribution companies are embarking upon plans to replace significant portions of their operating systems that are nearing the end of their useful life those companies are currently evaluating requests for increases in rates in order to allow recovery of the additional capital expenditures required for such plans each

ldc’s approach to cost recovery may be unique given the different laws regulations and precedent that exist in each jurisdiction currently columbia of pennsylvania and columbia of ohio are evaluating such plans and filings 

certain types of natural gas risers which are owned by customers on columbia of ohio’s distribution system have been evaluated under a study required by the puco and have been found to be prone to leak natural gas under certain conditions on february 1 2007 columbia of ohio announced plans to identify and replace these certain types of risers on its distribution system columbia of ohio estimates that the cost to identify and replace the risers will approximate 200 million and will be seeking approval to implement an infrastructure replacement program cost recovery mechanism 

customer usage the nisource distribution companies continue to experience declining usage by customers due in large part to the sensitivity of sales to historically high commodity prices a significant portion of the ldc’s operating costs are fixed in nature historically rate design at the distribution level has been structured such that a large portion of cost recovery is based upon throughput rather than in a fixed charge many of nisource’s ldcs are evaluating mechanisms that would “decouple” the recovery of fixed costs from throughput and implement recovery mechanisms that more closely link the recovery of fixed costs with fixed charges each of the states that the nisource ldcs operate in has different requirements regarding the procedure for establishing such changes 

environmental matters currently various environmental matters impact the gas distribution operations segment as of december 31 2006 a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions refer to note 18f “environmental matters” in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the gas distribution operations segment 

restructuring payments made for all restructuring initiatives within gas distribution operations amounted to 31 million during 2006 and the restructuring liability remaining at december 31 2006 was 16 million in the third quarter of 2006 an adjustment was made to the restructuring reserve for leased office space reducing the reserve by 52 million this adjustment was made in connection with a reallocation of office space and assessment of office facilities refer to note 3 “restructuring activities” in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding restructuring initiatives for the gas distribution operations segment 

weather in general nisource calculates the weather related revenue variance based on changing customer demand driven by weather variance from normal heating degreedays normal is evaluated using heating degree days across the nisource distribution region while the temperature base for measuring heating degreedays ie the estimated average daily temperature at which heating load begins varies slightly across the region the nisource composite measurement is based on 62 degrees 

weather in the gas distribution operations service territories for 2006 was approximately 12 warmer than normal and 14 warmer than 2005 decreasing net revenues by approximately 89 million for the year ended december 31 2006 compared to 2005 

weather in the gas distribution operations service territories for 2005 was approximately 2 colder than normal and 3 colder than 2004 increasing net revenues by approximately 24 million for the year ended december 31 2005 compared to 2004 

throughput total volumes sold and transported for the year ended december 31 2006 were 8269 mmdth compared to 8644 mmdth for 2005 this decrease reflected lower sales to residential commercial and industrial customers which was attributable mainly to the milder weather and decreased residential customer usage partially offset by increased offsystem sales

gas distribution operations continued 

total volumes sold and transported for the year ended december 31 2005 were 8644 mmdth compared to 8991 mmdth for 2004 this decrease was primarily due to lower industrial and offsystem sales 

net revenues net revenues for 2006 were 14216 million a decrease of 833 million from 2005 this decrease in net revenues was due primarily to the impact of warmer weather amounting to approximately 89 million and a decline in residential usage of approximately 22 million additionally the prior year was favorably impacted 121 million from a buyout of a large customer gas contract these decreases in net revenues were partially offset by a 467 million increase in revenues from regulatory trackers which are primarily offset in operating expenses 

net revenues for 2005 were 15049 million an increase of 643 million from 2004 net revenues grew as a result of increased deliveries of natural gas to residential customers due to colder weather during the fourth quarter of 2005 compared to 2004 and an increase in residential customers that together amounted to 323 million net revenues also increased 262 million as a result of regulatory trackers and 160 million from increases in gross receipts and excise taxes which are both offset in operating expenses as well as 121 million from the buyout of a large customer gas contract these increases in revenues were partially offset by a reduction in gas deliveries to residential and commercial customers of approximately 33 million attributable to a decline in usage caused in part by higher gas prices experienced in 2005 

operating income for the twelve months ended december 31 2006 operating income for the gas distribution operations segment was 2900 million a decrease of 782 million compared to the same period in 2005 largely attributable to reduced net revenues described above operating expenses excluding 505 million of tracker expenses primarily offset in revenues were 556 million lower than the prior year the comparable period last year was impacted by transition costs restructuring charges and a pension and other postretirement benefits charge totaling 494 million associated with the ibm agreement and a 109 million goodwill impairment loss related to kokomo gas operating expenses were impacted this year by higher employee and administrative costs of 119 million expenses associated with the ibm agreement of 85 million primarily for transition services and higher depreciation expense of 68 million partially offset by a reversal in the third quarter of a restructuring reserve for leased office space of 52 million and lower uncollectible accounts 

for the twelve months ended december 31 2005 operating income for the gas distribution operations segment was 3682 million a decrease of 730 million compared to the same period in 2004 the decrease was the result of higher operating expenses of 951 million excluding 422 million of tracker expenses offset in revenues which more than offset the increase in net revenues described above operating income decreased as a result of transition costs restructuring charges and a pension and postretirement benefit charge totaling 494 million associated with the ibm agreement also contributing to the decrease in operating income was higher depreciation expense of 300 million primarily resulting from the 2004 expiration of the prior regulatory stipulation for columbia of ohio a 109 million impairment of goodwill that was originally recorded in association with the nisource acquisition of kokomo gas in 1992 and an increase in employee and administrative expenses of 74 million

proposed millennium pipeline project millennium received ferc approval for a pipeline project in which columbia transmission is participating and will serve as operator which will provide access to a number of supply and storage basins and the dawn ontario trading hub the reconfigured project which was approved by the ferc in a certificate order issued december 21 2006 will begin at an interconnect with empire an existing pipeline that originates at the canadian border and extends easterly towards syracuse new york empire will construct a lateral pipeline southward to connect with millennium near corning new york millennium will extend eastward to an interconnect with algonquin gas transmission co at ramapo new york 

the certificate order approved the project costs related to the construction and development of the millennium project as described above the order also approved the vacating of portions of the original september 2002 millennium certificate that related to other facilities 

the millennium owners no longer believe the recovery of the capitalized costs related to the vacated portions of the project is probable therefore millennium has fully reserved the capitalized costs related to the development of the vacated portions nisource recorded a 13 million charge reflecting its share of millennium’s reserve during the fourth quarter of 2006 

the reconfigured millennium project relies on completion of some or all of several other related pipeline projects proposed by empire algonquin iroquois and islander east collectively referred to as the “companion pipelines” the december 21 2006 certificate order also granted the necessary project approvals to the companion pipelines

hardy storage project in november 2004 columbia transmission and a subsidiary of piedmont reached an agreement to jointly develop a major new underground natural gas storage field to help meet increased market demand for natural gas in the eastern united states hardy storage was then formed by columbia transmission and piedmont to develop a natural gas storage field from a depleted natural gas production field in west virginia the field which will have the capacity to store approximately 12 bcf of natural gas is expected to be able to deliver 176 mmdth per day of firm storage service on behalf of the subscribing customers columbia transmission and piedmont each have a 50 equity interest in the project and columbia transmission will serve as operator of the facilities 

both hardy storage and columbia transmission filed the necessary applications for the projects with the ferc on april 25 2005 and received favorable orders on november 1 2005 on october 26 2006 hardy storage filed an application seeking to amend the november 1 2005 order to revise the initial rates and estimated costs for the project pursuant to executed settlement agreements with hardy storage’s customers the amendment application is uncontested and hardy storage has requested expedited ferc action on the filing by february 28 2007 

on june 29 2006 columbia transmission piedmont and hardy storage entered into multiple agreements to finance the construction of hardy storage under the financing agreement columbia transmission issued guarantees securing payment for amounts issued in connection with hardy storage up until such time as the project is placed in service and satisfies certain performance criteria additional information on this guarantee is provided in note 18c “guarantees and indemnities” in the notes to consolidated financial statements construction began in the first quarter of 2006 and hardy storage is expected to be placed in service in the second quarter of 2007 

other growth projects eastern market expansion a combined storage and transportation project designed to meet core market growth in the midatlantic region that already has binding customer agreements continues with nepa prefiling activities columbia transmission anticipates filing a certificate application with the ferc in april 2007 

capital expenditures and other investing activities the gas transmission and storage operations segment’s capital expenditures and other investing activities were 2081 million in 2006 and 1679 million in 2005 this increase was primarily due to incremental pipeline expenditures including pipeline integrity costs in compliance with the dot’s integrity management rule the gas transmission and storage operations segment’s capital expenditure program and other investing activities are projected to be approximately 19 million higher in 2007 the increase in capital is due to storage and transportation growth projects in key market areas which are served by the gas transmission and storage operations segment 

pipeline firm service contracts since implementation of ferc order no 636 in the early 1990’s the services of columbia transmission and columbia gulf have consisted of open access transportation services and open access storage services in the case of columbia transmission these services are provided primarily to ldcs on october 31 2004 firm contracts expired for both columbia transmission and columbia gulf which represented approximately 60 of the gas transmission and storage operations net annual revenues based upon new commitments gas transmission and storage operations realized a reduction of approximately 34 million in revenues in 2005 under the replacement

contracts the terms of the replacement contracts entered into by columbia transmission and columbia gulf range from one year to 15 years with an average term of approximately seven years these reductions were partially offset by incremental revenues of approximately 27 million that resulted from remarketing efforts and new firm contracts during 2005 and 2006 

sales of shorterterm transportation and storage services seasonal price fluctuations in the national energy market created opportunities for customers to utilize existing shorterterm transportation and storage tariff services provided by columbia transmission and columbia gulf a commercial team is in place focused on this effort to capitalize on market opportunities columbia transmission entered into contracts that represent revenues in excess of 45 million of shorterterm business for 2006 columbia transmission and columbia gulf plan to continue offering these short term transportation and storage services customer requirements for these services will vary according to market conditions which include such factors as commodity price volatility geographic price differentials and the physical capacity and capabilities of the pipeline network 

regulatory matters 

significant ferc developments on june 30 2005 the ferc issued the “order on accounting for pipeline assessment costs” this guidance was issued by the ferc to address consistent application across the industry for accounting of the dot’s integrity management rule the effective date of the guidance was january 1 2006 after which all assessment costs have been recorded as operating expenses importantly the rule specifically provides that amounts capitalized in periods prior to january 1 2006 will be permitted to remain as recorded in november 2005 the ingaa sought review of the matter before the u s court of appeals for the dc circuit ingaa v ferc no 051426 oral argument was presented before the court on january 16 2007 and a ruling is currently pending 

on july 20 2006 the ferc issued a declaratory order in response to a petition filed by tennessee gas pipeline the petition related to a tennessee gas pipeline request to establish an interconnection with the columbia gulf operated portion of the blue water pipeline system columbia gulf has a longstanding practice of providing interconnections with other interstate pipelines only as long as there is an interconnection agreement in place that governs the rules of the interconnection among other things these agreements help protect the integrity of columbia gulf’s system and the reliability of service to its customers the ferc ruled that tennessee gas pipeline’s interconnection request should be governed by the existing blue water pipeline operating agreement between columbia gulf and tennessee gas pipeline columbia gulf constructed the necessary taps and tennessee gas pipeline then completed its portion of the interconnection facilities the interconnection was ready to flow gas on october 1 2006 on december 29 2006 columbia gulf filed in the dc circuit court of appeals a petition for review of the commission’s july 20 2006 order and a subsequent order denying columbia gulf’s request for rehearing 

in the declaratory order the ferc also referred the matter to the office of enforcement to determine if there should be any action taken against columbia gulf for failing to comply with prior orders that directed columbia gulf to allow tennessee gas pipeline to make an interconnection while disappointed with the ferc’s referral of this matter to the office of enforcement columbia gulf has cooperated with the office of enforcement’s investigation columbia gulf expects the staff will complete its investigation in the near future but is unable to predict the outcome at this time

restructuring payments made for all restructuring initiatives within gas transmission and storage operations amounted to 28 million during 2006 and the restructuring liability remaining at december 31 2006 was 22 million refer to note 3 “restructuring activities” in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding restructuring initiatives for the gas transmission and storage operations segment 

throughput columbia transmission’s throughput consists of transportation and storage services for ldcs and other customers within its market area which covers portions of northeastern midatlantic midwestern and southern states and the district of columbia throughput for columbia gulf reflects mainline transportation services delivered to leach kentucky and shorthaul transportation services for gas delivered south of leach kentucky crossroads serves customers in northern indiana and ohio and granite state gas provides service in new hampshire maine and massachusetts intrasegment eliminations represent gas delivered to other pipelines within this segment 

throughput for the gas transmission and storage operations segment totaled 11780 mmdth for 2006 compared to 11721 mmdth in 2005 the increase of 59 mmdth is due to increased sales of shorterterm transportation and storage services described above partially offset by lower gas deliveries by columbia transmission 

throughput for the gas transmission and storage operations segment totaled 11721 mmdth for 2005 compared to 11727 mmdth in 2004 decreases in offshore natural gas production in the gulf were offset by increased gas deliveries in the market area serviced by columbia transmission 

net revenues net revenues were 8505 million for 2006 an increase of 400 million from 2005 the increase in net revenues was mainly due to sales of shorterterm transportation and storage services amounting to 439 million and increased subscriptions for demand services of 128 million the comparable period last year benefited from a thirdparty buyout of a bankruptcy claim relating to the rejection of a shipper’s longterm contract which amounted to 89 million 

net revenues were 8105 million for 2005 a decrease of 221 million from 2004 the decrease was primarily due to the 2004 renegotiation of firm service contracts with major pipeline customers which amounted to approximately 34 million for the year additionally revenue from regulatory trackers decreased 74 million which is offset in operating expenses these reductions in net revenues were partially offset by approximately 14 million in increased revenues resulting from remarketing efforts and new firm contracts and by an 89 million thirdparty buyout of a bankruptcy claim relating to the rejection of a shipper’s longterm contract 

operating income operating income of 3408 million in 2006 decreased 36 million from 2005 primarily due to increased operations and maintenance expenses of 302 million and a 123 million loss on equity earnings from unconsolidated subsidiaries which offset the increase in net revenues described above the loss on equity earnings resulted from a 13 million charge reflecting nisource’s gas transmission and storage operations segment share of millennium’s reserve related to vacated portions of the original project operation and maintenance expenses increased as a result of 181 million accrued for litigation relating to several matters some which were settled during the fourth quarter higher employee and administrative costs of 94 million increased pipeline integrity related costs of 73 million and increased property insurance premiums of 65 million mainly for offshore and onshore facilities located in or near the gulf of mexico the increases in property insurance were driven by the losses experienced by the insurance industry over the past few years resulting from hurricanes such as ivan katrina and rita the operation and maintenance expense increases were partially offset by the impact in the comparable 2005 period of transition costs a restructuring charge and a pension and other postretirement benefit charge totaling 128 million associated with the ibm agreement 

operating income of 3444 million in 2005 decreased 187 million from 2004 due primarily to the reduction in net revenue described above operating expenses excluding savings of 74 million of tracker expense offset in revenue increased 42 million as a result of restructuring charges including a pension and other post retirement

market conditions the regulatory frameworks applicable to electric operations continue to be affected by fundamental changes that will impact electric operations’ structure and profitability notwithstanding those changes competition within the industry will create opportunities to compete for new customers and revenues management has taken steps to improve operating efficiencies in this changing environment 

the us steel industry continues to adjust to changing market conditions including international competition increased energy costs and fluctuating demand for their products the industry has responded with plant consolidation and rationalization to reduce costs and improve their position in the market place increased use of advanced technology by us steel producers has lowered production costs and increased productivity reducing the

labor differential between international producers and those in the united states nisource continued to see strength in industrial sales volumes up 4 over 2005 levels due largely to the steel market and related industries 

northern indiana has identified a need for additional resources to meet its electric customers’ demand in the coming years to assess options to meet this need a request for proposal for purchases of power including renewable energy and demand reducing options was issued the bids are to provide power in the short term as well separate bids to provide power in the long term these bids are being evaluated and compared to other options including building a power plant acquiring a portion of an existing plant entering into a natural gas purchase contract to provide low cost gas for power production and restarting the mitchell station no commitment to pursue any specific option or group of options has been made management anticipates that the evaluation of options will continue through early 2007 

capital expenditures and other investing activities the electric operations segment’s capital expenditures and other investing activities were 1512 million in 2006 and are projected to be approximately 2368 million in 2007 the increase is due to higher expenditures for the nox reduction programs and expenditures to replace key components within electric generation expenditures for the nox reduction program were approximately 4 million in 2006 and are budgeted to be approximately 37 million for 2007 

regulatory matters 

significant rate developments to settle a proceeding regarding northern indiana’s request to recover intermediate dispatchable power costs northern indiana has agreed to file an electric base rate case on or before july 1 2008 

during 2002 northern indiana settled certain regulatory matters related to an electric rate review on september 23 2002 the iurc issued an order adopting most aspects of the settlement the order approving the settlement provides that electric customers of northern indiana will receive bill credits of approximately 551 million each year for a cumulative total of 225 million for the minimum 49month period beginning on july 1 2002 the credits will continue beyond the minimum period at the same annual level and per the same methodology until the iurc enters a basic rate order that approves revised northern indiana’s electric rates subsequent to the minimum period the order included a rate moratorium that expired on july 31 2006 the order also provides that 60 of any future earnings beyond a specified earnings level will be retained by northern indiana the revenue credit is calculated based on electric usage and therefore in times of high usage the credit may be more than the 551 million target credits amounting to 509 million and 585 million were recognized for electric customers for the years ended december 31 2006 and december 31 2005 respectively 

miso as part of northern indiana’s participation in the miso transmission service and wholesale energy market certain administrative fees and nonfuel costs have been incurred iurc orders have been issued authorizing the deferral for consideration in a future rate case proceeding the administrative fees and nonfuel related costs incurred after northern indiana’s rate moratorium which expired on july 31 2006 during 2006 the administrative fees totaled 55 million of this amount 30 million was expensed and 25 million was deferred nonfuel costs were 128 million in 2006 of which 115 million was expensed and 13 million was deferred on may 4 2006 the iurc issued a final order authorizing the categorization of certain types of miso charges as fuelrelated and therefore recoverable through the fac mechanism as a result of this order northern indiana realized an increase in net revenues of 79 million 

on april 25 2006 the ferc issued an order on the miso’s transmission and energy markets tariff stating that miso had violated the tariff on several issues including not assessing revenue sufficiency guarantee charges on virtual bids and offers and for charging revenue sufficiency guarantee charges on imports the ferc ordered miso to perform a resettlement of these charges back to april 1 2005 although the amount of resettlements applicable to northern indiana cannot be quantified at this time it is not expected to be material

sales electric operations sales were 174283 gwh for the year 2006 a slight decrease of 587 gwh compared to 2005 mainly resulting from decreased residential sales due to milder weather this decrease was partially offset by increased industrial volumes particularly in the steel sector 

electric operations sales were 174870 gwh for the year 2005 a slight increase of 1195 gwh compared to 2004 the increase in sales resulted from higher residential and commercial sales due primarily to warmer weather and a 1 increase in customer count this increase in sales was partially offset by decreased industrial and wholesale sales 

net revenues electric operations net revenues were 8224 million for 2006 an increase of 273 million from 2005 due to 135 million of lower unrecoverable miso costs included in cost of sales 107 million from proceeds received for emissions allowances a reduction in customer credits of 77 million due to the timing of the credits increased environmental tracker revenues of 74 million offset in expense an increase in residential and commercial customers amounting to approximately 6 million and increased industrial volumes the lower unrecoverable miso costs resulted mainly from the iurc’s ruling on the recoverability of certain miso costs as well as the deferral of certain costs for future recovery which began on august 1 2006 these increases in net revenues were partially offset by the impact of unfavorable weather compared to the prior year of approximately 21 million 

electric operations net revenues were 7951 million for 2005 an increase of 349 million from 2004 primarily as a result of warmer weather that favorably impacted revenues by 268 million compared to the 2004 period and increased nonweather related usage and customer count totaling 241 million net revenues from environmental trackers also increased 153 million of which 64 million is offset in operating expenses these increases in net revenues were partially offset by net revenue impacts associated with miso day 2 costs totaling 157 million 66 million reduction in revenue associated with pricing and capacity charges of 53 million related to the purchase of power from whiting clean energy 

operating income operating income for 2006 was 3104 million an increase of 171 million from 2005 the increase in operating income was due to the changes in net revenue mentioned above partially offset by higher operating expenses of 102 million operating expenses increased due to higher electric generation and maintenance expense of 93 million higher employee and administrative expenses of approximately 33 million and 48 million in increased other taxes compared to the same period in 2005 the change in operation and maintenance expense was favorably impacted by transition costs a restructuring charge and a pension and other postretirement benefit charge totaling 84 million associated with the ibm agreement made in the comparable 2005 period 

operating income for 2005 was 2933 million a decrease of 162 million from 2004 the decrease was the result of higher operating expenses of 447 million net of 64 million in expenses associated with the operation of nox equipment which are fully offset in net revenues the increase in operating expenses were partially offset by higher net revenues described above the operation and maintenance expenses increase was due mainly to restructuring charges including a pension and other post retirement benefit charge and transition costs associated with outsourcing and the ibm service agreement which totaled 84 million increased electric generating expense of 72 million and incremental miso administrative expenses of 35 million the increase in other tax expense was due mainly to the impact of a 251 million reduction in estimated property tax accruals recognized in 2004 depreciation expense also increased approximately 8 million of which 49 million was due to the operation of nox equipment that is fully offset in revenue

whiting clean energy on december 18 2006 whiting clean energy and bp executed amendment iv which materially amended the terms of the esa under which whiting clean energy provides steam to bp the agreement specifies a planned termination of the esa at the end of 2009 with options for bp to extend the term one additional year under renegotiated steam pricing whiting clean energy accrued 170 million in costs associated with contract termination terms under the agreement in addition amendment iv provides bp an option valid for 180 days from the amendment’s effective date for bp to purchase the facility free of liens for 100 million management believes it is unlikely that bp will exercise this option the carrying amount of the whiting clean energy facility is approximately 275 million 

because of continued losses from whiting clean energy and the amended terms of the agreement between whiting clean energy and bp discussed above an impairment study was performed during 2006 under the provisions of sfas no 144 an impairment loss shall be recognized only if the carrying amount of a long lived asset is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value the test compares the carrying amount of the long lived asset to the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset the study indicated that no impairment charge was necessary 

the study includes many estimates and assumptions for the 35year estimated useful life of the facility changes in these estimates and assumptions such as electricity and natural gas forward prices and price volatility impacts from the terms and options set forth under the definitive agreement with bp as discussed above and utilization of the facility could result in a situation where total undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value of the facility which would result in a writedown that could be significant

rulings by tax authorities or the expiration of the statute of limitations nisource is under continuous examination by the internal revenue service irs the irs has completed its audits through tax year 2000 years through 1998 have been settled and are closed to further assessment for years 1999 and 2000 nisource disagreed with three adjustments proposed by the irs and filed a protest of those issues with the irs appeals division the opening appeals conference was held on march 2 2005 the audit of nisource’s 2001 and 2002 federal income tax returns started on june 1 2004 and is expected to be completed by the end of the third quarter 2005 management currently believes that the ultimate resolution of these matters individually or in the aggregate will not have a material adverse effect on nisource’s business financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

g environmental matters 

general the operations of nisource are subject to extensive and evolving federal state and local environmental laws and regulations intended to protect the public health and the environment such environmental laws and regulations affect operations as they relate to impacts on air water and land 

proposals for voluntary initiatives and mandatory controls are being discussed both in the united states and worldwide to reduce socalled “greenhouse gases” such as carbon dioxide a byproduct of burning fossil fuels and methane a component of natural gas certain nisource affiliates engage in efforts to voluntarily report and reduce their greenhouse gas emissions nisource is currently a participant in the united states environmental protection agency epa’s climate leaders program and will continue to monitor and participate in developments related to efforts to register and potentially regulate greenhouse gas emissions 

gas distribution operations several gas distribution operations subsidiaries are potentially responsible parties at waste disposal sites under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla commonly known as superfund and similar state laws as well as at former manufactured gas plant mgp sites which such subsidiaries or their corporate predecessors own or previously owned or operated gas distribution operations subsidiaries may be required to share in the cost of clean up of such sites in addition some gas distribution operations subsidiaries have responsibility for corrective action under the resource conservation and recovery act rcra for closure and cleanup costs associated with underground storage tanks under the toxic substances control act for clean up of polychlorinated biphenyls and for mercury releases the final costs of clean up have not yet been determined as site investigations and clean up proceed and as additional information becomes available reserves are adjusted 

a program has been instituted to identify and investigate former mgp sites where gas distribution operations subsidiaries or predecessors are the current or former owner the program has identified 85 such sites and initial investigations have been conducted at 49 sites additional investigation activities have been completed or are in progress at 44 sites and remedial measures have been implemented or completed at 27 sites this effort includes the sites contained in the january 2004 agreement entered into by the indiana department of environmental management northern indiana kokomo gas and fuel company and other indiana utilities under the indiana voluntary remediation program only those site investigation characterization and remediation costs currently known and determinable can be considered “probable and reasonably estimable” under sfas no 5 “accounting for contingencies” sfas no 5 as costs become probable and reasonably estimable reserves will be adjusted as reserves are recorded regulatory assets are recorded to the extent environmental expenditures are expected to be recovered through rates nisource is unable at this time to accurately estimate the time frame and potential costs of the entire program management expects that as characterization is completed additional remediation work is performed and more facts become available nisource will be able to develop a probable and reasonable estimate for the entire program or a major portion thereof consistent with the securities and exchange commission’s staff accounting bulletin no 92 “accounting and disclosures relating to loss contingencies” sfas no 5 and american institute of certified public accountants statement of position 961 “environmental remediation liabilities” sop no 961 

as of december 31 2004 a reserve of approximately 627 million has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions the ultimate liability in connection with these sites will depend upon many factors including the volume of material contributed to the site years of ownership or operation the number of other potentially responsible parties and their financial viability and the extent of environmental response actions required based upon investigations and management’s understanding of current environmental laws and regulations

gas transmission and storage operations columbia transmission continues to conduct characterization and remediation activities at specific sites under a 1995 epa administrative order by consent aoc the program pursuant to the aoc covers approximately 245 facilities approximately 13000 liquid removal points approximately 2200 mercury measurement stations and about 3700 storage well locations field characterization has been performed at all sites site characterization reports and remediation plans which must be submitted to the epa for approval are in various stages of development and completion remediation has been completed at the mercury measurement stations liquid removal point sites and storage well locations and at most of the 245 facilities as of december 31 2004 the remaining environmental liability recorded on the consolidated balance sheets of columbia transmission was approximately 36 million 

columbia transmission and columbia gulf are potentially responsible parties at several waste disposal sites under cercla and similar state laws the potential liability is believed to be de minimis however the final allocation of cleanup costs has yet to be determined as site investigations and cleanups proceed and as additional information becomes available reserves will be adjusted 

after a lengthy legal proceeding the epa has begun implementing the particulate matter and ozone national ambient air quality standards it revised in july 1997 as a result the epa has designated areas not attaining the standards the clean air act provides for a process that would provide for promulgation of rules specifying a compliance level compliance deadline and necessary controls to be implemented within designated areas over the next few years in the interim existing ozone ambient air quality standards will remain in place and may require imposition of additional controls in areas of nonattainment in addition the epa has reissued the portion of the nitrogen oxide nox state implementation plan sip call regulation dealing with regional ozone transport which is applicable to certain pipeline engines but which was remanded by the court of appeals after challenge by the pipeline industry the resulting rules require additional reductions in nox emissions from reciprocating engines and turbines at pipeline compressor stations including compressor stations owned by columbia transmission and columbia gulf the epa and state regulatory authorities are in the process of setting final implementation requirements certain states have already begun to propose new nox emission requirements that may be applicable to pipeline compressor station engines and turbines nisource believes that the costs relating to compliance with any new limits may be significant but are dependent upon the ultimate control program established by the targeted states and the epa and currently are not reasonably estimable nisource will continue to closely monitor developments in this area 

electric operations air in december 2001 the epa approved regulations developed by the state of indiana to comply with the epa’s nox sip call the nox sip call requires certain states including indiana to reduce nox levels from several sources including industrial and utility boilers to lower regional transport of ozone compliance with the nox limits contained in these rules was required by may 31 2004 to comply with the rule northern indiana developed a nox compliance plan and is currently in compliance with the nox limits in implementing the nox compliance plan northern indiana has expended approximately 2507 million as of december 31 2004 to install selective catalytic reduction nox reduction technology at each of its active generating stations and estimates total capital costs of approximately 305 million actual compliance costs may vary depending on a number of factors including market demand and resource constraints uncertainty of future equipment and construction costs and the potential need for additional control technology 

on april 15 2004 the epa finalized the 8hour ozone nonattainment area designations after designation the clean air act provides for a process for promulgation of rules specifying a compliance level compliance deadline and necessary controls to be implemented within designated areas over the next few years resulting state rules could require additional reductions in nox emissions from coalfired boilers including northern indiana’s electric generating stations until the rules are promulgated the potential impact on northern indiana is uncertain northern indiana will continue to closely monitor developments in this area 

on june 28 and 29 2004 the epa responded to the states’ initial recommendations for the epa designation of areas meeting and not meeting the national ambient air quality standards naaqs for fine particles fine particles

are those less than or equal to 25 micrometers in diameter and are also referred to as pm25 the epa’s pm25 nonattainment designations were announced on december 17 2004 and published in the federal register on january 5 2005 the designations become effective on april 5 2005 indiana has disputed some of the june 2004 epa designation recommendations and submitted final 2004 monitoring data on february 17 2005 for epa reevaluation of the disputed areas on march 7 2005 the indiana attorney general filed a legal action on behalf of the indiana department of environmental management idem asking that all but three areas none of these three areas are in northern indiana’s service territory be removed from the epa’s nonattainment list the epa is expected to finalize by early 2006 an implementation rule detailing state obligations to bring the nonattainment areas into attainment with the pm25 naaqs indiana and other states will be required to finalize state rulemaking by april 2008 that specify emissions reductions consistent with the final epa implementation rule to bring the designated areas into attainment by as early as april 2010 northern indiana will continue to closely monitor developments in this area 

the epa is scheduled to issue final regulations in march of 2005 the clean air interstate rule cair and the clean air mercury rule camr that will require multipollutant sulfur dioxide so2 nox and mercury emissions reductions from electric power generating stations as an alternative to the regulatory approach the administration will again pursue multipollutant legislation in 2005 the clear skies act which would require significant reductions of so2 nox and mercury emissions from electric power generating stations including northern indiana’s stations both the epa’s proposed regulations and legislation contain phasedin reductions for these three pollutants under alternative control approaches including trading programs until the legislation passes and or the rulemaking is completed by the epa and implemented by the states the potential impact on northern indiana will be uncertain nonetheless if implemented these potential reduction requirements could impose substantial costs on affected utilities including northern indiana 

in late 1999 the epa initiated a new source review enforcement action against several industries including the electric utility industry concerning rule interpretations that have been the subject of recent prospective reform regulations northern indiana has received and responded to the epa information requests on this subject most recently in june 2002 the epa issued a notice of violation nov to northern indiana on september 29 2004 for alleged violations of the clean air act and the sip specifically the nov alleges that modifications were made to certain boiler units at the michigan city schahfer and bailly generating stations between the years of 1985 and 1995 without obtaining appropriate air permits for the modifications northern indiana has held meetings with the epa to discuss the violations alleged in the nov but is unable at this time to predict the timing or likely outcome of this epa action 

the epa has issued final maximum achievable control technology standards for hazardous air pollutants for stationary combustion turbines industrial boilers and reciprocating internal combustion engines the final regulations are not expected to have a substantial impact on northern indiana 

on april 15 2004 the epa proposed amendments to its july 1999 regional haze rule that requires states to set periodic goals for improving visibility in 156 natural areas across the united states by implementing state emission reduction rules these amendments would apply to the best available retrofit technology bart for bart eligible industrial facilities emitting air pollutants that reduce visibility states must develop implementation rules by january 2008 resulting rules could require additional reductions of nox so2 and particulate matter from coalfired boilers including northern indiana’s electric generating stations depending upon the outcome of multipollutant regulationslegislation until the state rules are promulgated the potential impact on northern indiana is uncertain northern indiana will continue to closely monitor developments in this area 

water  the great lakes water quality initiative gli program is expected to add new water quality standards for facilities that discharge into the great lakes watershed including northern indiana’s three electric generating stations located on lake michigan the state of indiana has promulgated its regulations for this water discharge permit program and has received final epa approval all issues in subsequent litigation related to the epa’s actions have been resolved with the exception of the epa’s disapproval of the idem method for testing whole effluent toxicity northern indiana expects that idem will issue a proposed permit renewal for each of its operating lakeside stations pending issuance of these permits the costs of complying with these requirements cannot be predicted at this time

on february 16 2004 the epa administrator signed the phase ii rule of the clean water act section 316b which requires all large existing steam electric generating stations meet certain performance standards to reduce the mortality of aquatic organisms at their cooling water intake structures the rule became effective on september 7 2004 under this rule plants will either have to demonstrate that the performance of their existing fish protection systems meet the new standards or develop new systems whose compliance is based on any of five options specific impacts of the final phase ii rule on the four 4 northern indiana generating stations are in the process of being determined at this time 

remediation northern indiana is a potentially responsible party under the cercla and similar state laws at two waste disposal sites and shares in the cost of their cleanup with other potentially responsible parties at one site investigations are ongoing and final costs of clean up have not yet been determined at the second site northern indiana has entered into epa administrative orders on consent to perform an interim action in conjunction with the landfill owneroperator which includes providing a municipal water supply system for approximately 275 homes northern indiana has also agreed to conduct a remedial investigation and feasibility study in the vicinity of the third party statepermitted landfill where northern indiana contracted for fly ash disposal 

in addition northern indiana has corrective action liability under the resource conservation  recovery act rcra for 3 facilities that historically stored hazardous waste as of december 31 2004 a reserve of approximately 09 million has been recorded to cover probable environmental investigation costs the ultimate liability in connection with these sites cannot be estimated at this time but could be significant 

in october 2004 northern indiana received from the epa a draft administrative order on consent proceeding under the authority of section 3008h of the resource conservation and recovery act according to the draft order the epa has allegedly determined that corrective action is necessary at northern indiana’s bailly generating station to address documented releases of hazardous wastes or hazardous constituents and to protect human health and the environment the order requires northern indiana to identify the nature and extent of releases of hazardous waste and hazardous constituents from the facility with the goal of no unacceptable human exposures to contamination and the stabilization of any contaminated groundwater from the facility it is anticipated that northern indiana and the epa will enter into a consent order sometime during the first quarter of 2005 a reserve has been established to fund the required investigations and conduct interim measures at the facility the final costs of clean up have not yet been determined as site investigations and clean up proceed and as additional information becomes available reserves are adjusted 

other operations pei in connection with the sale of certain pei assets mentioned above nisource has agreed to provide indemnification to the purchaser for specified potential environmental liabilities however the total amount of these liabilities is not reasonably estimable at this time 

on june 26 2002 the epa issued an nov to three companies involved with a project at ispat inland inc’s east chicago indiana facility including pei’s former subsidiary cokenergy the nov alleges violations of the construction permit requirements of the clean air act at issue is whether air emissions permitting requirements for major sources applied to the construction of the project in 1997 nisource maintains that the project was properly permitted by the idem and cannot predict whether any fines or penalties will be assessed or if additional compliance costs will be incurred 

other information other affiliates nisource affiliates have retained environmental liabilities including cleanup liabilities associated with some of its former operations including those of propane operations petroleum operations certain local gas distribution companies and cer the most significant environmental liability relates to former mgp sites whereas less significant liabilities are associated with former petroleum operations and former mercury metering stations 

the ultimate liability in connection with these contamination sites will depend upon many factors including the extent of environmental response actions required other potentially responsible parties and their financial viability and indemnification from previous facility owners only those corrective action costs currently known and determinable can be considered “probable and reasonably estimable” under sfas no 5 and consistent with sop no 961 as costs become probable and reasonably estimable reserves will be adjusted as appropriate nisource

believes that any environmental response actions required at former operations for which it is ultimately liable will not have a material adverse effect on nisource’s financial position 

environmental reserves it is management’s continued intent to address environmental issues in cooperation with regulatory authorities in such a manner as to achieve mutually acceptable compliance plans however there can be no assurance that fines and penalties will not be incurred management expects most environmental assessment and remediation costs to be recoverable through rates for certain nisource companies 

as of december 31 2004 a reserve of approximately 726 million has been recorded to cover probable corrective actions at sites where nisource has environmental remediation liability regulatory assets have been recorded to the extent environmental expenditures are expected to be recovered in rates the ultimate liability in connection with these sites will depend upon many factors including the volume of material contributed to the site the number of the other potentially responsible parties and their financial viability the extent of corrective actions required and rate recovery based upon investigations and management’s understanding of current environmental laws and regulations nisource believes that any corrective actions required will not have a material effect on its financial position or results of operations

whiting clean energy pei’s whiting clean energy project at bp’s whiting indiana refinery was placed in service in 2002 initially the facility was not able to deliver steam to bp to the extent originally contemplated without plant modifications whiting clean energy reached an agreement in october 2004 with the engineering procurement and construction contractor which requires the contractor to pay for a portion of the necessary plant modifications and other expenses whiting clean energy is also pursuing recovery from the insurance provider for construction delays and necessary plant modifications and repairs

for 2004 the pei holding companies’ consolidated aftertax loss was approximately 328 million the profitability of the whiting project in future periods will be dependent on among other things current negotiations with bp amoco regarding steam requirements for bp’s refinery an electric sales agreement currently under negotiation prevailing prices in the energy markets and regional load dispatch patterns because of the expected losses from this facility and decreases in estimated forward pricing for electricity versus changes in gas prices an impairment study was performed in the first quarter of 2003 on this facility in accordance with sfas no 144 “accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets” the study indicated that at that time no impairment was necessary 

however the study includes many estimates and assumptions for the 40year estimated useful life of the facility changes in these estimates and assumptions such as forward prices for electricity and gas volatility in the market etc could result in a situation where total undiscounted net revenues are less than the carrying value of the facility which would result in a writedown that could be significant

during the second quarter 2003 nisource realigned its reportable segments to reflect the announced sale of its exploration and production operations as of the second quarter 2003 nisource no longer reported an exploration and production operations segment in addition the pei subsidiaries sold are reported as discontinued operations all periods have been adjusted to conform with the realignment 

nisource’s operations are divided into four primary business segments the gas distribution operations segment provides natural gas service and transportation for residential commercial and industrial customers in ohio pennsylvania virginia kentucky maryland indiana massachusetts maine and new hampshire the gas transmission and storage operations segment offers gas transportation and storage services for local distribution companies marketers and industrial and commercial customers located in northeastern midatlantic midwestern and southern states and the district of columbia the electric operations segment provides electric service in 21 counties in the northern part of indiana the other operations segment primarily includes gas marketing power marketing and trading and ventures focused on distributed power generation technologies including cogeneration facilities fuel cells and storage systems 

the following tables provide information about business segments nisource uses operating income as its primary measurement for each of the reported segments and makes decisions on finance dividends and taxes at the corporate level on a consolidated basis segment revenues include intersegment sales to affiliated subsidiaries which are eliminated in consolidation affiliated sales are recognized on the basis of prevailing market regulated prices or at levels provided for under contractual agreements operating income is derived from revenues and expenses directly associated with each segment

subsequent to the issuance of its consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2004 management of the company determined that the cash flows associated with discontinued operations should not have been presented as a single line item in operating activities within the statements of consolidated cash flows cash flows from discontinued operations are now reported separately in operating investing and financing activities nisource has restated the statements of consolidated cash flows for the years ended december 31 2003 and 2002 there was no change required in the presentation of discontinued operations in the statement of consolidated cash flows for the year ended december 31 2004 

in connection with the preparation of the report on form 10q for the quarter ended june 30 2005 nisource began classifying activity in restricted cash as an investing activity within “other investing activities” nisource previously reported such changes as an operating activity in the statements of consolidated cash flows for the years ended december 31 2004 2003 and 2002 the classification of the activity in restricted cash balances has been reclassified to an investing activity within “other investing activities”

note regarding forwardlooking statements the management’s discussion and analysis including statements regarding market risk sensitive instruments contains “forwardlooking statements” within the meaning of section 27a of the securities act of 1933 as amended and section 21e of the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended investors and prospective investors should understand that many factors govern whether any forwardlooking statement contained herein will be or can be realized any one of those factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected these forwardlooking statements include but are not limited to statements concerning nisource inc’s nisource plans objectives expected performance expenditures and recovery of expenditures through rates stated on either a consolidated or segment basis and any and all underlying assumptions and other statements that are other than statements of historical fact from time to time nisource may publish or otherwise make available forwardlooking statements of this nature all such subsequent forwardlooking statements whether written or oral and whether made by or on behalf of nisource are also expressly qualified by these cautionary statements all forwardlooking statements are based on assumptions that management believes to be reasonable however there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ materially 

realization of nisource’s objectives and expected performance is subject to a wide range of risks and can be adversely affected by among other things weather fluctuations in supply and demand for energy commodities growth opportunities for nisource’s businesses increased competition in deregulated energy markets the success of regulatory and commercial initiatives dealings with third parties over whom nisource has no control the scope timing and impact of any outsourcing initiative actual operating experience of nisource assets the regulatory process regulatory and legislative changes changes in general economic capital and commodity market conditions and counterparty credit risk many of which risks are beyond the control of nisource in addition the relative contributions to profitability by each segment and the assumptions underlying the forwardlooking statements relating thereto may change over time 

consolidated review 

executive summary 

nisource generates virtually 100 of the company’s operating income through the sale distribution transportation and storage of natural gas and the generation transmission and distribution of electricity which are rate regulated a significant portion of nisource’s operations is subject to seasonal fluctuations in sales during the heating season which is primarily from november through march net revenues from gas are more significant and during the cooling season which is primarily from june through september net revenues from electric sales and transportation services are more significant than in other months 

item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

nisource inc 

as a regulated company nisource is exposed to regulatory risk and manages this risk by monitoring its operations and working with various regulatory bodies to maintain a business that continues to provide value for its customers and stockholders in this changing environment in 2003 and 2004 nisource implemented several innovative agreements by working collaboratively with regulators and other key stakeholders ohio regulators approved an uncollectible expense rider in 2003 that began in april 2004 which allowed columbia gas of ohio inc columbia of ohio to recover previously uncollected bad debts from january 1 2003 forward and also allowed paymenttroubled customers to have the opportunity to participate in choice ® programs for the first time in 2004 ohio regulators modified parts of a regulatory stipulation designed to enhance the choice ® program and provide columbia of ohio customers rate certainty nisource’s pipeline companies completed the renegotiation of most of their firm transportation and storage service contracts with their customers in 2004 as these contracts expired on october 31 2004 in december 2004 northern indiana public service company northern indiana was granted approval by the indiana utility regulatory commission iurc to initiate a oneyear pilot program for lowincome energy assistance entitled “nipsco winter warmth” which will be funded by a surcharge to customers and a northern indiana contribution in 2003 northern indiana received approval from the iurc to recover costs associated with environmental compliance programs for nitrogen oxide pollution reduction equipment at the company’s generating stations for which northern indiana recorded revenues of 223 million in 2004 related to qualified capital and operating costs overall nisource’s regulatory strategies that were initiated in 2003 and 2004 have begun to produce returns and benefit both its customers and the company all regulatory matters are discussed in the segment sections of the management discussion and analysis 

in addition to the regulatory initiatives nisource has closely controlled operation and maintenance costs and reduced debt and interest expense with the focus on regulated operations and organizational structure nisource was able to deliver income from continuing operations of 163 per share for the year ended december 31 2004 

during 2004 total long and shortterm borrowings decreased 3538 million additionally interest expense was 608 million lower for the twelve months ended december 31 2004 compared with 2003 due to lower longterm interest rates as a result of refinancing activity completed in 2003 and 2004 nisource currently anticipates that its 900 million of notes due in november 2005 will be replaced with a new debt issue in the fourth quarter of 2004 nisource entered into forward swap arrangements to reduce its risk of rising interest rates relating to its anticipated refinancing of these notes in november 2005 

going forward nisource will continue to focus on the regulated core businesses of strategically located gas and electric operations that generate virtually 100 of the company’s operating income nisource will also continue to explore commercial and regulatory initiatives that benefit both customers and shareholders invest in pipeline expansion and storage projects to bring additional gas supplies to key markets improve the balance sheet and lower operating expenses in addition to initiatives already underway nisource is exploring refinancing opportunities that could further reduce interest expense management is also evaluating initiatives to lower operation and maintenance costs outsourcing may be a part of a comprehensive approach to capture this opportunity 

financial results for 2005 are expected to be negatively impacted by some of these operational and financial initiatives along with impacts of regulatory proceedings and pipeline recontracting that took place in 2004 earnings per share from continuing operations could be 010 to 015 lower than 2004 results 

nisource also intends to increase the level of capital expenditures and other investing activities during 2005 for 2005 the projected capital program is expected to be 6236 million which is 1002 million higher than the 2004 level this higher spending is mainly due to increased expenditures for pipeline integrity related work and growth initiatives in the gas transmission and storage operations segment and system upgrades in the gas distribution operations segment to maintain service and reliability the program is expected to be funded primarily with cash from operations

finally nisource has always been committed to providing accurate and complete financial reporting as well as requiring a strong commitment to ethical behavior by its employees during 2004 nisource documented and tested all significant controls across its financial processes and nisource’s management has concluded that the company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of the end of the period covered by the annual report refer to item 9a “management’s report on internal controls over financial reporting” nisource’s senior management takes an active role in the development of the form 10k and the monitoring of the company’s internal control structure and performance in addition nisource will continue the mandatory ethics training program in which employees at every level and in every function of the organization participate 

results of operations 

the consolidated review information should be read taking into account the critical accounting policies applied by nisource and discussed in “other information” of this item 7 

income from continuing operations and net income for the twelve months ended december 31 2004 nisource reported income from continuing operations of 4302 million or 163 per share compared to 4257 million or 164 per share in 2003 and 3981 million or 189 per share in 2002 

including results from discontinued operations and a change in accounting nisource reported 2004 net income of 4363 million or 165 per share 2003 net income of 852 million or 033 per share and 3725 million or 177 per share for 2002 earnings per share are not comparable because of 68 million shares issued upon the settlement of forward stock purchase contracts comprising a component of nisource’s stock appreciation income linked securities sm sails sm  in november 2004 131 million shares issued upon the settlement of forward equity agreements in february 2003 and an equity offering of 414 million shares that was completed in november 2002 

net revenues total consolidated net revenues gross revenues less cost of sales for the twelve months ended december 31 2004 were 30557 million a 46 million decrease compared with 2003 gas distribution operations net revenues decreased 360 million primarily as a result of reduced residential and commercial natural gas deliveries due to warmer weather of approximately 33 million compared to last year and lower revenues from contract cost reduction programs reduced sales of retail products releases of capacity and gas cost incentives that amounted to 331 million partially offset by increased revenues from regulatory strategies of approximately 258 million from the stipulation agreement granted for columbia of ohio and the recovery for conservation measures granted to bay state gas company bay state the reduction in gas distribution operations net revenue was partially offset by a 316 million increase in electric net revenue for 2004 as compared to 2003 this was the result of higher net revenues from environmental trackers increased customer usage and the effect of reserves recorded for regulatory refunds in the comparable 2003 period 

total consolidated net revenues for the twelve months ended december 31 2003 were 30603 million a 106 million decrease compared with 2002 items that favorably impacted the year included colder weather during the heating season in the first quarter amounting to 60 million and modest increases in nonweather related volume of 154 million these favorable items were offset by reduced electric revenue of 219 million due to cooler weather during the summer cooling season lower interruptible service revenues and firm service revenues of 197 million in the gas transmission and storage operations segment due to measures undertaken during the first quarter period of sustained colderthannormal weather a decrease in storage and transportation revenues of 135 million due mainly to reduced deliveries to power generating facilities and credits totaling 245 million pertaining to the indiana utility regulatory commission iurc electric rate review settlement

for 2004 capital expenditures and other investing activities were 5234 million a decrease of 491 million from 2003 this reduction in capital expenditures was mainly due to a reduction in expenditures for nitrogen oxide nox compliance the gas distribution operations segment’s capital program in 2004 included initiatives to extend service to new areas and develop future markets through new services that may be added to the existing business and to create a potential new pool of customers as well as expenditures to ensure safe reliable and improved service to customers and modernize and upgrade facilities the gas transmission and storage operations segment invested primarily in modernizing and upgrading facilities and meeting the needs of existing and new customers through the construction of significant new facilities either whollyowned by nisource or in partnership with other qualified project participants electric operations capital program included improvements related to the operational integrity of generation transmission and distribution assets expenditures related to environmental compliance regarding nox reduction and additions to electric distribution systems related to new customers capital expenditures in other operations mainly comprise partnership investments and enterprisewide information technology infrastructure improvement in 2004 other operations included a recovery of funds related to prior year investments

off balance sheet arrangements 

nisource has issued guarantees that support up to approximately 12 billion of commodityrelated payments for its current subsidiaries involved in energy marketing and power trading and to satisfy requirements under forward gas sales agreements of a former subsidiary these guarantees were provided to counterparties in order to facilitate physical and financial transactions involving natural gas and electricity to the extent liabilities exist under the commodityrelated contracts subject to these guarantees such liabilities are included in the consolidated balance sheets in addition nisource has other guarantees purchase commitments operating leases lines of credit and letters of credit outstanding refer to note 6 “risk management and energy trading activities” and note 17 “other commitments and contingencies” in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information about nisource’s off balance sheet arrangements

in addition nisource has sold certain accounts receivable nisource’s accounts receivable programs qualify for sale accounting because they meet the conditions specified in statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 140 “accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities” in the agreements all transferred assets have been isolated from the transferor and put presumptively beyond the reach of the transferor and its creditors even in bankruptcy or other receivership nisource does not retain any interest in the receivables under these programs refer to note 16 “fair value of financial instruments” in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on these agreements

critical accounting policies nisource applies certain accounting policies based on the accounting requirements discussed below that have had and may continue to have significant impacts on nisource’s results of operations and consolidated balance sheets 

item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

nisource inc 

basis of accounting for rateregulated subsidiaries statement of financial accounting standards no 71 “accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation” sfas no 71 provides that rateregulated subsidiaries account for and report assets and liabilities consistent with the economic effect of the way in which regulators establish rates if the rates established are designed to recover the costs of providing the regulated service and if the competitive environment makes it probable that such rates can be charged and collected nisource’s rateregulated subsidiaries follow the accounting and reporting requirements of sfas no 71 certain expenses and credits subject to utility regulation or rate determination normally reflected in income are deferred on the consolidated balance sheets and are recognized in income as the related amounts are included in service rates and recovered from or refunded to customers the total amounts of regulatory assets and liabilities reflected on the consolidated balance sheets were 9984 million and 12143 million at december 31 2004 and 8932 million and 11645 million at december 31 2003 respectively for additional information refer to note 1d “basis of accounting for rateregulated subsidiaries” in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

in the event that regulation significantly changes the opportunity for nisource to recover its costs in the future all or a portion of nisource’s regulated operations may no longer meet the criteria for the application of sfas no 71 in such event a writedown of all or a portion of nisource’s existing regulatory assets and liabilities could result if transition cost recovery is approved by the appropriate regulatory bodies that would meet the requirements under generally accepted accounting principles for continued accounting as regulatory assets and liabilities during such recovery period the regulatory assets and liabilities would be reported at the recoverable amounts if unable to continue to apply the provisions of sfas no 71 nisource would be required to apply the provisions of sfas no 101 “regulated enterprises — accounting for the discontinuation of application of financial accounting standards board fasb statement no 71” in management’s opinion nisource’s regulated subsidiaries will be subject to sfas no 71 for the foreseeable future 

certain of the regulatory assets reflected on nisource’s consolidated balance sheets require specific regulatory action in order to be included in future service rates although recovery of these amounts is not guaranteed nisource believes that these costs meet the requirements for deferral as regulatory assets under sfas no 71 regulatory assets requiring specific regulatory action amounted to 1745 million at december 31 2004 if nisource determined that the amounts included as regulatory assets were not recoverable a charge to income would immediately be required to the extent of the unrecoverable amounts 

accounting for risk management activities under sfas no 133 “accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities” as subsequently amended by sfas no 137 sfas no 138 and sfas no 149 collectively referred to as sfas no 133 the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and resulting designation unrealized and realized gains and losses are recognized each period as components of other comprehensive income earnings or regulatory assets and liabilities depending on the nature of such derivatives for subsidiaries that utilize derivatives for cash flow hedges the effective portions of the gains and losses are recorded to other comprehensive income and are recognized in earnings concurrent with the disposition of the hedged risks for fair value hedges the gains and losses are recorded in earnings each period along with the change in the fair value of the hedged item as a result of the rate making process the rateregulated subsidiaries generally record gains and losses as regulatory liabilities or assets and recognize such gains or losses in earnings when both the contracts settle and the physical commodity flows these gains and losses recognized in earnings are then subsequently recovered in revenues through rates 

in order for a derivative contract to be designated as a hedge the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item or transaction must be highly effective the effectiveness test is performed at the inception of the hedge and each reporting period thereafter throughout the period that the hedge is designated any amounts determined to be ineffective are recorded currently in earnings 

item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

nisource inc 

although nisource applies some judgment in the assessment of hedge effectiveness to designate certain derivatives as hedges the nature of the contracts used to hedge the underlying risks is such that the correlation of the changes in fair values of the derivatives and underlying risks is high nisource generally uses nymex exchangetraded natural gas futures and options contracts and overthecounter swaps based on published indices to hedge the risks underlying its naturalgasrelated businesses nisource had 2094 million and 1887 million of price risk management assets and 524 million and 367 million of price risk management liabilities all primarily related to hedges at december 31 2004 and 2003 respectively the amount of unrealized gains recorded to other comprehensive income net of tax was 939 million and 917 million at december 31 2004 and 2003 respectively 

accounting for energy trading activities energy trading activities refers to energy contracts entered into with the objective of generating profits on or from exposure to shifts or changes in market prices nisource evaluates the contracts of its trading operations in accordance with the criteria for derivative contracts under sfas no 133 through 2002 contracts not meeting the criteria under sfas no 133 were recorded at fair value under emerging issues task force issue no 9810 “accounting for energy trading and risk management activities” eitf no 9810 

pursuant to eitf no 9810 when certain trading criteria are met energy contracts including “energyrelated contracts” such as tolling transportation and storage contracts should be accounted for at fair value marked to market along with any related derivative contracts recognizing related gains and losses currently in earnings in the october 2002 eitf meeting eitf no 9810 was rescinded and only contracts meeting the definition in sfas no 133 can be marked to market refer to note 6 “risk management and energy trading activities” in the notes to consolidated financial statement for further information 

while the assessment of fair values for nisource’s trading contracts have been mainly based on pricing information for exchangetraded contracts transportation and storage agreements related to gas trading deals entered into prior to the cessation of gas trading activities were marked to fair value based on the results of internal models no estimates of fair values on transportation and storage contracts related to gas trading activities remained as of december 31 2002 due to the sale or expiration of all gastrading related agreements during the year in addition power trading options were marked to fair value through earnings based on internal calculations of fair value employing the widelyused blackscholes option pricing model the fair value of the “marktofairvalue” options outstanding was a loss of 30 million and a loss of 15 million at december 31 2004 and 2003 respectively 

nisource’s consolidated balance sheets contained price risk management assets of 88 million and 219 million and price risk management liabilities of 119 million and 234 million at december 31 2004 and 2003 respectively related to unrealized gains and losses on trading activities 

pensions and postretirement benefits nisource has defined benefit plans for both pensions and other postretirement benefits the plans are accounted for under sfas no 87 “employers’ accounting for pensions” and sfas no 106 “employers’ accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions” the calculation of the net obligations and annual expense related to the plans requires a significant degree of judgment regarding the discount rates to be used in bringing the liabilities to present value longterm returns on plan assets and employee longevity among other assumptions due to the size of the plans and the longterm nature of the associated liabilities changes in the assumptions used in the actuarial estimates could have material impacts on the measurement of the net obligations and annual expense recognition for further discussion of nisource’s pensions and other postretirement benefits see note 10 “pension and other postretirement benefits” in the notes to consolidated financial statements

sfas no 123 revised 2004 — sharebased payment sfas no 123r in december 2004 the fasb issued sfas no 123r which requires that the cost resulting from all sharebased payment transactions be recognized in the financial statements and establishes fair value as the measurement objective in accounting for these transactions this statement is effective for public entities as of the beginning of the first interim or annual reporting period beginning after june 15 2005 using a modified version of the prospective application 

nisource has traditionally awarded stock options to employees at the beginning of each year that vested one year from the date of grant for stock options granted during january 2005 the company awarded stock options that vested immediately but included a oneyear exercise restriction due to the oneyear vesting terms of the options awarded prior to 2005 and the immediate vesting of the options awarded in january 2005 no amounts from the value of stock options awarded during or prior to june 15 2005 will result in the recognition of expense during 2005 in accordance with sfas no 123r however any stock options awarded after june 15 2005 will result in compensation expense over the related future vesting periods nisource anticipates that the adoption of this statement in the third quarter of 2005 will not have a material impact to nisource’s financial position or results of operations for 2005

fasb interpretation no 46 revised december 2003 — consolidation of variable interest entities on january 17 2003 the fasb issued interpretation no 46 “consolidation of variable interest entities” fin 46r fin 46r requires a variable interest entity to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entity’s activities or is entitled to receive a majority of the entity’s residual returns a company that consolidates a variable interest entity is called the primary beneficiary of that entity in general a variable interest entity is a corporation partnership trust or any other legal structure used for business purposes that either a does not have equity investors with voting rights or b has equity investors that do not provide sufficient financial resources for the entity to support its activities fin 46r also requires various disclosures about variable interest entities that a company is not required to consolidate but in which it has a significant variable interest on december 18 2003 the fasb deferred the implementation of fin 46r to the first quarter of 2004 as a result nisource consolidated certain low income housing real estate investments beginning in the first quarter of 2004 upon consolidation nisource increased its longterm debt by approximately 40 million nisource does not guarantee the debt payment of these lowincome housing real estate investments 

environmental matters nisource affiliates have retained environmental liability including cleanup liability associated with some of its former operations including those of propane operations petroleum operations certain local gas distribution companies and cer most significant environmental liability relates to former manufactured gas plant mgp sites whereas less significant liability is associated with former petroleum operations and metering stations using mercurycontaining measuring equipment

nisource inc 

the ultimate liability in connection with the contamination sites will depend upon many factors including the extent of environmental response actions required other potentially responsible parties and their financial viability and indemnification from previous facility owners only those corrective action costs currently known and determinable can be considered “probable and reasonably estimable” under sfas no 5 “accounting for contingencies” and consistent with american institute of certified public accountants statement of position 961 “environmental remediation liabilities” as costs become probable and reasonably estimable reserves will be recorded and adjusted as appropriate nisource believes that any environmental response actions required at former operations for which it is ultimately liable will not have a material adverse effect on nisource’s financial position 

proposals for voluntary initiatives and mandatory controls are being discussed both in the united states and worldwide to reduce socalled “greenhouse gases” such as carbon dioxide a byproduct of burning fossil fuels and methane a component of natural gas certain nisource affiliates engage in efforts to voluntarily report and reduce their greenhouse gas emissions nisource is currently a participant in united states environmental protection agency epa’s climate leaders program and will continue to monitor and participate in developments related to efforts to register and potentially regulate greenhouse gas emissions

competition gas distribution operations competes with investorowned municipal and cooperative electric utilities throughout its service area and to a lesser extent with other regulated natural gas utilities and propane and fuel oil suppliers gas distribution operations continues to be a strong competitor in the energy market as a result of strong customer preference for natural gas competition with providers of electricity is generally strongest in the residential and commercial markets of kentucky southern ohio central pennsylvania and western virginia where electric rates are primarily driven by lowcost coalfired generation in ohio and pennsylvania gas on gas competition is also common gas competes with fuel oil and propane in the new england markets mainly due to the installed base of fuel oil and propanebased heating which over time has comprised a declining percentage of the overall market 

restructuring since 2000 nisource has implemented restructuring initiatives to streamline its operations and realize efficiencies from the acquisition of columbia the restructuring activities were primarily associated with reductions in headcount and facility exit costs 

in connection with these restructuring initiatives a total of approximately 1600 management professional administrative and technical positions throughout all nisource segments have been identified for elimination as of december 31 2004 approximately 1560 employees throughout all nisource segments had been terminated of whom approximately 13 employees were terminated during 2004 payments made in 2004 in respect of the restructuring items within gas distribution operations was 16 million additionally during 2004 the restructuring reserve was decreased by 05 million related to previous restructuring initiatives due to adjustments in estimated costs the liability associated with these restructuring initiatives at december 31 2004 and 2003 was 78 million and 99 million respectively with 73 million related to facility exit costs at december 31 2004 

regulatory matters changes in gas industry regulation which began in the mid1980s at the federal level have broadened to retail customers at the state level for many years large industrial and commercial customers have had the ability to purchase natural gas directly from marketers and to use gas distribution operations’ facilities for transportation services beginning in the mid1990s gas distribution operations has provided these “choice ® ” programs for its retail customers through the month of december 2004 approximately 713 thousand of gas distribution operations’ residential and small commercial and industrial customers selected an alternate supplier 

gas distribution operations continues to offer choice ® opportunities through regulatory initiatives in all of its jurisdictions while choice ® programs generally provide all customer classes with the opportunity to obtain gas supplies from alternative merchants gas distribution operations expects to play a substantial role in supplying gas commodity services to its customers for the foreseeable future customer participation in some of these programs can leave the gas distribution operations subsidiaries with pipeline capacity for which it has contracted but no longer has a need the state commissions in jurisdictions served by gas distribution operations are at various stages in addressing methods for recovering the cost of such capacity gas distribution operations is currently recovering or has the opportunity to recover the costs resulting from the unbundling of its services and believes that most of such future costs will be mitigated or recovered methodologies for mitigating or recovering these costs include the use of assets available from previous funding mechanisms incentive sharing mechanisms reducing levels of reserved pipeline capacity and mandatory assignment of pipeline capacity to alternative suppliers

columbia of ohio and the other signatory parties to the stipulation accepted the puco’s modifications nevertheless on may 14 2004 the occ filed a second application for rehearing therein the occ argued that the joint petitioners did not meet the statutory requirements for an application for rehearing and thus the puco’s rehearing order was unlawful the occ also argued that the rehearing order was void as it resulted from settlement negotiations from which the occ was excluded the occ also continued to challenge the puco’s treatment of offsystem sales and capacity release revenues and postinservice carrying charges and related deferrals

all nisource gas distribution operations companies have stateapproved recovery mechanisms that provide a means for full recovery of prudently incurred gas costs gas costs are treated as passthrough costs and have no impact on the net revenues recorded in the period the gas costs included in revenues are matched with the gas cost expense recorded in the period and the difference is recorded on the consolidated balance sheets to be included in future customer billings during times of unusually high gas prices throughput and net revenue may be adversely affected as customers may reduce their usage as a result of higher gas cost 

the gas distribution operations companies have pursued nontraditional revenue sources within the evolving natural gas marketplace these efforts include both the sale of products and services upstream of their service territory the sale of products and services in their service territories and gas supply cost incentive mechanisms for service to their core markets the upstream products are made up of transactions that occur between an individual gas distribution company and a buyer for the sales of unbundled or rebundled gas supply and capacity the onsystem services are offered by nisource to customers and include products such as the transportation and balancing of gas on the gas distribution operations company system the incentive mechanisms give the gas distribution operations companies an opportunity to share in the savings created from such things as gas purchase prices paid below an agreed upon benchmark and its ability to reduce pipeline capacity charges the treatment of the revenues generated from these types of transactions vary by operating company with some sharing the benefits with customers and others using these revenues to mitigate transition costs occurring as the result of customer choice programs described above under “regulatory matters” 

capital expenditures and other investing activities the gas distribution operations segment’s net capital expenditure program was 2252 million in 2004 and is projected to be approximately 2553 million in 2005 the increase is primarily for modernizing and upgrading facilities capital expenditures required to provide service to new customers totaled approximately 848 million in 2004 and are expected to be 925 million in 2005 

weather in general nisource calculates the weather related revenue variance based on changing customer demand driven by weather variance from normal heating degreedays normal is evaluated using heating degree days across the nisource distribution region while the temperature base for measuring heating degreedays ie the estimated average daily temperature at which heating load begins varies slightly across the region the nisource composite measurement is based on 62 degrees in 2003 nisource changed its definition of normal heating degreedays using weather information from the average of 30 years ended 2001 this resulted in a decrease in normal heating degreedays of about 35 

weather in the gas distribution operations service territories for 2004 was approximately 2 warmer than normal and 5 warmer than 2003 decreasing net revenues by approximately 33 million for the year ended december 31 2004 compared to 2003 

in 2003 weather in the gas distribution operations service territories was approximately 4 colder than normal and 8 colder than 2002 increasing net revenues by approximately 60 million for the year ended december 31 2003 compared to 2002 

throughput total volumes sold and transported for the year ended december 31 2004 were 8985 million dekatherms mmdth compared to 8762 mmdth for 2003 this increase was primarily due to higher offsystem industrial and transportation sales partially offset by reduced residential and commercial sales as a result of warmer weather in 2004 as compared with 2003

total volumes sold and transported for the year ended december 31 2003 were 8762 mmdth compared to 9242 mmdth for 2002 this reduction was primarily due to a decrease in offsystem sales as a result of fewer market opportunities 

net revenues net revenues for 2004 were 14406 million down 360 million from 2003 mainly as a result of decreased deliveries of natural gas to residential and commercial customers amounting to approximately 33 million due to warmer weather during the first and fourth quarters of 2004 compared to 2003 additionally revenues decreased due to lower revenues from contract cost reduction programs reduced sales of retail products and releases of capacity amounting to 234 million and reduced revenue from gas cost incentives of 97 million these reductions in revenues were partially offset by an increase in residential customers representing higher revenues of approximately 85 million for 2004 as compared to 2003 and higher regulatory strategy net revenues of 258 million from the stipulation agreement granted for columbia of ohio and the recovery for conservation measures granted to bay state 

net revenues for 2003 were 14766 million up 878 million from 2002 mainly as a result of increased deliveries of natural gas to residential commercial and industrial customers of approximately 60 million due to colder weather during the first quarter of 2003 increased revenues of 86 million from offsystem sales and contract cost reduction arrangements partially offset by lower gas cost incentives and higher cost trackers and gross receipts taxes generally offset in operating expenses 

operating income for the twelve months ended december 31 2004 operating income for the gas distribution operations segment was 4403 million a decrease of 661 million compared to the same period in 2003 the decrease was the result of lower net revenue mentioned above and higher operating expenses of 301 million due to an increase in group insurance and outside services expenses of 67 million and depreciation expense of 44 million in addition the comparable 2003 period was favorably impacted by insurance recoveries and accrual adjustments of approximately 142 million both the 2004 and the 2003 periods benefited from lower uncollectible accounts resulting from the approval of the bad debt tracker for columbia of ohio in the fourth quarter of 2003 

for the twelve months ended december 31 2003 operating income for the gas distribution operations segment was 5064 million an increase of 473 million over the same period in 2002 the increase was the result of higher net revenue mentioned above the approval of a bad debt tracker for columbia of ohio for the recovery 252 million of previously uncollected accounts receivable and reduced administrative and employee related expenses of 145 million these benefits to operating income were offset in part by increased bad debt expense of 259 million higher pension and postretirement expenses of 98 million and 224 million of insurance recoveries for environmental expenses recognized in the 2002 period

proposed millennium pipeline project the proposed millennium pipeline project millennium in which columbia transmission is participating and will serve as developer and operator will provide access to a number of supply and storage basins and the dawn ontario trading hub the project is now being marketed in two phases phase 1 of the project is to begin at a proposed interconnect with the empire state pipeline empire an existing pipeline that originates at the canadian border and extends easterly towards syracuse empire would construct a lateral pipeline southward to connect with millennium near corning ny millennium would extend eastward to an interconnect with algonquin gas transmission at ramapo ny as currently planned phase 2 would cross the hudson river linking to the new york city metropolitan market 

on september 19 2002 the ferc issued its order granting final certificate authority for the original millennium project and specified that millennium may not begin construction until certain environmental and other conditions are met one such condition impacting what is now being marketed as phase 2 of the project is compliance with the coastal zone management act which is administered by the state of new york’s department of state nydos nydos has determined that the hudson river crossing plan is not consistent with the act millennium’s appeal of that decision to the us department of commerce was denied millennium filed an appeal of the us department of commerce ruling relating to the project’s hudson river crossing plan in the us federal district court on february 13 2004 the procedural schedule calls for all briefings to be completed by the end of 2005 

during the second quarter of 2004 a nisource affiliate purchased an additional interest in the project nisource is finalizing plans to transfer this interest to other sponsors in the first half of 2005 during the third quarter of 2004 keyspan millennium llc subsidiary of keyspan corporation purchased the interest of westcoast energy enterprises us inc and westcoast energy us llc subsidiaries of duke energy corporation the other sponsors are columbia transmission and mcnic millennium company subsidiary of dte energy company 

hardy storage project in november 2004 columbia transmission and a subsidiary of piedmont natural gas company inc piedmont reached an agreement to jointly develop a major new underground natural gas storage field to help meet increased market demand for natural gas in the eastern united states 

columbia transmission and piedmont have formed hardy storage company llc hardy storage to develop a natural gas storage field from a depleted natural gas production field in west virginia columbia transmission and piedmont each have a 50 percent equity interest in the project and columbia transmission will serve as operator of the facilities 

an open season for hardy storage conducted in early 2004 resulted in full subscription of the project’s storage capacity under longterm firm contracts the field which will have the capacity to store approximately 12 billion cubic feet bcf of natural gas is planned to begin service in november 2007 and will ultimately deliver 176 mmdth per day of firm storage service to the four customers subscribing for hardy storage capacity these customers have also signed longterm firm agreements with columbia transmission for transportation capacity to deliver gas from hardy storage to their markets columbia transmission will expand its natural gas transmission system to create this capacity 

hardy storage and columbia transmission anticipate filing the necessary applications for the projects with the ferc in 2005 with plans to begin construction later that year service from both projects is expected to be available in 2007 

regulatory matters on february 11 2004 the ferc issued an order regarding the annual electric power cost adjustment epca filing which upheld columbia transmission’s ability to fully recover its electric costs but required columbia transmission to implement a separate epca rate to recover from specific customers the electric power costs incurred by a newly expanded electricpowered compressor station the order also limits columbia transmission’s ability to prospectively discount its epca rates on december 22 2004 the ferc issued an order affirming

columbia transmission’s right to recover its actual electric costs and removed the obligation to make a separate filing to recover these costs from specific customers the ferc permitted columbia transmission to revisit the method for recovering the costs in a new filing management does not believe this order will have a material financial impact 

on april 14 2004 the ferc issued an order accepting columbia transmission’s retainage adjustment mechanism ram filing and approving the full recovery of gas required in system operations the ferc will permit parties to pursue certain issues raised in the 2003 filing in connection with consideration of columbia transmission’s 2004 ram filing which became effective april 1 2004 and is currently pending 

restructuring since 2000 nisource has implemented restructuring initiatives to streamline its operations and realize efficiencies from the acquisition of columbia the restructuring activities were primarily associated with reductions in headcount and facility exit costs 

in connection with these restructuring initiatives a total of approximately 1600 management professional administrative and technical positions throughout all nisource segments have been identified for elimination as of december 31 2004 approximately 1560 employees throughout all nisource segments had been terminated of whom approximately 13 employees were terminated during 2004 payments made in 2004 in respect of restructured items within gas transmission and storage operations was 29 million additionally during 2004 the restructuring reserve was increased by 16 million related to previous restructuring initiatives due to adjustments in estimated costs and an accrual for vacant office space the liability associated with these restructuring initiatives at december 31 2004 and 2003 was 58 million and 71 million respectively with 50 million related to facility exit costs at december 31 2004 

environmental matters currently various environmental matters impact the gas transmission and storage operations segment as of december 31 2004 a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions refer to note 17g “environmental matters” in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the gas transmission and storage operations 

capital expenditures and other investing activities the gas transmission and storage operations segment’s capital expenditure program was 1333 million in 2004 and is projected to be approximately 2063 million in 2005 the increase is due to increased expenditures for pipeline integrity related work as well as for the millennium and hardy storage initiatives the pipeline integrity expenditures are primarily for modernizing and upgrading facilities and complying with the requirements of the us department of transportation’s dot recently issued integrity management rule the dot integrity management rule requires that high consequence areas on transmission lines be assessed and remediated if required within a 10year period beginning december 2002 compliance will entail extensive assessment including pipeline modifications to allow for testing devices and facility replacement depending on test results new business initiatives totaled approximately 176 million in 2004 and are projected to be 468 million in 2005 

throughput columbia transmission’s throughput consists of transportation and storage services for ldcs and other customers within its market area which covers portions of northeastern midatlantic midwestern and southern states and the district of columbia throughput for columbia gulf reflects mainline transportation services from rayne louisiana to leach kentucky and shorthaul transportation services from the gulf of mexico to rayne louisiana crossroads serves customers in northern indiana and ohio and granite state provides service in new hampshire maine and massachusetts 

throughput for the gas transmission and storage operations segment totaled 11727 mmdth for 2004 compared to 12389 mmdth in 2003 the decrease of 662 mmdth was primarily due to slightly warmer weather in 2004 versus 2003 the continued decline of offshore natural gas production and other nonweather factors

throughput for the gas transmission and storage operations segment totaled 12389 mmdth for 2003 compared to 13143 mmdth in 2002 the decrease of 754 mmdth was primarily due to lower deliveries to dual fueled electric power generators which chose not to operate during 2003 when gas prices were exceptionally high additionally the continued decline of offshore natural gas production contributed to the decrease in throughput 

net revenues net revenues were 8326 million for 2004 a decrease of 47 million from 2003 the decrease was due to lower storage and transportation revenues of 58 million this resulted from the expiration of firm service contracts for both columbia transmission and columbia gulf on october 31 2004 which represented approximately 60 of gas transmission and storage operations net annual revenues based upon new commitments gas transmission and storage operations is projecting a reduction of approximately 40 million in annual revenues under the replacement contracts which represent approximately 5 of total segment revenues this reduction is projected to be partially offset by increased revenues resulting from remarketing efforts and new firm contracts 

net revenues were 8373 million for 2003 a decrease of 371 million from 2002 the decrease was primarily due to 93 million of lower interruptible service revenues and 104 million of lower firm service revenues the decline in interruptible revenues was due to higher use of capacity by firm customers resulting in less capacity available for interruptible services firm service revenues were reduced due to actions taken to alleviate late season deliverability limitations in the pipeline’s eastern storage fields the limitations resulted from the cumulative effect of facility outages that restricted eastern storage field inventory a work stoppage that extended the outages and abovenormal demand on storage withdrawals due to sustained cold weather in addition storage and transportation revenues decreased 135 million primarily due to reduced deliveries to power generating facilities 

operating income operating income of 3631 million in 2004 decreased 357 million from 2003 while net revenue decreased 47 million as discussed above operating expenses increased 310 million due primarily to the 2003 period being favorably impacted by an 110 million reduction in a reserve for environmental expenditures a 66 million reversal of a legal reserve related to a lawsuit settled in 2003 a 30 million reversal of a franchise tax reserve and a 23 million gain on the sale of certain assets for the year 2004 pension expense increased by 57 million and depreciation expense increased by 28 million as compared to the 2003 period 

operating income of 3988 million in 2003 increased 05 million from 2002 the 371 million decline in revenues discussed above was offset by a 125 million reduction in employeerelated and administrative expense an improvement to income of 110 million from a reduction in a reserve for environmental expenditures and a 66 million reversal of a litigation reserve relating to a lawsuit that was settled in the second quarter of 2003 the 2002 period was favorably impacted by a reduction in a reserve for environmental expenditures of 100 million a 100 million reduction in reserves related to unaccountedfor gas offset by 148 million of increased expenses related to nisource’s reorganization initiatives and other employeerelated costs and 87 million related to the recognition of a reserve related to a longterm note receivable

capital expenditures and other investing activities the electric operations segment’s capital expenditure program was 1540 million in 2004 and is projected to be approximately 1281 million in 2005 this reduction in the capital expenditure budget is mainly due to a continued reduction in estimated expenditures for nox compliance expenditures for 2004 included improvements related to the operational integrity of generation transmission and distribution assets expenditures related to environmental compliance nox reduction and additions to electric distribution systems related to new business estimated expenditures for 2005 are approximately 31 million for the nox reduction program the remaining expenditures are for new business initiatives and maintenance programs 

sales electric operations sales were 173675 gwh for the year 2004 a decrease of 10717 gwh compared to 2003 the decrease in sales resulted from reduced wholesale transaction sales and cooler weather in the third quarter of 2004 partially offset by increased nonweather related usage and customer count although cooling degree days cdd were up slightly in 2004 over 2003 the increases occurred in may and june while the cdd were down in the months of july and august which are the months when the effect of cdd on usage is greater 

electric operations sales were 184392 gwh for the year 2003 a decrease of 3367 gwh compared to 2002 the decrease in sales resulted from cooler weather during the summer cooling season partially offset by increases in nonweather related usage and increased customer count 

net revenues electric operations net revenues were 7602 million for 2004 an increase of 316 million from 2003 primarily as a result of increased revenue from environmental trackers amounting to 147 million increased nonweather related usage and customer count of 171 million and the effect of regulatory rate refunds in the comparable 2003 period of 124 million the above increase in net revenues was partially offset by cooler weather compared to the prior year of approximately 6 million 

electric operations net revenues were 7286 million for 2003 a decrease of 398 million from 2002 primarily as a result of 240 million in additional credits issued representing a full year of credits pertaining to the iurc electric rate review settlement and the unfavorable impact of cooler weather of approximately 22 million these decreases were partially offset by increases in nonweatherrelated usage and customer growth 

operating income operating income for 2004 was 3062 million an increase of 387 million from 2003 the increase was primarily a result of the abovementioned increases in revenues and a reduction in other taxes of 271 million partially offset by higher operation and maintenance expenses of 186 million other taxes decreased due mainly to a 281 million reduction in estimated property tax accruals operation and maintenance expenses increased due mainly to incremental miso administrative expenses of 46 million higher employee and administrative expenses of 38 million 33 million recorded from the early extinguishment of certain mediumterm notes and higher outside services expense of 16 million in addition a 38 million adjustment to employee insurance reserves in 2003 contributed to the yearoveryear increase in operating expenses

however the study includes many estimates and assumptions for the 40year estimated useful life of the facility changes in these estimates and assumptions such as forward prices for electricity and gas volatility in the market etc could result in a situation where total undiscounted net revenues are less than the carrying value of the facility which would result in a writedown that could be significant 

during the second quarter of 2003 pei’s wholly owned subsidiary whiting energy llc purchased the whiting clean energy plant from a special purpose lessor entity and the facility is accounted for as an owned asset 

environmental matters currently various environmental matters impact other operations segment as of december 31 2004 a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions refer to note 17g “environmental matters” in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the other operations segment 

net revenues for the year ended 2004 net operating revenues were 270 million an increase of 110 million from 2003 the increase in net revenues was primarily due to a 51 million settlement of a lawsuit in the third quarter of 2004 and increased income from equity investments of 25 million 

for the year ended 2003 net operating revenues were 160 million an increase of 22 million from 2002 the increase in net revenues was primarily due to losses of 117 million recorded in 2002 associated with nisource’s decision to scale back its gas trading business slightly offset by losses of 16 million recorded in 2003 associated with the power trading business as a result of lower volatility in the market and decreased volumes sold and a decrease in whiting clean energy net revenues of 70 million

generally strongest in the residential and commercial markets of kentucky southern ohio central pennsylvania and western virginia where electric rates are primarily driven by lowcost coalfired generation in ohio and pennsylvania gas on gas competition is also common gas competes with fuel oil and propane in the new england markets mainly due to the installed base of fuel oil and propanebased heating which over time has comprised a declining percentage of the overall market restructuring since 2000 nisource has implemented restructuring initiatives to streamline its operations and realize efficiencies from the acquisition of columbia the restructuring activities were primarily associated with reductions in headcount and facility exit costs in connection with these restructuring initiatives a total of approximately 1600 management professional administrative and technical positions throughout all nisource segments have been identified for elimination as of

operations’ residential and small commercial and industrial customers selected an alternate supplier gas distribution operations continues to offer choice ® opportunities through regulatory initiatives in all of its jurisdictions while choice ® programs generally provide all customer classes with the opportunity to obtain gas supplies from alternative merchants gas distribution operations expects to play a substantial role in supplying gas commodity services to its customers for the foreseeable future customer participation in some of these programs can leave the gas distribution operations subsidiaries with pipeline capacity for which it has contracted but no longer has a need the state commissions in jurisdictions served by gas distribution operations are at various stages in addressing methods for recovering the cost of such capacity gas distribution operations is currently recovering or has the opportunity to recover the costs resulting from the unbundling of its services and believes that most of such future costs will be mitigated or recovered methodologies for mitigating or recovering these costs include the use of assets available from previous funding mechanisms incentive sharing mechanisms reducing levels of reserved pipeline capacity and mandatory assignment of pipeline capacity to alternative suppliers through october 2004

natural gas competition open access to natural gas supplies over interstate
pipelines and the deregulation of the commodity price of gas has led to
tremendous change in the energy markets which continue to evolve during the
past few years local distribution company ldc customers and marketers began
to purchase gas directly from producers and marketers and an open competitive
market for gas supplies emerged this separation or unbundling of the
transportation and other services offered by pipelines and ldcs allows customers
to select services independent from the purchase of the commodity nisources
gas distribution operations subsidiaries are involved in programs that provide
residential customers the opportunity to purchase their natural gas requirements
from third parties and use the nisource gas distribution operations subsidiaries
for transportation services

electric competition in 1996 the federal energy regulatory commission ferc
ordered that all public utilities owning controlling or operating electric
transmission lines file nondiscriminatory openaccess tariffs and offer
wholesale electricity suppliers and marketers the same transmission service they
provide to themselves in 1997 ferc accepted for filing northern indianas
openaccess transmission tariff and issued an opinion on december 31 2002 in
december 1999 ferc issued order 2000 a final rule addressing the formation and
operation of regional transmission organizations rtos see item 7 electric
operations  regulatory matters the rule was intended to eliminate pricing
inequities in the provisioning of wholesale transmission service nisource does
not believe that compliance with the new rules will be material to its future
earnings

nisources other operations subsidiaries also experience competition for energy
sales and related services from third party providers nisource meets these
challenges through innovative programs aimed at providing energy products and
services at competitive prices while also providing new services that are
responsive to the evolving energy market and customer requirements

4       united states of america ex rel jack j grynberg v columbia gas
         transmission corp et al us district court ed louisiana

         the plaintiff filed a complaint in 1997 under the false claims act on
         behalf of the united states of america against approximately seventy
         pipelines including columbia gulf and columbia transmission the
         plaintiff claimed that the defendants had submitted false royalty
         reports to the government or caused others to do so by mismeasuring
         the volume and heating content of natural gas produced on federal land
         and indian lands the plaintiffs original complaint was dismissed
         without prejudice for misjoinder of parties and for failing to plead
         fraud with specificity the plaintiff then filed over sixtyfive new
         false claims act complaints against over 330 defendants in numerous
         federal courts one of those complaints was filed in the federal
         district court for the eastern district of louisiana against columbia
         and thirteen affiliated entities

         plaintiffs second complaint filed in 1997 repeats the
         mismeasurement claims previously made and adds valuation claims
         alleging that the defendants have undervalued natural gas for royalty
         purposes in various ways including sales to affiliated entities at
         artificially low prices most of the grynberg cases were transferred to
         federal court in wyoming in 1999

         this case is still in the discovery process

5       price et al v gas pipelines et al stevens county court kansas

         behalf of all domestic producers and all state taxing authorities
         against over 200 natural gas measurers mostly natural gas pipelines
         the plaintiffs allege that since january 1 1974 defendants have
         mismeasured the volume andor heating content of natural gas from
         nonfederal oil and gas leases and as a result caused substantial
         royalty underpayments the allegations in this case are in most
         respects identical to the allegations in the grynberg case described
         above but these allegations apply to all nonfederal leases
         plaintiffs have filed their fourth amendment petition in which they
         narrow the number of defendants now down to only 53 and the
         geographic scope of their allegations from a nationwide class to
         actions occurring in kansas wyoming and colorado only plaintiffs
         have also filed a companion suit against the same defendants named in
         the fourth amended petition alleging mismeasurement relating to btu

         costs and not paying a fair value for the gas produced from their
         leases plaintiffs seek the alleged royalty underpayment and punitive
         damages claiming that columbia natural resources fraudulently concealed
         the deduction of postproduction charges in february 2004 the court
         certified the case as a class action that includes any person who
         after january 1 1980 received or is due royalties from columbia
         natural resources and its predecessors or successors on lands lying
         within the boundary of the state of west virginia all individuals
         corporations agencies departments or instrumentalities of the united
         states of america are excepted from the class although nisource sold
         columbia natural resources in 2003 it remains obligated to manage this
         litigation and also remains at least partly liable for any damages
         awarded to the plaintiffs the company intends to appeal the decision

opportunities for nisources businesses increased competition in deregulated
energy markets dealings with third parties over whom nisource has no control
actual operating experience of acquired assets the regulatory process
regulatory and legislative changes changes in general economic capital and
commodity market conditions and counterparty credit risk many of which risks
are beyond the control of nisource in addition the relative contributions to
profitability by each segment and the assumptions underlying the
forwardlooking statements relating thereto may change over time

executive summary

nisource generates nearly all of its net revenue through the sale distribution
and storage of natural gas and the generation transmission and distribution of
electricity which are rate regulated a significant portion of nisources
operations most notably in the gas distribution gas transportation and
electric businesses is subject to seasonal fluctuations in sales during the
heating season which is primarily from november through march and the cooling
season which is primarily from june through september net revenues from gas
and electric sales and transportation services are more significant than other
months

as a regulated company nisource is exposed to regulatory risk currently
nisource is in discussions with various regulatory bodies this past year
nisource implemented several creative agreements by working collaboratively with
regulators and other key stakeholders which provided value for our customers
and shareholders ohio regulators have approved a surcharge to begin in april
2004 that will allow columbia of ohio to recover previously uncollected bad
debts and will allow paymenttroubled customers to have the opportunity to
participate in customer choicesm programs for the first time columbia gas of

however the ohio regulators have recently decided to modify parts of a
regulatory stipulation designed to enhance the customer choicesm program and
provide columbia of ohio customers rate certainty  the company is likely to
seek rehearing on the components that have been modified columbia gas of
pennsylvania inc cpa received regulatory approval in october to recover
certain costs of an affordable payment plan to lowincome gas customers with
longterm bill payment problems this agreement should reduce cpas arrearages
and bad debt writeoffs going forward northern indiana public service company
northern indiana received approval from the indiana utility regulatory
commission iurc in 2003 to recover costs associated with environmental
compliance programs for nitrogen oxide nox pollutionreduction equipment at
the companys generating stations all regulatory matters are discussed in the
segments section of the management discussion and analysis

nisource has had many accomplishments in the current and recent years the
divestiture of major noncore businesses which allowed nisource to reduce debt
and business risk and focus on the core regulated assets and the reduction of
the dividend in november 2003 has helped nisource affirm its investment grade
credit rating with a stable outlook in addition nisource reduced interest
expense during 2003 by 517 million as compared to last year or 10 percent by
retiring 128 billion in debt and reissuing another 135 billion of debt at a
lower rate nisource also downsized the revolving credit facility by 500
million and retired 345 million in mandatory redeemable preferred securities
which further reduced fixed charges nisource currently anticipates that its
125 billion 3year credit facility expiring march 23 2004 will be replaced
during the first quarter of 2004 and will be split between a 364day facility
and a 3year facility

nisource also completed the previously announced divestitures of noncore
assets including the gas exploration and production unit pei holdings incs
pei steelrelated cogeneration assets and the telecommunications business
these sales generated about 305 million after taxes plus the elimination of
roughly 274 million of debt that was assumed by the buyers this strengthened
the balance sheet and lowered nisources risk profile nisource will capitalize
on the stable portfolio of virtually 100 percent regulated and strategically
located gas and electric businesses

in addition nisource adopted a new organizational structure that will focus on
the regulated core businesses of strategically located gas and electric
operations that generate virtually 100 of the companys operating income
through this focus on operations and a new organizational structure nisource
has been able to hold the line on operation and maintenance costs despite
increases in employee benefits and pension costs through these and many other
efforts nisource was able to deliver income from continuing operations of 164
per share for the year ended december 31 2003

going forward nisource will continue to build value and customer trust by
capitalizing on its superregional utility and pipeline operations nisource
will focus on continuing to standardize its operations and focus on
predictability and reliability continuing to deliver the best possible service
at the lowest cost continuing to develop innovative ways to help our customers
manage heating bills and gas price volatility with products such as its
fixedprice option continuing to find ways to control the cost of generating
electricity and pursuing projects that will bring longterm attractively priced
gas supplies to the market

finally nisource has always been committed to accurate and complete financial
reporting  and requires a strong commitment to ethical behavior by its
employees nisources senior management takes an active role in the development
of the form 10k in addition nisource will continue our mandatory ethics
training program in which employees at every level and in every function of our
organization participate

nisource inc

including results from discontinued operations and a change in accounting
nisource reported 2003 net income of 852 million or 33 cents per share 2002
net income of 3725 million or 177 per share and 2162 million or 105
per share for 2001 earnings per share are not comparable because of 131
million shares issued upon the settlement of forward equity agreements in
february 2003 and an equity offering of 414 million shares that was completed
in november 2002

net revenues

total consolidated net revenues gross revenues less cost of sales for the
twelve months ended december 31 2003 were 30603 million a 106 million
decrease compared with 2002 items that favorably impacted the year included
colder weather during the heating season in the first quarter amounting to 601
million and modest increases in nontraditional and nonweather related volume
of 154 million these favorable items were offset by reduced electric revenue
of 219 million due to cooler weather during the summer cooling season lower
interruptible service revenues and firm service revenues of 197 million in the
gas transmission and storage operations segment due to measures undertaken
during the first quarter period of sustained colderthannormal weather a
decrease in storage and transportation revenues of 135 million due mainly to
reduced deliveries to power generating facilities and credits totaling 240
million pertaining to the indiana utility regulatory commission iurc electric
rate review settlement

total consolidated net revenues gross revenues less cost of sales for the
twelve months ended december 31 2002 were 30709 million a 559 million
decrease compared with 2001 the decrease in revenues was primarily attributable
to reduced offsystem sales incentive programs and nonweatherrelated gas
sales totaling 415 million credits totaling 281 million pertaining to the
iurc electric rate review settlement 129 million from scaling back the energy
trading operations and an 85 million reduction in gains on the sales of
storage base gas offsetting the decrease was a 366 million impact of
favorable weather due to a much colder fall heating season which increased
natural gas sales and deliveries and a warmer summer cooling season that
positively impacted electric sales

expenses

operating expenses were 19440 million in 2003 a 253 million increase from
2002 operating expense increases experienced during the year included 285
million in pension and postretirement expenses an increase in uncollectible
accounts receivable expense amounting to 213 million and increased operating
tax expense of 123 million consisting primarily of increased property taxes
expense reductions for 2003 include 275 million in reduced administrative and
employeerelated expense and the approval of a bad debt tracker for columbia of
ohio for the recovery of 252 million of previously uncollected accounts
receivable in addition nisource sold columbia service partners inc for a
gain of 166 million in third quarter of 2003 and midtex gas storage for a gain
of 75 million in the fourth quarter of 2003 the 2002 period included 245
million of insurance recoveries for environmental expenses a reduction in
estimated sales taxes of 114 million that occurred in 2002 related to sales of
natural gas to customers of a subsidiary previously engaged in the retail and
wholesale gas marketing business a reduction in a reserve for environmental
expenditures of 100 million and a 100 million reversal in reserves related
to unaccountedfor gas offset by 148 million of increased expenses related to
nisources reorganization initiatives and other employeerelated costs and 87
million related to the recognition of a reserve related to a longterm note
receivable

operating expenses of 19187 million for 2002 decreased 2402 million over
2001 a portion of the decrease was attributable to a 1230 million reduction
in operation and maintenance expenses primarily due to lower employeerelated
support services and facilities expenses of 354 million resulting from
reorganization initiatives insurance recoveries of environmental expenses
totaling 245 million a reversal of 303 million in reserves for estimated
taxes and environmental expenditures and a reduction of 168 million from
reduced uncollectible customer accounts and other customerrelated expenses the
2001 period was unfavorably impacted by the 155 million litigation settlement
related to market hub partners lp mhp also contributing to the decrease
was the elimination of 931 million of goodwill amortization as a result of a
financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standard that affected
goodwill amortization beginning january 1 2002 and 271 million primarily from
gains on the sales of nisources utility linelocating and marking business and
a significant portion of tpcs gas trading contracts

other income deductions

other income deductions in 2003 reduced income 4564 million compared to a
reduction of 5352 million in 2002 interest expense net decreased 517
million from 2002 primarily due to lower shortterm and longterm interest rates
and a decrease in total debt of 191 million from december 31 2002 minority
interest consisting of dividends paid on companyobligated mandatorily
redeemable preferred securities associated with the corporate premium income
equity securities corporate pies was 25 million in 2003 compared to 204
million in 2002 as a result of the settlement and remarketing of the corporate
pies in february 2003

other income deductions in 2002 reduced income 5352 million compared to a
reduction of 6103 million in 2001 interest expense net decreased 756
million from 2001 primarily due to debt reduction during 2002 of 14 billion
resulting from proceeds from the sale of 414 million shares of common stock
approximating 7349 million and the sales of iwcr and smp lower shortterm
interest rates also contributed to the decrease minority interest consisting
of dividends paid on companyobligated mandatorily redeemable preferred
securities associated with the corporate pies was 204 million in both 2002
and 2001

income taxes

income taxes increased 153 million in 2003 as compared with 2002 and increased
523 million in 2002 over 2001 primarily as a result of higher pretax income
in each succeeding period the effective income tax rates were 355 355  and
466 in 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively the decrease in the effective tax
rate after 2002 was primarily due to discontinuing the amortization of goodwill
in 2002 see note 9 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for
additional information

discontinued operations

discontinued operations reflected an aftertax loss of 3317 million or a loss
of 128 per share in 2003 compared to a loss of 256 million or loss of 12
cents per share in 2002 and income of 212 million or 10 cents per share in
2001 in 2003 an aftertax loss of 3012 million was related to the sale of
nisources exploration and production properties cer while a loss of 291
million was recognized on the sale of six pei subsidiaries and a loss of 13
million on the sale of columbia transmission communications corporation
transcom the 2002 results were unfavorably impacted by a noncash charge of
513 million after tax that was recognized as a result of the continuing
depressed market for dark fiber and nisources decision to exit the
telecommunications business 2001 results included income of 304 million from
cer partly offset by a loss of 143 million from transcom which included an
impairment charge of 57 million aftertax nisource accounted for cer six of
the pei subsidiaries transcom and water utility assets that were sold in 2002
as discontinued operations

change in accounting

the change in accounting in 2003 of 88 million netoftax resulted from the
cumulative effect of adopting the financial accounting standards board statement
on asset retirement obligations the change in accounting in 2001 is a result of
the adoption of the financial accounting standards board statement on derivative
accounting

liquidity and capital resources

generally cash flow from operations has provided sufficient liquidity to meet
operating requirements a significant portion of nisources operations most
notably in the gas distribution gas transportation and electric businesses is
subject to seasonal fluctuations in cash flow during the heating season which
is primarily from november through march cash receipts from gas sales and
transportation services typically exceed cash requirements during the summer
months cash on hand together with the seasonal increase in cash flows from the
electric business during the summer cooling season and external shortterm and
longterm financing is used to purchase gas to place in storage for heating
season deliveries perform necessary maintenance of facilities make capital
improvements in plant and expand service into new areas

net cash from continuing operations for the twelve months ended december 31
2003 was 4729 million cash used for working capital was 4307 million
principally driven by increased gas inventories and gas exchange receivables and
decreased exchange gas payables partly offset by lower accounts receivable and
the timing of the recovery of gas and fuel costs

facility that expires on march 23 2004 was amended to allow for an increase in
aggregate letters of credit outstanding from 1500 million to 5000 million

2002 the corporate pies remarketing the sale of the exploration and production
properties the sale of peis assets and net cash flow from continuing
operations nisource currently anticipates that its 125 billion 3year credit

ratings outlook for nisource and its subsidiaries is now stable on june 30
2003 fitch ratings affirmed their bbb senior unsecured rating for nisource and
the bbb rating for columbia fitch also lowered the rating of northern indiana

increased collateral if the credit ratings of nisource or certain of its
subsidiaries are rated below bbb by standard and poors or baa3 by moodys the
collateral requirement from a downgrade below the ratings trigger levels would
amount to approximately 50 million to 100 million in addition to agreements
with ratings triggers there are other electric or gas trading agreements that
contain adequate assurance or material adverse change provisions the
collateral requirement for those agreements would amount to approximately 480
million to 530 million

for 2003 capital expenditures were 5725 million an increase of 450 million
over 2002 the gas distribution operations segments capital program in 2003
included business initiatives to extend service to new areas and develop future
markets through new services that may be added to the existing business and to
create a potential new pool of customers as well as expenditures to ensure
safe reliable and improved service to customers and modernize and upgrade
facilities the gas transmission and storage operations segment invested
primarily in modernizing and upgrading facilities with some expenditure for new
business initiatives the electric operations segment capital program included
improvements related to the operational integrity of generation transmission
and distribution assets expenditures related to environmental compliance
regarding nitrogen oxide nox reduction and additions to electric distribution
systems related to new business while the nox expenditures are being funded
with cash from operations a portion will be recovered over time through the
northern indiana environmental tracker the other operations segment primarily
reflects capital spending for enterprisewide information technology
infrastructure improvements

for 2004 the projected capital program is expected to be 5186 million which
is a decrease of 9 or 539 million from capital expenditures in 2003 this
reduction in the capital expenditure budget is mainly due to a reduction in
estimated expenditures for nox compliance

pension funding

due to the upswing in the equity markets the fair value of nisources pension
fund assets has increased since september 30 2002 nisource expects market
returns to revert to normal levels as demonstrated in historical periods
however nisource may be required to provide additional funding for the pension
obligations if returns on plan assets fall short of the assumed 90 longterm
earnings rate assumption as a result of the increase in the fair value of the
plans assets nisource expects pension expense for 2004 to decrease
approximately 192 million from the amount recognized in 2003 see note 10 of
notes to the consolidated financial statements for more information

business nisources risk management policies and procedures continue to evolve
and are subject to ongoing review and modification

various analytical techniques are employed to measure and monitor nisources
market and credit risks including valueatrisk and instrument sensitivity to
market factors var var represents the potential loss or gain for an
instrument or portfolio from changes in market factors for a specified time
period and at a specified confidence level

nontrading risks

commodity price risk resulting from nontrading activities at nisources
rateregulated subsidiaries is limited since regulations allow recovery of
prudently incurred purchased power fuel and gas costs through the ratemaking
process if states should explore additional regulatory reform these
subsidiaries may begin providing services without the benefit of the traditional
ratemaking process and may be more exposed to commodity price risk

effective july 1 2002 tpc sold a significant portion of its net obligations
under its gas forward transaction portfolio physical storage inventory and
associated agreements to a third party beginning with the effective date of the
sale the primary remaining operations associated with tpc include commercial
and industrial gas sales including arranging supply power marketing and gas
supply associated with nisources single merchant cogeneration facility and
power trading with the exception of power trading and one remaining gas trading
transaction which expired in october 2002 since july 1 2002 the gasrelated
activities at tpc were no longer considered trading activities for accounting
purposes

nisource is exposed to interest rate risk as a result of changes in interest
rates on borrowings under revolving credit agreements and lines of credit which
have interest rates that are indexed to shortterm market interest rates at
december 31 2003 the combined borrowings outstanding under these facilities
totaled 6855 million nisource is also exposed to interest rate risk due to
changes in interest rates on fixedtovariable interest rate swaps that hedge
the fair value of longterm debt the principal amount of such longterm debt
subject to interest rate hedges at december 31 2003 was 11630 million based
upon average borrowings under agreements subject to fluctuations in shortterm
market interest rates during 2003 and 2002 an increase in shortterm interest
rates of 100 basis points 1 would have increased interest expense by 136
million and 175 million for the years 2003 and 2002 respectively

on july 22 2003 nisource entered into fixedtovariable interest rate swap
agreements in a notional amount of 5000 million with four counterparties with
an 11year term nisource will receive payments based upon a fixed 540
interest rate and pay a floating interest amount based on us 6month british
banker association bba libor plus an average of 078 per annum there was no
exchange of premium at the initial date of the swaps in addition each party
has the right to cancel the swaps on either july 15 2008 or july 15 2013 at

agreements in a notional amount of 100 million with two counterparties
columbia will receive payments based upon a fixed 742 interest rate and pay a
floating interest amount based on us 6month bba libor plus an average of

on either april 15 2008 or april 15 2013 at midmarket

on april 4 2003 columbia terminated a fixedtovariable interest rate swap
agreement in a notional amount of 1000 million nisource received a settlement
payment from the counterparty amounting to 82 million which is being
amortized as a reduction to interest expense over the remaining term of the
underlying debt

on september 3 2002 columbia entered into new fixedtovariable interest rate
swap agreements totaling 2815 million with three counterparties effective as
of september 5 2002 according to the agreements nisource will receive
payments based upon a fixed 732 interest rate and will pay a floating interest
amount based on us 6month bba libor plus 266 per annum there was no

due to the nature of the industry credit risk is a factor in many of nisources
business activities credit risk arises because of the possibility that a
customer supplier or counterparty will not be able or willing to fulfill its
obligations on a transaction on or before the settlement date for derivative
contracts such as interest rate swaps credit risk arises when counterparties
are obligated to pay nisource the positive fair value or receivable resulting
from the execution of contract terms exposure to credit risk is measured in
terms of both current and potential exposure current credit exposure is
generally measured by the notional or principal value of financial instruments
and direct credit substitutes such as commitments standby letters of credit
and guarantees because many of nisources exposures vary with changes in market
prices nisource also estimates the potential credit exposure over the remaining
term of transactions through statistical analyses of market prices in
determining exposure nisource considers collateral and master netting
agreements which are used to reduce individual counterparty credit risk

trading risks

prior to the july 1 2002 sale of the tpc gas marketing and trading contracts
nisources trading operations consisted of gas and powerrelated activities
beginning july 1 2002 with the exception of one remaining gas trading
transaction which expired in october 2002 the trading activities of tpc have
involved power only

the transactions associated with nisources power trading operations give rise
to various risks including market risks resulting from the potential loss from
adverse changes in the market prices of electricity the power trading
operations market and trade overthecounter contracts for the purchase and sale
of electricity those contracts within the power trading portfolio that require
settlement by physical delivery are often net settled in accordance with
industry standards

fair value represents the amount at which willing parties would transact an
armslength transaction fair value is determined by applying a current price to
the associated contract volume for a commodity the current price is derived
from one of three sources including actively quoted markets such as the new york
mercantile exchange nymex other external sources including electronic
exchanges and overthecounter brokerdealer markets as well as financial
models such as the blackscholes option pricing model

traded on electronic exchanges and overthecounter contracts whose value is

market risk measurement

market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market
prices rates indices volatilities correlations or other market factors such
as liquidity will result in losses for a specified position or portfolio
nisource calculates a oneday var at a 95 confidence level for the power
trading group and the gas marketing group that utilize a variancecovariance
methodology based on the results of the var analysis the daily market exposure
for power trading on an average high and low basis was 04 million 13
million and effectively zero during 2003 respectively the daily market
exposure for the gas marketing and trading portfolios on an average high and
low basis was 03 million 05 million and 01 million during 2003
respectively prospectively management has set the var limits at 25 million
for power trading and 05 million for gas marketing exceeding the var limits
would result in management actions to reduce portfolio risk

refer to critical accounting policies of this item 7 and risk management
activities in notes 1 and 7 respectively of notes to the consolidated
financial statements for further discussion of nisources risk management

off balance sheet arrangements

nisource has issued guarantees that support up to approximately 15 billion of
commodityrelated payments for its current subsidiaries involved in energy
marketing and power trading and to satisfy requirements under forward gas sales
agreements of a former subsidiary these guarantees were provided to
counterparties in order to facilitate physical and financial transactions
involving natural gas and electricity to the extent liabilities exist under the
commodityrelated contracts subject to these guarantees such liabilities are
included in the consolidated balance sheets in addition nisource has other
guarantees purchase commitments operating leases lines of credit and letters
of credit outstanding refer to note 7 risk management activities and note 17
other commitments and contingencies for additional information about nisources
off balance sheet arrangements

northern indiana has a service agreement with pure air a general partnership
between air products and chemicals inc and first air partners lp under which
pure air provides scrubber services to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions for units
7 and 8 at the bailly generating station services under this contract commenced
on june 15 1992 and have current annual charges approximating 165 million
the agreement provides that assuming various performance standards are met by
pure air a termination payment would be due if northern indiana terminated the
agreement prior to the end of the twentyyear contract period

in addition nisource has sold certain accounts receivable nisources accounts
receivable programs qualify for sale accounting because they meet the conditions
specified in sfas no 140 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial
asset and extinguishments of liabilities in the agreements all transferred
assets have been isolated from the transferor and put presumptively beyond the
reach of the transferor and its creditors even in bankruptcy or other

critical accounting policies

nisource applies certain accounting policies based on the accounting
requirements discussed below that have had and may continue to have
significant impacts on nisources results of operations and consolidated balance
sheets

basis of accounting for rateregulated subsidiaries sfas no 71 accounting
for the effects of certain types of regulation sfas no 71 provides that
rateregulated subsidiaries account for and report assets and liabilities
consistent with the economic effect of the way in which regulators establish
rates if the rates established are designed to recover the costs of providing
the regulated service and if the competitive environment makes it probable that
such rates can be charged and collected nisources rateregulated subsidiaries
follow the accounting and reporting requirements of sfas no 71 certain
expenses and credits subject to utility regulation or rate determination
normally reflected in income are deferred on the balance sheet and are
recognized in income as the related amounts are included in service rates and
recovered from or refunded to customers the total amounts of regulatory assets
and liabilities reflected on the consolidated balance sheets were 9277 million
and 11990 million at december 31 2003 and 9532 million and 1568 million
at december 31 2002 respectively additionally refer to sfas no 143
accounting for asset retirement obligations under this item 7 heading titled
accounting changes and recently issued accounting pronouncements

in the event that regulation significantly changes the opportunity for nisource
to recover its costs in the future all or a portion of nisources regulated
operations may no longer meet the criteria for the application of sfas no 71
in such event a writedown of all or a portion of nisources existing
regulatory assets and liabilities could result if transition cost recovery is
approved by the appropriate regulatory bodies that would meet the requirements
under generally accepted accounting principles for continued accounting as
regulatory assets and liabilities during such recovery period the regulatory
assets and liabilities would be reported at the recoverable amounts if unable
to continue to apply the provisions of sfas no 71 nisource would be required
to apply the provisions of sfas no 101 regulated enterprises  accounting for
the discontinuation of application of fasb statement no 71 in managements
opinion nisources regulated subsidiaries will be subject to sfas no 71 for
the foreseeable future

certain of the regulatory assets reflected on nisources consolidated balance
sheets require specific regulatory action in order to be included in future
service rates although recovery of these amounts is not guaranteed nisource
believes that these costs meet the requirements for deferral as regulatory
assets under sfas no 71 regulatory assets requiring specific regulatory action
amounted to 1533 million at december 31 2003 if nisource determined that the
amounts included as regulatory assets were not recoverable a charge to income
would immediately be required to the extent of the unrecoverable amounts

accounting for risk management activities under sfas no 133 as amended the
accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended
use of the derivative and resulting designation unrealized and realized gains
and losses are recognized each period as components of other comprehensive
income earnings or regulatory assets and liabilities depending on the nature
of such derivatives for subsidiaries that utilize derivatives for cash flow
hedges the effective portions of the gains and losses are recorded to other
comprehensive income and are recognized in earnings concurrent with the
disposition of the hedged risks for fair value hedges the gains and losses are
recorded in earnings each period along with the change in the fair value of the
hedged item as a result of the ratemaking process the rateregulated
subsidiaries generally record gains and losses as regulatory liabilities or
assets and recognize such gains or losses in earnings when recovered in
revenues

nisource inc

in order for a derivative contract to be designated as a hedge the relationship
between the hedging instrument and the hedged item or transaction must be highly
effective the effectiveness test is performed at the inception of the hedge and
each reporting period thereafter throughout the period that the hedge is
designated any amounts determined to be ineffective are recorded currently in
earnings

although nisource applies some judgment in the assessment of hedge effectiveness
to designate certain derivatives as hedges the nature of the contracts used to
hedge the underlying risks is such that the correlation of the changes in fair
values of the derivatives and underlying risks is high nisource generally uses
nymex exchangetraded natural gas futures and options contracts and
overthecounter swaps based on published indices to hedge the risks underlying
its naturalgasrelated businesses nisource had 1668 million of price risk
management assets and 133 million of price risk management liabilities
primarily related to hedges at december 31 2003 the amount of unrealized gains
recorded to other comprehensive income was 917 million at december 31 2003

accounting for energy trading activities energy trading activities refers to
energy contracts entered into with the objective of generating profits on or
from exposure to shifts or changes in market prices nisource evaluates the
contracts of its trading operations in accordance with the criteria for
derivative contracts under sfas no 133 through 2002 contracts not meeting the
criteria under sfas no 133 were recorded at fair value under emerging issues
task force issue no 9810 accounting for energy trading and risk management
activities eitf no 9810

pursuant to eitf no 9810 when certain trading criteria are met energy
contracts including energyrelated contracts such as tolling transportation
and storage contracts should be accounted for at fair value marked to market
along with any related derivative contracts recognizing related gains and
losses currently in earnings in the october 2002 eitf meeting eitf no 9810
was rescinded and only contracts meeting the definition in sfas no 133 can be
marked to market refer to note 7 to the consolidated financial statement for
further information

while the assessment of fair values for nisources trading contracts have been
mainly based on pricing information for exchangetraded contracts
transportation and storage agreements related to gas trading deals entered into
prior to the cessation of gas trading activities were marked to fair value based
on the results of internal models no estimates of fair values on transportation
and storage contracts related to gas trading activities remained as of december
31 2002 due to the sale or expiration of all gastrading related agreements
during the year in addition power trading options were marked to fair value
through earnings based on internal calculations of fair value employing the
widelyused blackscholes option pricing model at december 31 2003 the fair
value of the marktofairvalue options outstanding was a loss of 15
million

at december 31 2003 nisources balance sheet contained 219 million of price
risk management assets and 234 million of price risk management liabilities
related to unrealized gains and losses on trading activities respectively

pensions and postretirement benefits nisource has defined benefit plans for
both pensions and other postretirement benefits the plans are accounted for
under sfas no 87 and sfas no 106 employers accounting for postretirement
benefits other than pensions the calculation of the net obligations and annual
expense related to the plans requires a significant degree of judgment regarding
the discount rates to be used in bringing the liabilities to present value
longterm returns on plan assets and employee longevity among other
assumptions due to the size of the plans and the longterm nature of the
associated liabilities changes in the assumptions used in the actuarial
estimates could have material impacts on the measurement of the net obligations
and annual expense recognition for further discussion of nisources pensions
and other postretirement benefits see note 10 of the notes to consolidated
financial statements

accounting changes and recently issued accounting pronouncements

statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 133 accounting for
derivative instruments and hedging activities as subsequently amended by sfas
no 137 sfas no 138 and sfas no 149 collectively referred to as sfas no
133 effective january 1 2001 nisource adopted the fasbs statement of
financial accounting standards sfas no 133 accounting for derivative
instruments and hedging activities as subsequently amended by sfas no 137
sfas no 138 and sfas 149 these statements establish accounting and reporting
standards for derivative instruments including certain derivative instruments
embedded in other contracts collectively referred to as derivatives and for
hedging activities sfas no 133 requires an entity to recognize all derivatives
as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and measure those
instruments at fair value if certain conditions are met a derivative may be
specifically designated as a a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair
value of a recognized asset or liability or an unrecognized firm commitment or
b a hedge of the exposure to variable cash flows of a forecasted transaction
the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the
intended use of the derivative and resulting designation

the adoption of sfas no 133 on january 1 2001 resulted in a cumulative
aftertax increase to net income of approximately 40 million and an aftertax
reduction to other comprehensive income oci of approximately 170 million
which was recognized in earnings during 2002 and 2001 the adoption also
resulted in the recognition of 1780 million of assets and 2128 million of
liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet additionally the adoption
resulted in the reduction of hedged risk basis of 38 million and the
reclassification of deferred revenue to oci of 179 million

eitf issue no 0203  issues involved in accounting for derivative contracts
held for trading purposes and contracts involved in energy trading and risk
management activities and eitf issue no 9810  accounting for contracts
involved in energy trading and risk management activities on october 25 2002
the eitf reached a final consensus in eitf no 0203 that gains and losses
realized or unrealized on all derivative instruments within the scope of sfas
no 133 should be shown net in the income statement whether or not settled
physically if the derivative instruments are held for trading purposes for
purposes of the consensus energy trading activities encompass contracts entered
into with the objective of generating profits on or exposure to shifts in
market prices this consensus was effective for financial statements issued for
periods beginning after december 15 2002 upon implementation of eitf no 0203
in 2003 nisource reevaluated its portfolio of contracts in order to determine
which contracts were required to be reported net in accordance with the
provisions of the consensus eitf no 0203 implementation resulted in equal and
offsetting reductions to revenues and cost of sales of 9454 million 29108
million and 22148 million for the years ended december 31 2002 2001 and
2000 respectively accordingly nisources operating income remained unchanged
for all periods presented

sfas no 143  accounting for asset retirement obligations nisource adopted the
provisions of sfas no 143 on january 1 2003 and as a result an asset
retirement obligations liability of 543 million was recognized of which 434
was related to assets sold in 2003 in addition nisource capitalized 413
million in additions to plant assets net of accumulated amortization of which
217 million was related to assets sold in 2003 and recognized regulatory
assets and liabilities of 12 million and 46 million respectively nisource
believes that the amounts recognized as regulatory assets will be recoverable in
future rates the cumulative aftertax effect of adopting sfas no 143 amounted
to 88 million certain costs of removal that have been and continue to be
included in depreciation rates and collected in the service rates of the
rateregulated subsidiaries did not meet the definition of an asset retirement
obligation pursuant to sfas no 143 the amount of the other costs of removal
was approximately 10 billion at december 31 2003 and december 31 2002 based
on rates for estimated removal costs embedded in composite depreciation rates
nisource reclassified its cost of removal as of december 31 2002 from
accumulated depreciation

to regulatory liabilities and other removal costs on the consolidated balance
sheet and upon adoption of sfas no 143 accounting for asset retirement
obligations recharacterized the liability as a regulatory liability as of
december 31 2003

for the twelve months ended december 31 2003 nisource recognized accretion
expense of 06 million the asset retirement obligations liability totaled
114 million at december 31 2003 had nisource adopted sfas no 143 at the
dates the actual liabilities were incurred the asset retirement obligations
liability would have been 494 million and 450 million at december 31 2001
and 2000 respectively of which 383 million and 346 million were related to
assets sold in 2003

additionally refer to recently issued accounting pronouncements in note 5 of
the notes of consolidated financial statements for information regarding
recently issued accounting standards

environmental matters

nisource affiliates have retained environmental liability including cleanup
liability associated with some of its former operations including those of
propane operations petroleum operations certain local gas distribution
companies and columbia energy resources most significant environmental
liability relates to former manufactured gas plant mgp sites whereas less
significant liability is associated with former petroleum operations and
metering stations using mercurycontaining measuring equipment

the ultimate liability in connection with the contamination sites will depend
upon many factors including the extent of environmental response actions
required other potentially responsible parties and their financial viability
and indemnification from previous facility owners only those corrective action
costs currently known and determinable can be considered probable and
reasonably estimable under sfas no 5 accounting for contingencies and
consistent with american institute of certified public accountants statement of
position 961 environmental remediation liabilities as costs become probable
and reasonably estimable reserves will be recorded and adjusted as appropriate
nisource believes that any environmental response actions required at former
operations for which it is ultimately liable will not have a material adverse
effect on nisources financial position

proposals for voluntary initiatives and mandatory controls are being discussed
both in the united states and worldwide to reduce socalled greenhouse gases
such as carbon dioxide a byproduct of burning fossil fuels and methane a
component of natural gas certain nisource affiliates engage in efforts to
voluntarily report and reduce their greenhouse gas emissions nisource will
monitor and participate in developments related to efforts to register and
potentially regulate greenhouse gas emissions

gas distribution operations

competition

gas distribution operations competes with investorowned municipal and
cooperative electric utilities throughout its service area and to a lesser
extent with other regulated natural gas utilities and propane and fuel oil
suppliers gas distribution operations continues to be a strong competitor in
the energy market as a result of strong customer preference for natural gas
competition with providers of electricity is generally strongest in the
residential and commercial markets of kentucky southern ohio central
pennsylvania and western virginia where electric rates are primarily driven by
lowcost coalfired generation in ohio and pennsylvania gas on gas
competition is also common gas competes with fuel oil and propane in the new
england markets mainly due to the installed base of fuel oil and propanebased
heating which over time has comprised a declining percentage of the overall
market

restructuring

during 2002 nisource carried out a new reorganization initiative which
resulted in the elimination of approximately 400 positions throughout all
nisource segments mainly affecting executive and other managementlevel
employees gas distribution operations accrued approximately 78 million of
salaries benefits and facilities costs associated with the reorganization
initiative the charge included 24 million related to the consolidation of
facilities affecting leased office space in richmond virginia and mount
lebanon pennsylvania payments made in 2003 in respect of the restructuring
items within gas distribution operations were 56 million additionally during
2003 the restructuring reserve was decreased by 31 million related to
previous reorganization initiatives due to adjustments in estimated costs the
restructuring liability at december 31 2003 and 2002 was 99 million and 187
million respectively

regulatory matters

changes in gas industry regulation which began in the mid1980s at the federal
level have broadened to retail customers at the state level for many years
large industrial and commercial customers have had the ability to purchase
natural gas directly from marketers and to use gas distribution operations
facilities for transportation services beginning in the mid1990s gas
distribution operations has provided these choicer programs for their retail
customers through december 2003 approximately 08 million of gas distribution
operations residential and small commercial customers have selected an
alternate supplier

gas distribution operations continues to offer customer choicesm opportunities
through regulatory initiatives in all of its jurisdictions while customer
choicesm programs are intended to provide all customer classes with the
opportunity to obtain gas supplies from alternative merchants gas distribution
operations expects to play a substantial role in supplying gas commodity
services to its customers in the foreseeable future as customers enroll in
these programs and purchase their gas from other suppliers the gas distribution
operations subsidiaries are sometimes left with pipeline capacity they have
contracted for but no longer need the state commissions in jurisdictions
served by gas distribution operations are at various stages in addressing these
issues and other transition considerations gas distribution operations is
currently recovering or has the opportunity to recover the costs resulting
from the unbundling of its services and believes that most of such future costs
will be mitigated or recovered methodologies for mitigating or recovering
transition costs include incentive sharing mechanisms reducing levels of
reserved pipeline capacity and mandatory assignment of pipeline capacity to
alternative suppliers

through october 2004 columbia of ohio is operating under a regulatory
stipulation approved by the public utilities commission of ohio puco on
october 9 2003 columbia of ohio and other parties filed with the puco an
amended stipulation that would govern columbia of ohios regulatory framework
from november 2004 through october 2010 the majority of columbia of ohios
contracts with interstate pipelines expire in october 2004 and the amended
stipulation would permit columbia to renew those contracts for firm capacity
sufficient to meet up to 100 of the design peak day requirements through
october 31 2005 and up to 95 of the design peak day requirements through
october 31 2010 among other things the amended stipulation would also 1
extend columbia of ohios choicer program through october 2010 2 provide
columbia of ohio with an opportunity to generate revenues sufficient to cover
the stranded costs associated with the choicer program and 3 allow
columbia of ohio to record postinservicecarrying charges on plant placed into
service after october 2004 and to defer the property taxes and depreciation
associated with such plant

on march 11 2004 the puco issued an order that adopted and modified the
stipulation from columbia gas of ohio and a collaborative of parties the order
extended columbia of ohios choice r program however the order limited the
time period of the stipulation through december 31 2007 and declined to
preapprove the amount of interstate pipeline firm capacity for which columbia
of ohio could contract in addition the puco made other modifications which
would limit columbia of ohios ability to generate additional revenues
sufficient to cover stranded costs including declining to mandate that natural
gas marketers participating in the choice r program obtain 75 of their
interstate capacity directly from columbia of ohio and changing the allocation
of revenues generated through offsystems sales the order allows columbia of
ohio to record postinservicecarrying charges on plant placed in service after
october 2004 and allows the deferral of property taxes and depreciation
associated with such plant although this order will have a minimal impact on
2004 nisources initial estimate is that this order if left unchanged could
potentially reduce operating income by approximately 20 million annually 2005
through 2007 columbia gas of ohio anticipates consistent with standard
regulatory process petitioning the commission for rehearing on the components
which have been modified

gas distribution operations

as part of the 2002 annual review of columbia of ohios gas cost recovery rates
the puco retained exeter associates inc exeter to conduct a
managementperformance review of columbia of ohios gas purchasing practices and
strategies on july 25 2003 exeter filed its final audit report in the audit
report exeter questioned columbia of ohios decision to recontract for all of
its pipeline capacity and recommended that columbia of ohio should contract for
only that postoctober 2004 capacity necessary to serve its bundled service
customers to meet the balancing requirements of choicer customers and to
accommodate the capacity assignment elections of choicer suppliers according
to exeter this approach would eliminate the need for columbia of ohio to engage
in offsystem sales activities to recover stranded costs exeter also criticized
columbia of ohios procedures for dealing with operational flow orders and
operational matching orders which procedures had been the subject of a
stipulation previously approved by the puco exeter therefore recommended that
columbia of ohios procedures for dealing with operational flow orders and
operational matching orders be revised exeter further criticized columbia of
ohios volume banking and balancing service because the service allegedly does
not reflect the costs of certain interstate pipeline charges and recommended
that columbia of ohio redesign its balancing rates the issues raised in the
exeter report will be resolved by the puco either in a rehearing on the
stipulation or in the 2002 gas cost recovery case

on december 17 2003 the puco approved an application by columbia of ohio and
other ohio ldcs to establish a tracking mechanism that will provide for recovery
of current bad debt expense and for the recovery over a fiveyear period of
previously deferred uncollected accounts receivable the approval of the tracker
will allow for the recovery of 252 million in previously uncollected accounts
receivable for columbia of ohio

on august 11 1999 the iurc approved a flexible gas cost adjustment mechanism
for northern indiana under the approved procedure the demand component of the
adjustment factor will be determined after hearings and iurc approval and made
effective on november 1 of each year the demand component will remain in effect
for one year until a new demand component is approved by the iurc the commodity
component of the adjustment factor will be determined by monthly filings which
will become effective on the first day of each calendar month subject to
refund the monthly filings do not require iurc approval but will be reviewed by
the iurc during the annual hearing that will take place regarding the demand
component filing northern indianas gas cost adjustment factor also includes a
gas cost incentive mechanism which allows the sharing of any cost savings or
cost increases with customers based on a comparison of actual gas supply
portfolio cost to a marketbased benchmark price northern indiana made its
annual filing for 2002 on august 29 2002 the iurc approved implementation of
interim rates subject to refund effective november 1 2002 testimony was
filed indicating that some gas costs should not be recovered on september 30
2003 the iurc issued an order adjusting the recovery of costs in march 2003 and
reducing recovery by 38 million on october 8 2003 the iurc approved the
demand component of the adjustment factor northern indiana made its annual
filing for 2003 on august 26 2003 the iurc approved implementation of interim
rates subject to refund effective november 1 2003 nisource expects the
proceeding with respect to the 2003 program to be concluded during the second
quarter of 2004 in addition the gas cost incentive mechanism program which
allows the sharing of any cost savings or cost increases with the customers
expires at the end of 2004 under the current settlement approved by the iurc
nisource expects the program to continue after 2004

effective november 2003 the pennsylvania public utility commission approved a
surcharge allowing cpa to recover certain expenses related to columbias
customer assistance program for lowincome customers the customer assistance
program is available to customers with incomes at or below 150 of the poverty
level the estimated increase in annual revenues as a result of the surcharge is
115 million annually however the surcharge will fluctuate based on the
number of customers and cost of gas approximately 18 million is reflected in
the year ended december 31 2003 the pennsylvania public utility commission
approved the customer assistance surcharge on october 30 2003 subject to
customer complaint cases filed in opposition to the surcharge

environmental matters

currently various environmental matters impact the gas distribution operations
segment as of december 31 2003 a reserve has been recorded to cover probable
environmental response actions refer to footnote 17g environmental matters in
the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information
regarding environmental matters for the gas distribution operations segment

gas distribution operations

market conditions

an economic slowdown during 2001 which has extended through 2003 contributed
to lower demand and the reduced industrial production and fuel switching to
coal heating oil and distillate resulted in industrial throughput falling 25
from its peak of over 400 billion cubic feet bcf the steel industry which
has historically represented over twothirds of the industrial throughput in
indiana and over onethird of the industrial throughput in the major markets of
ohio pennsylvania and kentucky was particularly hard hit with a number of
steelrelated companies filing for bankruptcy

spot prices for the winter of 20022003 were in the 400600 per dekatherm
dth range with a large spike toward 10 in february significantly higher than
the prices experienced during the 20012002 winter season entering the
20022003 winter season storage levels were near the top of the fiveyear
range however concerns over lower levels of natural gas production and
nearnormal temperatures sustained higher prices midway through the 20022003
winter season natural gas storage levels fell below the trailing fiveyear
average ending the winter season with the lowest level of gas in storage ever
recorded by the energy information administration eia since the eia began
recording such data in 1976

throughout the summer of 2003 prices stayed between 450 and 550dth thus
far during the winter of 20032004 price levels are between 500 and 700dth
though stocks of storage gas continue to be higher than the fiveyear average

all nisource gas distribution operations companies have stateapproved recovery
mechanisms that provide a means for full recovery of prudently incurred gas
costs gas costs are treated as passthrough costs and have no impact on the net
revenues recorded in the period the gas costs included in revenues are matched
with the gas cost expense recorded in the period and the difference is recorded
on the balance sheet to be included in future customer billings during times of
unusually high gas prices throughput and net revenue may be adversely affected
as customers may reduce their usage as a result of higher gas cost

the gas distribution operations companies have pursued nontraditional revenue
sources within the evolving natural gas marketplace these efforts include both
the sale of products and services upstream of their service territory the sale
of products and services in their service territories and gas supply cost
incentive mechanisms for service to their core markets the upstream products
are made up of transactions that occur between an individual gas distribution
company and a buyer for the sales of unbundled or rebundled gas supply and
capacity the onsystem services are offered by nisource to customers and
include products such as the transportation and balancing of gas on the gas
distribution operations company system the incentive mechanisms give the gas
distribution operations companies an opportunity to share in the savings created
from such things as gas purchase prices paid below an agreed upon benchmark and
its ability to reduce pipeline capacity charges the treatment of the revenues
generated from these types of transactions vary by operating company with some
sharing the benefits with customers and others using these revenues to mitigate
transition costs occurring as the result of customer choice programs described
above under regulatory matters

capital expenditures

the gas distribution operations segments net capital expenditure program was
1951 million in 2003 and is projected to be approximately 2102 million in
2004 new business initiatives totaled approximately 856 million in 2003 and
are expected to be 826 million in 2004 the remaining expenditures are
primarily for modernizing and upgrading facilities

weather

in general nisource calculates the weather related revenue variance based on
changing customer demand driven by weather variance from normal heating
degreedays normal is evaluated using heating degree days across the nisource
distribution region while the temperature base for measuring heating
degreedays ie the estimated average daily temperature at which heating load
begins varies slightly across the region the nisource composite measurement is
based on 62 degrees in 2003 nisource changed its definition of normal heating
degreedays using weather information from the average of 30 years ended 2001
this resulted in a decrease in normal heating degreedays of about 35

gas distribution operations

weather in the gas distribution operations service territories for 2003 was
approximately 4 colder than normal and 8 colder than 2002 increasing net
revenues by approximately 601 million over the year ended december 31 2002

in 2002 weather in the gas distribution operations service territories was 7
warmer than normal however weather conditions were 6 colder than for the year
ended december 31 2001 which resulted in increased net revenue of
approximately 218 million over 2001

throughput

total volumes sold and transported for the year ended december 31 2003 were
8789 million dekatherms mdth compared to 9242 mdth for 2002 this reduction
was primarily due to a decrease in offsystem sales as a result of fewer market
opportunities

total volumes sold and transported of 9242 mdth for 2002 decreased 826 mdth
from 2001 this decrease was primarily due to the decline in offsystem sales

net revenues

net revenues for 2003 were 14766 million up 878 million from 2002 mainly
as a result of increased deliveries of natural gas to residential commercial
and industrial customers of 601 million due to colder weather during the first
quarter of 2003 increased nontraditional revenues of 86 million and higher
cost trackers and gross receipts taxes generally offset in operating expenses

net revenues for 2002 were 13888 million down 36 million from 2001 mainly
as a result of a decrease in offsystem sales and incentive programs amounting
to 243 million mostly offset by a 218 million increase in gas distribution
revenue as a result of colder weather as compared to 2001

operating income

for the twelve months ended december 31 2003 operating income for the gas
distribution operations segment was 5064 million an increase of 473 million
over the same period in 2002 the increase was the result of higher net revenue
mentioned above the approval of a bad debt tracker for columbia of ohio for the
recovery 252 million of previously uncollected accounts receivable and reduced
administrative and employee related expenses of 145 million these benefits to
operating income were offset in part by increased bad debt expense of 259
million higher pension and postretirement expenses of 98 million and 224
million of insurance recoveries for environmental expenses recognized in the
2002 period

for the twelve months ended december 31 2002 operating income for the gas
distribution operations segment was 4591 million an increase of 783 million
over the same period in 2001 the increase consisted of 218 million from
increased deliveries as a result of favorable weather and 819 million from
lower operating expenses these lower operating expenses consisted mainly of the
discontinuation of the amortization of goodwill of 428 million 224 million
of insurance recoveries for environmental expenses decreased employeerelated
and support services expenses resulting from reorganization initiatives of 193
million and reductions of 92 million in reduced uncollectible customer
accounts and other customer related expenses the favorable variances were
partially offset by a decrease of 243 million in offsystem sales and
incentive programs

pipeline firm service contracts

since implementation of order no 636 in the early 1990s the services of
columbia transmission and columbia gulf have consisted of open access
transportation services and open access storage services in the case of
columbia transmission these services are provided primarily to local
distribution companies ldc and compete to some degree with comparable
services provided by other interstate pipelines the majority of the firm
contracts that were restructured in order no 636 expire in late 2004 customer
decisions on capacity resubscription are affected by many factors including
decisions by state regulators on the treatment of pipeline capacity agreements
in the context of ldc unbundling proceedings several ldcs have effectively
extended their longterm capacity commitments and the companies are in the
process of negotiating with other firm capacity holders

transportation for new electric generation projects

columbia transmission received approval from the ferc to construct facilities to
provide service at levels up to 560000 dth per day to three electric generating
facilities originally planned to be in service in 2003 due to market
conditions customers at two of the proposed electric generation facilities
elected to cancel the underlying contracts for service and plans for these
facilities have been terminated initial service to a 1020megawatt generating
facility in maryland began in november 2003 under contracts providing up to
270000 dth per day of transportation capacity

proposed millennium pipeline project

the proposed millennium pipeline project millennium in which columbia
transmission is participating and will serve as developer and operator will
provide access to a number of supply and storage basins and the dawn ontario
trading hub the millennium partnership recently announced its intention to
develop the project in two phases phase 1 of the project subject to demand is
expected to be in service by november 2006 and will include the 186mile section
from corning ny to ramapo ny transporting 500000 dth per day
millenniums upstream link will be via the empire state pipeline an existing
pipeline that originates at the canadian border and extends easterly to near
syracuse empire will construct a lateral pipeline southward to connect with
millennium near corning ny this will provide a continuous link between
canadian gas supplies and the millennium pipeline with a capacity of at least
250000 dth per day assuming the resolution of certain permitting issues
discussed below plans call for the 46mile millennium phase 2 to cross the
hudson river linking to the new york city metropolitan market via the
consolidated edison distribution system

on september 19 2002 the ferc issued its order granting final certificate
authority for the original millennium project and specified that millennium may
not begin construction until certain environmental and other conditions are met
one such condition impacting phase 2 of the project is compliance with the
coastal zone management act which is administered by the state of new yorks
department of state nydos nydos has determined that the hudson river crossing
plan is not consistent with the act millenniums appeal of that decision to the
united states department of commerce was denied millennium filed an appeal of
the us department of commerce ruling relating to the projects hudson river
crossing plan in the us district court for the district of columbia on
february 13 2004 millennium is in ongoing discussions with potential shippers
regarding the extent location and timing of their needs and anticipates
filing later in 2004 to amend its ferc certificate to accommodate the
abovedescribed phasing of the project

the sponsors of the proposed millennium project are columbia transmission
westcoast energy inc subsidiary of duke energy corp transcanada pipe lines
ltd and mcn energy group inc subsidiary of dte energy co

regulatory matters

on february 28 2003 columbia transmission filed with the federal energy
regulatory commission ferc certain scheduled annual rate adjustments
designated as the transportation costs rate adjustment tcra retainage
adjustment mechanism ram and electric power cost adjustment epca these
filings seek to recover certain expenses relating to transportation costs
incurred by columbia transmission on interconnecting pipelines and electric
costs incurred in the operation of certain compressors tcra and epca
respectively as well as quantities of gas required by columbia transmission to
operate its pipeline system ram the recovery of each of these costs is done
through a tracker which ensures recovery of only actual expenses on october
1 2003 ferc issued an order accepting columbia transmissions compliance
filing supporting its tcra filing and accepting the full recovery of upstream
transportation costs as proposed in the filing on february 11 2004 ferc
approved an order regarding the annual epca filing which upheld columbia
transmissions ability to fully recover its electric costs but required
columbia transmission to implement a separate epca rate to recover electric
power costs incurred by a newly expanded electricpowered compressor station
from specific customers the order also limits columbia transmissions ability
to prospectively discount its epca rates management does not believe this order
will have a material financial impact the ferc has not yet issued a final order
in columbia transmissions 2003 ram proceeding

restructuring

during 2002 nisource carried out a new reorganization initiative which
resulted in the elimination of approximately 400 positions throughout all
nisource segments mainly affecting executive and other managementlevel
employees during 2002 gas transmission and storage operations accrued
approximately 148 million of salaries benefits and facilities costs
associated with the reorganization initiative payments made in 2003 in respect
of restructured items within gas transmission and storage operations was 83
million additionally during 2003 the restructuring reserve was decreased by
15 million related to previous reorganization initiatives due to adjustments
in estimated costs the restructuring liability at december 31 2003 and 2002
was 71 million and 169 million respectively

environmental matters

currently various environmental matters impact the gas transmission and storage
operations segment as of december 31 2003 a reserve has been recorded to
cover probable environmental response actions refer to footnote 17g
environmental matters in the notes to the consolidated financial statements
for additional information regarding environmental matters for the gas
transmission and storage operations

storage base gas sales

base gas represents storage volumes that are maintained to ensure that adequate
pressure exists to deliver current gas inventory as a result of ongoing
improvements made in its storage operations columbia transmission determined
that a portion of these storage volumes were no longer necessary to maintain
deliverability columbia transmission sold 08 mdth 20 mdth and 54 mdth of
storage base gas volumes during 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively these sales
resulted in pretax gains of 16 million 29 million and 114 million in
2003 2002 and 2001 respectively

longterm notes receivable

in 1999 columbia transmission sold certain gathering facilities to a third
party for approximately 22 million the buyer executed a promissory note which
provides for payment of the purchase price to columbia transmission over a
fiveyear period in the second quarter of 2002 an appropriate reserve was
recorded against the receivable in light of the failure to receive timely
payments from the counterparty during the third quarter of 2002 management
negotiated a new payment schedule and secured a guarantee from the third partys
parent company as security for the note columbia transmission is in discussions
with the counterparty about its failure to make a 500000 payment that was due
on january 1 2004 a notice of default was sent on february 10 2004 the
counterparty has until march 11 2004 to make this payment or columbia
transmission will proceed to execute the default remedies outlined in the
agreement at december 31 2003 the balance of the note was 92 million

capital expenditure program

the gas transmission and storage operations segments capital expenditure
program was 1205 million in 2003 and is projected to be approximately 1385
million in 2004 new business initiatives totaled approximately 162 million in
2003 only 31 million of new business expenditures in 2004 are currently
budgeted excluding any capital requirements for the proposed millennium project
the remaining expenditures are primarily for modernizing and upgrading
facilities and complying with the requirements of the us department of
transportations dot recently issued integrity management rule the dot
integrity management rule requires that high consequence areas on transmission
lines be assessed and remediated if required within a 10year period beginning
december 2002 compliance will entail extensive assessment including pipeline
modifications to allow for testing devices and facility replacement depending
on test results

throughput

columbia transmissions throughput consists of transportation and storage
services for ldcs and other customers within its market area which covers
portions of northeastern midatlantic midwestern and southern states and the
district of columbia throughput for columbia gulf reflects mainline
transportation services from rayne louisiana to leach kentucky and shorthaul
transportation services from the gulf of mexico to rayne louisiana crossroads
serves customers in northern indiana and ohio and granite state provides service
in new hampshire maine and massachusetts

throughput for the gas transmission and storage operations segment totaled
12389 mdth for 2003 compared to 13143 mdth in 2002 the decrease of 754
mdth was primarily due to lower deliveries to dual fueled electric power
generators which chose not to run on the high priced gas experienced throughout
2003 also contributing to the decrease was the continued decline of offshore
natural gas production

throughput for the gas transmission and storage operations segment totaled
13143 mdth for 2002 compared to 12413 mdth in 2001 the increase of 730
mdth reflected slightly colder weather in 2002 and an increase in market demand

net revenues

net revenues were 8373 million for 2003 a decrease of 371 million from
2002 the decrease was primarily due to 93 million of lower interruptible
service revenues and 104 million of lower firm service revenues the decline
in interruptible revenues was due to higher use of capacity by firm customers
resulting in less capacity available for interruptible services firm service
revenues were reduced due to actions taken to alleviate late season
deliverability limitations in the pipelines eastern storage fields the
limitations resulted from the cumulative effect of facility outages that
restricted eastern storage field inventory a work stoppage that extended the
outages and abovenormal demand on storage withdrawals due to sustained cold
weather in addition storage and transportation revenues decreased 135
million primarily due to reduced deliveries to power generating facilities

net revenues were 8744 million for 2002 a decrease of 92 million from 2001
the decrease was primarily due to an 85 million reduction in gains on the
sales of storage base gas that occurred in the 2002 period compared to the 2001
period

operating income

operating income of 3988 million in 2003 increased 05 million from 2002 the
371 million decline in revenues discussed above was offset by a 125 million
reduction in employeerelated and administrative expense an improvement to
income of 110 million based on a decrease in estimated environmental
expenditures and a 66 million reversal of a litigation reserve relating to a
lawsuit that was settled in the second quarter of 2003 the 2002 period was also
favorably impacted a reduction in a reserve for environmental expenditures of
100 million a 100 million reduction in reserves related to unaccountedfor
gas offset by 148 million of increased expenses related to nisources
reorganization initiatives and other employeerelated costs and 87 million
related to the recognition of a reserve related to a longterm note receivable

operating income of 3983 million in 2002 increased 493 million from 2001
the increase was due primarily to the effects of discontinuing the amortization
of 503 million of goodwill a reduction in a reserve for environmental
expenditures of 100 million a 100 million reduction in reserves related to
unaccountedfor gas and lower employeerelated and support services expenses
approximating 136 million the favorable impacts were partly offset by 85
million from lower gains on the sales of storage base gas that occurred in the
2002 period compared with the 2001 period expenses related to nisources
reorganization initiatives totaling 148 million and 87 million related to
the recognition of a reserve related to a longterm note receivable

nisource has accounted for the assets sold as discontinued operations and has
adjusted periods after 1999 accordingly

whiting clean energy peis whiting clean energy project at bps whiting
indiana refinery was placed in service in 2002 initially the facility was not
able to deliver steam to bp to the extent originally contemplated without plant
modifications whiting clean energy has commenced an arbitration proceeding to
seek recovery of damages from the engineering procurement and construction
contractor whiting clean energy is also pursuing recovery from the insurance
provider for construction delays and necessary plant modifications the
contractor has asserted that it fully performed under its contract and is
demanding payment of the full contract price plus additional amounts for
remediation

pei estimates that the facility will operate at a loss in the near term based on
the current market view of forward pricing for gas and electricity for 2003
the aftertax loss was approximately 300 million and the expected 2004
aftertax loss is expected to be similar to 2003 based on a similar market for
gas and electricity the profitability of the project in future periods will be
dependent on among other things prevailing prices in the energy markets and
regional load dispatch patterns because of the expected losses from this
facility and decreases in estimated forward pricing for electricity versus
changes in gas prices an impairment study was performed in the first quarter of
2003 on this facility in accordance with sfas no 144 accounting for the
impairment or disposal of longlived assets the study indicated that at that
time no impairment was necessary

however the study includes many estimates and assumptions for the 40year
estimated useful life of the facility changes in these estimates and
assumptions such as forward prices for electricity and gas volatility in the
market etc could result in a situation where total undiscounted net revenues
are less than the carrying value of the facility which would result in a
writedown that could be significant

during the second quarter of 2003 peis wholly owned subsidiary whiting energy

december 31 2003 a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental

the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding
environmental matters for the other operations segment

net revenues

for the year ended 2003 net operating revenues were 160 million an increase
of 22 million from 2002 the increase in net revenues was primarily due to
losses of 117 million recorded in 2002 associated with nisources decision to
scale back its gas trading business slightly offset by losses of 16 million
recorded in 2003 associated with the power trading business as a result of lower
volatility in the market and decreased volumes sold and a decrease in whiting
clean energy net revenues of 70

for the year ended 2002 net operating revenues were 138 million a decrease
of 484 million from 2001 the decrease in net revenues primarily resulted from
nisources decision to scale back its gas trading business the change in value
of nisources gas and power marketing portfolios and the sale of smp

all results reflect power trading activities on a net revenue basis the 2001
and half of the 2002 results related to gas trading activities are reflected on
a net basis beginning july 1 2002 nisource exited the gas trading business
all gas marketing sales at nisource after june 30 2003 were reported on a gross
basis pursuant to eitf 0203  refer to footnote 5 for further information on

operating income loss

the other operations segment reported an operating loss of 438 million in 2003
compared to an operating loss of 431 million in the 2002 period the 2003
period included a gain on the sale of nisources interest in midtex gas
storage llp of 75 million a reversal of a litigation reserve of 70
relating to a lawsuit that was settled in the fourth quarter of 2003 and an
increase in operating losses at whiting clean energy 2002 operating expenses
were lower as a result of a reduction in estimated sales taxes of 114 million
that occurred in 2002 related to sales of natural gas to customers of a
subsidiary previously engaged in the retail and wholesale gas marketing
business mostly offset by expenses of 98 million associated with the july 1
2002 sale of a portfolio of tpc gas marketing contracts

the other operations segment reported an operating loss of 431 million for
2002 an improvement of 265 million compared to the 2001 period the
improvement was primarily attributable to reduced losses related to nisources
other noncore subsidiaries a 155 million litigation settlement related to
mhp affecting the 2001 period a 114 million reduction in reserves for
estimated sales taxes of a subsidiary previously engaged in the gas marketing
business consolidation of facilities of 113 million resulting from
reorganization initiatives and a 31 million gain on the sale of contracts
associated with scaling back the energy trading operations the improvements
were partly offset by an increase of 139 million in depreciation and operating
expenses associated with whiting clean energy and a decrease of 129 million in
the value of the power trading portfolio

competition and changes in the regulatory environment

the regulatory frameworks applicable to nisources operations at both the state
and federal levels are undergoing fundamental changes these changes have had
and will continue to have an impact on nisources operations structure and
profitability at the same time competition within the gas and electric
industries will create opportunities to compete for new customers and revenues
management continually seeks new ways to be more competitive and profitable in
this changing environment including providing gas customers with increased
choice for products and services disposing of noncore assets and operations
and developing new energyrelated products and services for residential
commercial and industrial customers

natural gas competition open access to natural gas supplies over interstate
pipelines and the deregulation of the commodity price of gas has led to
tremendous change in the energy markets which continue to evolve during the
past few years local distribution company ldc customers and marketers began
to purchase gas directly from producers and marketers and an open competitive
market for gas supplies emerged this separation or unbundling of the
transportation and other services offered by pipelines and ldcs allows customers
to select services independent from the purchase of the commodity nisources
gas distribution subsidiaries are involved in programs that provide residential
customers the opportunity to purchase their natural gas requirements from third
parties and use the nisource gas distribution subsidiaries for transportation
services

electric competition in 1996 the federal energy regulatory commission ferc
ordered that all public utilities owning controlling or operating electric
transmission lines file nondiscriminatory openaccess tariffs and offer
wholesale electricity suppliers and marketers the same transmission service they
provide to themselves in 1997 ferc accepted for filing northern indianas
openaccess transmission tariff and issued an opinion on december 31 2002 in
december 1999 ferc issued order 2000 a final rule addressing the formation and
operation of regional transmission organizations rtos see item 7 electric
operations  regulatory matters the rule was intended to eliminate pricing
inequities in the provisioning of wholesale transmission service nisource does
not believe that compliance with the new rules will be material to its future
earnings although wholesale customers currently represent a small portion of
northern indianas electricity sales northern indiana intends to continue its
efforts to retain and add wholesale customers by offering competitive rates and
also intends to expand the customer base for which it provides transmission
services

nisources other operations also experience competition for energy sales and
related services from third party providers nisource meets these challenges
through innovative programs aimed at providing energy products and services at
competitive prices while also providing new services that are responsive to the
evolving energy market and customer requirements

                               consolidated review

the consolidated review information should be read taking into account the
critical accounting policies applied by nisource and discussed in other
information of this item 7

net income
for the twelve months ended december 31 2002 nisource reported income from
continuing operations of 4257 million or 202 per share compared to 2264
million or 110 per share in 2001 and 1419 million or 105 per share in
2000 all per share amounts are based on basic common shares

including results from discontinued operations and a change in accounting
affecting the 2001 period nisource reported 2002 net income of 3725 million
or 177 per share 2001 net income of 2162 million or 105 per share and
1509 million or 112 per share for 2000

the results for 2002 and 2001 as compared with 2000 are not comparable due to
the acquisition of columbia that was completed on november 1 2000 the results
for 2002 and 2001 included twelve months of columbia operations while 2000
included november and december only in addition earnings per share are not
comparable because of an equity offering of 414 million shares that was
completed in november 2002 an equity offering of approximately 115 million
shares that was completed in november 2000 and the issuance of 725 million
shares of additional nisource shares in connection with the columbia
acquisition

net revenues

total consolidated net revenues gross revenues less cost of sales for the
twelve months ended december 31 2002 were 33290 million a 779 million
decrease compared with 2001 the decrease in revenues was primarily attributable
to reduced offsystem sales incentive programs and nonweatherrelated gas
sales totaling 415 million lower prices related to increased sales of natural
gas production to satisfy requirements under forward sales agreements amounting
to 327 million issued credits totaling 281 million pertaining to the
indiana utility regulatory commission iurc electric rate review settlement
129 million from scaling back the energy trading operations and an 85
million reduction in gains on the sales of storage base gas slightly offsetting
the decrease was a 366 million impact of favorable weather due to a much
colder fall heating season which increased natural gas sales and deliveries
and a warmer summer cooling season that positively impacted electric sales

net revenues for 2001 of 34069 million increased 14592 million over 2000
the increase primarily attributable to the inclusion of twelve months of
columbia operations in 2001 compared to two months in 2000 was reduced by
approximately 630 million from record setting warmerthannormal weather
during the heating season

expenses

operating expenses were 21263 million in 2002 a 2477 million decrease from
2001 a portion of the decrease was attributable to a 1500 million reduction
in operation and maintenance expenses primarily due to lower employeerelated
support services and facilities expenses of 354 million resulting from
reorganization initiatives insurance recoveries of environmental expenses
totaling 245 million a reversal of 303 million in reserves for estimated
taxes and environmental expenditures reduced dry well and geological expenses
of 178 million and a reduction of 168 million from reduced uncollectible
customer accounts and other customerrelated expenses the 2001 period was
unfavorably impacted by the 155 million litigation settlement related to
market hub partners lp mhp also contributing to the decrease was the
elimination of 931 million of goodwill amortization as a result of a financial
accounting standards board fasb accounting standard that affected goodwill
amortization beginning january 1 2002 and 271 million primarily from gains on
the sales of nisources utility linelocating and marking business and a
significant portion of tpcs gas trading contracts

for 2002 employeerelated expenses were increased by higher pension and post
retirement benefits expense resulting from a decrease of 50 basis points in the
discount rate used to value the liabilities 2001 pension expense was further
impacted by a flat return on plan assets in 2001 versus the expected 9 return
due to poor performance in world equity markets during 2002 and resulting
negative returns on plan assets 2003 pension expense is expected to increase
428 million over the 2002 level

operating expenses of 23740 million for 2001 increased 10386 million over
2000 the increase was primarily attributable to including twelve months of
columbia operations in 2001 compared to two months in 2000 in addition 2001
was negatively impacted by restructuring costs of 287 million uncollectibles
of 178 million related to the enron bankruptcy an increase in other
uncollectible customer accounts of 131 million and a one time charge of 155
million related to the settlement of the mhp litigation other transition and
onetime events increased operating expenses 217 million depreciation
depletion and amortization expense in 2001 included goodwill amortization of
931 million for twelve months attributable to the columbia acquisition
compared to 150 million for two months in 2000

other income deductions

other income deductions in 2002 reduced income 5431 million compared to a
reduction of 6157 million in 2001 interest expense net decreased 719
million from 2001 primarily due to debt reduction during 2002 of 14 billion
resulting from proceeds from the sale of 414 million shares of common stock
approximating 7349 million the sales of iwcr and smp and positive operating
cash flows lower shortterm interest rates also contributed to the decrease
see notes 15 and 16 of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional
information minority interest consisting of dividends paid on
companyobligated mandatorily redeemable preferred securities was 204 million
in both 2002 and 2001

nisource inc

other income deductions in 2001 reduced income 6157 million compared to a
reduction in 2000 of 3441 million interest expense net increased 2935
million over 2000 primarily due to the full year effect of interest on
outstanding columbia debt and the debt incurred for the acquisition partly
offset by a decrease in interest rates on shortterm borrowings minority
interest consisting of dividends paid on companyobligated mandatorily
redeemable preferred securities was 204 million in both 2001 and 2000 other
net increased income 102 million in 2001 and decreased income 114 million in
2000 the 2000 period included a charitable donation of facilities

income taxes

income taxes increased 431 million in 2002 as compared with 2001 and increased
645 million in 2001 over 2000 primarily as a result of higher pretax income
in each succeeding period the effective income tax rates were 355  457 and
471 in 2002 2001 and 2000 respectively the change in the effective tax rate
in 2002 versus the previous year was due to discontinuing the amortization of
goodwill in 2002 see note 10 of the notes to consolidated financial statements
for additional information

discontinued operations

discontinued operations reflected an aftertax loss of 532 million or a loss
of 25 cents per share in 2002 compared to an aftertax loss of 142 million
or loss of 7 cents per share in 2001 and income of 90 million or 7 cents per
share in 2000 the 2002 results were unfavorably impacted by a noncash charge
of 513 million after tax that was recognized as a result of the continuing
depressed market for dark fiber and nisources decision to exit the
telecommunications business the loss in the 2001 period was primarily related
to the results of transcoms operations including an impairment charge of 57
million after tax the 2000 period primarily reflects the operations of the
water utilities

                         liquidity and capital resources

generally cash flow from operations has provided sufficient liquidity to meet
operating requirements a significant portion of nisources operations most
notably in the gas distribution gas transportation and electric businesses are
subject to seasonal fluctuations in cash flow during the heating season which
is primarily from november through march cash receipts from gas sales and
transportation services typically exceed cash requirements in the summer
months cash receipts from electric sales normally exceed cash requirements
also during the summer months cash on hand together with external shortterm
and longterm financing is used in operations to purchase gas to place in
storage for heating season deliveries perform necessary maintenance of
facilities make capital improvements in plant and expand service into new
areas

net cash from operations for the twelve months ended december 31 2002 was
11724 million cash generated from working capital was 1656 million
principally driven by reductions in inventories and gas receivables partly
offset by payments for current liabilities and the timing of the recovery of gas
and fuel costs

in february 2003 nisource issued approximately 131 million shares of common
stock associated with the settlement of forward equity agreements comprising a
component of the corporate pies concurrently with the settlement of the forward
agreements nisource remarketed the underlying securities nisource received the
net proceeds of the remarketing in satisfaction of the corporate pies holders
obligation under the forward equity agreements the purchaser of the remarketed
securities purchased 615 notes due in 2013 using the debentures for
consideration

on january 28 2003 nisource announced that its subsidiary cnr had sold its
interest in a natural gas exploration and production joint venture in new york
state for 95 million to an undisclosed buyer the proceeds were used to reduce
shortterm debt

in november 2002 nisource issued 414 million shares of common stock at a
pershare price of 1830 1775 on a net basis the net proceeds of
approximately 7349 million were used to reduce debt

threeyear facility that expires on march 23 2004 is being amended to allow for
the aggregate letters of credit outstanding under this agreement to be increased

borrowing needs is attributable to the sales iwcr smp and the exploration and
production joint venture the proceeds from the november 2002 equity offering
and positive operating cash flows

subsidiaries and bring them closer to nisources ratings going forward on
february 5 2002 fitch ratings reaffirmed nisources bbb senior unsecured
longterm credit rating and its f2 commercial paper rating but revised
nisources ratings outlook from stable to negative

on november 27 2002 nisource completed an equity offering realizing 7349
million in net proceeds which were used for the repayment of debt the equity
offering significantly improved nisources financial position by reducing its
debt leverage ratios in addition nisource expects to further reduce leverage
by using the proceeds from the recent sale of its natural gas exploration and
production joint venture in new york to reduce outstanding debt while the
rating agencies stated that they have welcomed nisources recent actions to
reduce financial leverage additional balance sheet improvement measures may be
necessary to either secure a ratings upgrade or to improve the current ratings
outlook


tpc has entered into electric trading agreements that contain ratings triggers
that require increased collateral if the credit ratings of nisource or certain
of its subsidiaries fall below bbb at standard and poors or baa3 at moodys
the collateral requirement from a downgrade below the ratings trigger levels
would amount to approximately 150 million to 200 million in addition to
agreements with ratings triggers there are other agreements that contain
adequate assurance or material adverse change provisions the collateral
requirement for those agreements would amount to approximately 500 million to
550 million

in the case of nisources primary energy subsidiaries ratings triggers would
result in increases in the financing rates used to calculate operating lease
payments for four of the projects one other primary energy project would
require the issuance of a letter of credit in the event of a ratings downgrade
to ba1 by moodys or bb by standard and poors the letter of credit required
in the event of a downgrade would have a face amount of 170 million to 340
million depending on the extent of the downgrade

for 2002 capital expenditures were 6189 million a decrease of 603 million
over 2001 the gas distribution segments capital program in 2002 included new
business initiatives to extend service to new areas and develop future markets
through new services that may be added to the existing business and to create a
potential new pool of customers as well as expenditures to ensure safe
reliable and improved service to customers and modernize and upgrade facilities
the transmission and storage segment invested 1280 million in 2002 primarily
on modernizing and upgrading facilities and new business initiatives to maintain
and expand market share in storage and transportation interstate commerce by
meeting the demands of consumers who will use gas for electric power generation
and meeting the needs of existing new or growing customers through the
construction of significant new facilities either whollyowned by nisource or
in partnership with other qualified project participants the electric capital
program included improvements related to the operational integrity of
generation transmission and distribution assets expenditures related to
environmental compliance regarding nitrogen oxide nox reduction and additions
to electric distribution systems related to new business companies within the
other segment invested 59 million in energy technologies

for 2003 the projected capital program is expected to be 6478 million which
is 289 million higher than the 2002 level this higher spending is mainly due
to increased expenditures for nox compliance a portion of which will be
recovered through the northern indiana environmental tracker the program is
expected to be funded primarily via cash from operations

pension funding

due to lower than expected returns on plan assets over the past three years and
a lower assumed discount rate nisources pension plans are currently in an
underfunded position although nisource expects market returns to revert to
normal levels as demonstrated in historical periods nisource may be required to
provide additional funding for the obligations if returns on plan assets fall
short of the assumed 90 longterm rate also nisource expects pension expense
for 2003 to increase 428 million over the amount recognized in 2002 see note

                 market risk sensitive instruments and positions

risk is an inherent part of nisources energy businesses and activities the
extent to which nisource properly and effectively identifies assesses monitors
and manages each of the various types of risk involved in its businesses is
critical to its profitability nisource seeks to identify assess monitor and
manage in accordance with defined policies and procedures the following
principal risks involved in nisources energy businesses commodity market risk
interest rate risk and credit risk risk management at nisource is a
multifaceted process with independent oversight that requires constant
communication judgment and knowledge of specialized products and markets
nisources senior management takes an active role in the risk management process
and has developed policies and procedures that require specific administrative
and business functions to assist in the identification assessment and control
of various risks in recognition of the increasingly varied and complex nature
of the energy business nisources risk management policies and procedures
continue to evolve and are subject to ongoing review and modification

nisource inc

through its various business activities nisource is exposed to both nontrading
business and trading risks the nontrading risks to which nisource is exposed
include interest rate risk commodity market risk and credit risk of its
subsidiaries the risk resulting from trading activities consists primarily of
commodity market and credit risks nisources risk management policy permits the
use of certain financial instruments to manage its market risk including
futures forwards options and swaps

risk management at nisource is defined as the process by which the organization
ensures that the risks to which it is exposed are the risks to which it desires
to be exposed to achieve its primary business objectives nisource employs
various analytic techniques to measure and monitor its market and credit risks
including valueatrisk var and instrument sensitivity to market factors var
represents the potential loss or gain for an instrument or portfolio from
changes in market factors for a specified time period and at a specified
confidence level

nontrading risks

commodity price risk resulting from nontrading activities at nisources
rateregulated subsidiaries is limited since current regulations allow recovery
of prudently incurred purchased power fuel and gas costs through the
ratemaking process as the utility industry undergoes deregulation these
operations may be providing services without the benefit of the traditional
ratemaking process and will be more exposed to commodity price risk

effective july 1 2002 tpc sold a significant portion of its net obligations
under its gas forward transaction portfolio physical storage inventory and
associated agreements to a third party prior to the sale tpcs operations
included the activities of its gas and power trading businesses beginning with
the effective date of the sale the primary remaining operations associated with
tpc include commercial and industrial gas sales including arranging supply
power marketing and gas supply associated with nisources single merchant
cogeneration facility marketing a portion of the gas produced from nisources
exploration and production operations and power trading with the exception of
power trading and one remaining gas trading deal which expired in october 2002
since july 1 2002 the gasrelated activities at tpc are no longer considered
trading activities for accounting purposes

nisource is exposed to interest rate risk as a result of changes in interest
rates on borrowings under revolving credit agreements and lines of credit which
have interest rates that are indexed to shortterm market interest rates and
refinancing risk in the commercial paper markets at december 31 2002 the
combined borrowings outstanding under these facilities totaled 9131 million
nisource is also exposed to interest rate risk due to changes in interest rates
on fixedtovariable interest rate swaps that hedge the fair value of a portion
of columbias longterm debt on september 3 2002 columbia entered into new
receive fixed and pay floating interest rate swap agreements totaling 2815
million with three counterparties effective as of september 5 2002 according
to the agreements nisource will receive payments based upon a fixed 732
interest rate and will pay a floating interest amount based on us 6month
liborbba plus 266 per annum in total columbia has entered into
fixedtovariable interest rate swaps on 6630 million of its longterm debt
based upon average borrowings under agreements subject to fluctuations in
shortterm market interest rates during 2002 and 2001 an increase in shortterm
interest rates of 100 basis points 1 would have increased interest expense by
175 million and 232 million for the years 2002 and 2001 respectively

nisources primary energy subsidiary had engaged in interest rate swaps to fix
the floating payment related to a portion of a lease payment that floated with a
referenced interest rate and designated these instruments as cash flow hedges
the swaps expired june 30 2002 and subsequently upon lease termination at
december 31 2002 primary energy purchased the previously leased facilities

due to the nature of the industry credit risk is a factor in many of nisources
business activities credit risk arises because of the possibility that a
customer supplier or counterparty will not be able or willing to fulfill its
obligations on a transaction on or before the settlement date for derivative
contracts such as interest rate swaps credit risk arises when counterparties
are obligated to pay nisource the positive fair value or receivable resulting
from the execution of contract terms exposure to credit risk is measured in
terms of both current and potential exposure current credit exposure is
generally measured by the notional or principal value of financial instruments
and direct credit substitutes such as commitments standby letters of credit
and guarantees because many of nisources exposures vary with changes in market
prices nisource also estimates the potential credit exposure over the remaining
term of transactions through statistical analyses of market prices in
determining exposure nisource considers collateral and master netting
agreements which are used to reduce individual counterparty credit risk

prior to the july 1 2002 sale of the tpc gas marketing and trading contracts
nisources trading operations consisted of gas and powerrelated activities
beginning july 1 with the exception of one remaining gas trading deal which
expired in october 2002 the trading activities of tpc have involved power only

the transactions associated with nisources power trading operations give rise
to various risks including market risks resulting from the potential loss from
adverse changes in the market prices of electricity the power trading
operations market and trade overthecounter contracts for the purchase and sale
of electricity those contracts within the power trading portfolio that require
settlement by physical delivery are often net settled in accordance with
industry standards

market risk measurement

market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market
prices rates indices volatilities correlations or other market factors such
as liquidity will result in losses for a specified position or portfolio
nisource estimates the oneday var across the marketing and trading groups that
utilize derivatives using variancecovariance at a 95 confidence level based
on the results of the var analysis the daily market exposure for power trading
on an average high and low basis was 04 million 08 million and effectively
zero during 2002 respectively the daily var for the gas marketing and trading
portfolios on an average high and low basis was 02 million 06 million and
01 million during 2002 respectively prospectively management has set the
var limits at 05 million for gasrelated activities and 25 million for power
trading exceeding the var limits would result in management actions to reduce
portfolio risk

accounting change

effective january 1 2001 nisource adopted the fasbs statement of financial
accounting standards sfas no 133 accounting for derivative instruments and
hedging activities as subsequently amended by sfas no 137 and sfas no 138
collectively referred to as sfas no 133 these statements establish
accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments including certain
derivative instruments embedded in other contracts collectively referred to as
derivatives and for hedging activities sfas no 133 requires an entity to
recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet
and measure those instruments at fair value if certain conditions are met a
derivative may be specifically designated as a a hedge of the exposure to
changes in the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or an unrecognized
firm commitment or b a hedge of the exposure to variable cash flows of a
forecasted transaction the accounting for changes in the fair value of a
derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and resulting
designation

the adoption of sfas no 133 on january 1 2001 resulted in a cumulative
aftertax increase to net income of approximately 40 million and an aftertax
reduction to other comprehensive income oci of approximately 170 million
which was recognized in earnings during 2002 and 2001 the adoption also
resulted in the recognition of 1780 million of assets and 2128 million of
liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet additionally the adoption
resulted in the reduction of hedged risk basis of 38 million and the
reclassification of deferred revenue to oci of 179 million

equity forward share purchase agreement

in 1999 nisource entered into an equity forward share purchase agreement that
qualified as permanent equity for accounting purposes the terms of the
agreement were designed to serve as an economic hedge for the shares that would
be issued pursuant to equity forward share sales agreements that were a part of
the corporate pies as the purchase agreement represented a forward purchase of
equity shares nisource had committed to a price for the acquisition of a
prescribed number of shares at a future date nisource terminated the agreement
at the end of 2000 with a final settlement date in early 2001 due to the
termination nisource recorded the fair value of the agreement as an asset of
44 million with a corresponding increase to stockholders equity as of
december 31 2000 during the first quarter of 2001 through the settlement
date nisource recognized 21 million in earnings associated with marking the
agreement to fair value

requirements discussed below that have had and may continue to have
significant impacts on nisources results of operations and consolidated balance
sheets

sfas no 71  accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation sfas
no 71 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation sfas no
71 provides that rateregulated subsidiaries account for and report assets and
liabilities consistent with the economic effect of the way in which regulators
establish rates if the rates established are designed to recover the costs of
providing the regulated service and if the competitive environment makes it
probable that such rates can be charged and collected nisources rateregulated
subsidiaries follow the accounting and reporting requirements of sfas no 71
certain expenses and credits subject to utility regulation or rate determination
normally reflected in income are deferred on the balance sheet and are
recognized in income as the related amounts are included in service rates and
recovered from or refunded to customers the total amounts of regulatory assets
and liabilities reflected on the consolidated balance sheets were 9066 million
and 1093 million at december 31 2002 and 8268 million and 1582 million
at december 31 2001 respectively

in the event that regulation significantly changes the opportunity for nisource
to recover its costs in the future all or a portion of nisources regulated
operations may no longer meet the criteria for the application of sfas no 71
in such event a writedown of all or a portion of nisources existing
regulatory assets and liabilities could result if transition cost recovery is
approved by the appropriate regulatory bodies that would meet the requirements
under generally accepted accounting principles for continued accounting as
regulatory assets and liabilities during such recovery period the regulatory
assets and liabilities would be reported at the recoverable amounts if unable
to continue to apply the provisions of sfas no 71 nisource would be required
to apply the provisions of sfas no 101 regulated enterprises  accounting for
the discontinuation of application of fasb statement no 71 in managements
opinion nisources regulated subsidiaries will be subject to sfas no 71 for
the foreseeable future

certain of the regulatory assets reflected on nisources consolidated balance
sheets require specific regulatory action in order to be included in future
service rates although recovery of these amounts is not guaranteed nisource
believes that these costs meet the requirements for deferral as regulatory
assets under sfas no 71 regulatory assets requiring specific regulatory action
amounted to 1573 million at december 31 2002 if nisource determined that the
amounts included as regulatory assets were not recoverable a charge to income
would immediately be required to the extent of the unrecoverable amounts

hedging activities under sfas no 133 the accounting for changes in the fair
value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and
resulting designation unrealized and realized gains and losses are recognized
each period as components of other comprehensive income regulatory assets and
liabilities or earnings depending on the nature of such derivatives for
subsidiaries that utilize derivatives for cash flow hedges the effective
portions of the gains and losses are recorded to other comprehensive income and
are recognized in earnings concurrent with the disposition of the hedged risks
for fair value hedges the gains and losses are recorded in earnings each period
along with the change in the fair value of the hedged item as a result of the
ratemaking process the rateregulated subsidiaries generally record gains and
losses as regulatory liabilities or assets and recognize such gains or losses in
earnings when recovered in revenues

in order for a derivative contract to be designated as a hedge the relationship
between the hedging instrument and the hedged item or transaction must be highly
effective the effectiveness test is performed at the inception of the hedge and
each reporting period thereafter throughout the period that the hedge is
designated any amounts determined to be ineffective are recorded currently in
earnings

although nisource applies some judgment in the assessment of hedge effectiveness
to designate certain derivatives as hedges the nature of the contracts used to
hedge the underlying risks is such that the correlation of the changes in fair
values of the derivatives and underlying risks is high nisource generally uses
nymex exchangetraded natural gas futures and options contracts and
overthecounter swaps based on published indices to hedge the risks underlying
its naturalgasrelated businesses nisource had 1671 million of price risk
management assets and 317 million of price risk management liabilities
primarily related to cash flow hedges at december 31 2002 the amount of
unrealized gains recorded to other comprehensive income was 678 million at
december 31 2002

accounting for energy trading activities energy trading activities refers to
energy contracts entered into with the objective of generating profits on or
from exposure to shifts or changes in market prices nisource evaluates the
contracts of its trading operations in accordance with the criteria for
derivative contracts under sfas no 133 through 2002 contracts not meeting the
criteria under sfas no 133 were recorded at fair value under emerging issues
task force issue no 9810 accounting for energy trading and risk management
activities eitf no 9810

pursuant to eitf no 9810 when certain trading criteria are met energy
contracts including energyrelated contracts such as tolling transportation
and storage contracts should be accounted for at fair value marked to market
along with any related derivative contracts recognizing related gains and
losses currently in earnings during an october 25 2002 eitf meeting eitf no
9810 was rescinded effective immediately for contracts entered into after that
date and after december 31 2002 for existing trading contracts

while the assessment of fair values for nisources trading contracts have been
mainly based on pricing information for exchangetraded contracts
transportation and storage agreements related to gas trading deals entered into
prior to the cessation of gas trading activities were marked to fair value based
on the results of internal models no estimates of fair values on transportation
and storage contracts related to gas trading activities remained as of december
31 2002 due to the sale or expiration of all gastrading related agreements
during the year in addition power trading options were marked to fair value
through earnings based on internal calculations of fair value employing the
widelyused blackscholes option pricing model at december 31 2002 the fair
value of the marktofairvalue options outstanding was a loss of 02
million

at december 31 2002 and 2001 nisource reflected 164 million and 2523
million of price risk management assets and 164 million and 2434 million of
price risk management liabilities related to unrealized gains and losses on
trading activities respectively

pensions and postretirement benefits nisource has defined benefit plans for
both pensions and other postretirement benefits the plans are accounted for
under sfas no 87 employers accounting for pensions and sfas no 106
employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions the
calculation of the net obligations and annual expense related to the plans
requires a significant degree of judgment regarding the discount rates to be
used in bringing the liabilities to present value longterm returns on plan
assets and employee longevity amongst other assumptions due to the size of
the plans and the longterm nature of the associated liabilities changes in
the assumptions used in the actuarial estimates could have material impacts on
the measurement of the net obligations and annual expense recognition for
further discussion of nisources pensions and other postretirement benefits see
note 11 of the notes to consolidated financial statements

union strike settlement

in september 2002 employee members of the paper alliedindustrial chemical
and energy workers union locals 50372 and 50628 ratified a fiveyear contract
from columbia transmission cnr and columbia gas of kentucky employees covered
by the collective bargaining agreement at all three companies resumed work
september 24 2002 after a work stoppage that began august 28 2002 the strike
did not have a material impact on nisources results of operations

insurance renewal

nisource experienced increases in premiums averaging 44 with additional
increases in deductibles and retentions along with added restrictions to
coverage and capacity for its property and casualty insurance program from 2001
to 2002 indications are that the upward trend in insurance costs will continue
in the foreseeable future this upward trend is driven by the overall poor
underwriting experience of the insurance industry over the past few years in
conjunction with the overall downturn of the capital markets and the economy
which drives the need for underwriters to seek higher premiums and further
restrict coverage

presentation of segment information

nisources operations are divided into five primary business segments gas

gas distribution operations continued

competition

gas distribution competes with investorowned municipal and cooperative
electric utilities throughout its service area and to a lesser extent with
other regulated natural gas utilities and propane and fuel oil suppliers gas
distribution continues to be a strong competitor in the energy market as a
result of strong customer preference for natural gas competition with providers
of electricity is generally strongest in the residential and commercial markets
of kentucky southern ohio southwestern pennsylvania and western virginia where
electric rates are primarily driven by lowcost coalfired generation gas
competes with fuel oil and propane in the new england markets mainly due to the
installed base of fuel oil and propanebased heating which over time has
comprised a dwindling percentage of the overall market

restructuring

during 2002 nisource carried out a new reorganization initiative which
resulted in the elimination of approximately 450 positions throughout all
nisource segments mainly affecting executive and other managementlevel
employees gas distribution accrued approximately 78 million of salaries
benefits and facilities costs associated with the reorganization initiative the
charge included 24 million related to the consolidation of facilities
affecting leased office space in richmond virginia and mount lebanon
pennsylvania additionally during 2002 the restructuring accrual was decreased
by 07 million related to previous reorganization initiatives

regulatory matters

changes in gas industry regulation which began in the mid1980s at the federal
level has broadened to retail customers at the state level large industrial
and commercial customers have had the ability to purchase natural gas directly
from marketers and to use gas distributions facilities for transportation
services for many years this opportunity to choose an alternative supplier has
been migrating into the small commercial and residential customer classes with
approved or pilot transportation programs being used in 8 of the 9 states served
by gas distribution as of december 31 2002 approximately 07 million of gas
distributions residential and commercial customers had selected an alternate
supplier

gas distribution continues to explore customer choice opportunities through
regulatory initiatives in all of its jurisdictions while these programs are
intended to provide all customer classes with the opportunity to obtain gas
supplies from alternative merchants gas distribution expects to play a
substantial role in supplying gas commodity services to its customers in the
foreseeable future as customers enroll in these programs and purchase their gas
from other suppliers the gas distribution subsidiaries are sometimes left with
pipeline capacity they have contracted for but no longer need the state
commissions in jurisdictions served by gas distribution are at various stages in
addressing these issues and other transition considerations gas distribution is
currently recovering or has the opportunity to recover the costs resulting
from the unbundling of its services and believes that most of such future costs
will be mitigated or recovered methodologies for mitigating or recovering
transition costs include incentive sharing mechanisms reducing levels of
reserved pipeline capacity and mandatory assignment of pipeline capacity to
alternative suppliers

in december 1999 the public utilities commission of ohio puco approved a
request from columbia gas of ohio that extends columbia of ohios customer
choicesm program through october 31 2004 freezes base rates through october
31 2004 and resolves the issue of transition costs from pipeline capacity
under the agreement columbia of ohio assumes total financial risk for
mitigation of transition capacity costs at no additional cost to customers
columbia of ohio has the opportunity to utilize nontraditional revenue sources
as a means of offsetting the costs

on november 20 2001 the puco issued final rules to implement the provisions of
choice legislation enacted by the ohio general assembly on march 27 2001 the
rules have been approved by a joint committee on agency rule review of the ohio
legislature and were effective on july 5 2002 the new rules establish the
process for puco certification and regulation of competitive retail natural gas
suppliers establish minimum service standards for competitive natural gas
suppliers and specify the procedures for establishment of governmental
aggregation programs in which consumers have the right to optout of the
program columbia of ohio filed tariffs incorporating the rules on november 1
2002 a number of communities in the service territory of columbia of ohio have
passed aggregation initiatives in recent elections there are approximately 02
million eligible customers

in these communities two communities began governmental aggregation in late
2002 and it is anticipated that other communities will begin the governmental
aggregations in 2003

as part of the kentucky public service commission kpsc order approving the
acquisition of columbia columbia gas of kentucky inc columbia gas of
kentucky was required to file a rate case that included an estimate of net
merger savings and a mechanism to reflect merger savings on customers bills on
may 1 2002 columbia gas of kentucky filed a general rate case requesting an
increase in revenue of approximately 25 million or 4 of annual operating
revenues including the net merger savings on september 30 2002 columbia gas
of kentucky and all other parties of record in this proceeding filed a
settlement with the kpsc the settlement was approved by the kpsc on december
13 2002 the settlement reduces columbia gas of kentuckys base rates by 78
million with 05 million of the reduction recovered through a tracking
mechanism to cover the costs of a program to support lowincome customers the
changes become effective in march 2003

in november 2001 northern utilities new hampshire nunh filed a general rate
case requesting an increase in revenue of approximately 38 million or 7 of
annual operating revenues in february 2002 nunh received approval of interim
rates designed to generate an additional 23 million in revenues annually to
be applied to gas consumed on and after february 7 2002 in september 2002
nunh and all parties in this proceeding filed a settlement with the new
hampshire public utilities commission nhpuc that will increase rates by
approximately 11 million on october 28 the nhpuc issued an order approving
the settlement with new permanent rates effective as of november 1 2002 nunh
will refund to customers approximately 05 million which is the difference
between the revenue collected from the interim increase generated from
temporary rates reduced by the approved rate case expenses and the lower
revenues based on the permanent rates for the period from february 7 to november
1 the net amount will be refunded to customers over the 12month period from
november 2002 through october 2003

on august 11 1999 the iurc approved a flexible gas cost adjustment mechanism
for northern indiana under the new procedure the demand component of the
adjustment factor will be determined after hearings and iurc approval and made
effective on november 1 of each year the demand component will remain in effect
for one year until a new demand component is approved by the iurc the commodity
component of the adjustment factor will be determined by monthly filings which
will become effective on the first day of each calendar month subject to
refund the monthly filings do not require iurc approval but will be reviewed by
the iurc during the annual hearing that will take place regarding the demand
component filing northern indianas gas cost adjustment factor also includes a
gas cost incentive mechanism which allows the sharing of any cost savings or
cost increases with customers based on a comparison of actual gas supply
portfolio cost to a marketbased benchmark price northern indiana made its
annual filing on august 29 2002 the iurc approved implementation of interim
rates subject to refund effective november 1 2002 another party has filed
testimony indicating that some gas costs should not be recovered a hearing is
scheduled for march 13 2003 management intends to vigorously oppose any
efforts to reduce the recovery of gas costs

ferc order 637

the ferc issued order 637 on february 9 2000 the order sets forth revisions to
the previous regulatory framework to improve the competitiveness and the
efficiency of the interstate natural gas transportation market it effects
changes in regulations relating to scheduling procedures pipeline penalties
pricing transparency new pipeline service offerings capacity release
capabilities new reporting requirements and various other servicerelated
issues intended to enhance competition in the industry since the order was
issued pipelines have made pro forma filings to comply gas distribution has
actively engaged in settlement discussions with all of its pipeline suppliers as
well as with other major customers on those pipeline systems in an effort to
resolve pertinent issues

to date only a few of gas distributions pipeline suppliers have been able to
reach an agreement with customers and implement fercapproved settlements most
of the major pipeline suppliers to gas distribution made revised pro forma
compliance filings which have been approved by ferc but have not been
implemented because of pending requests for rehearing also as a result of a
legal challenge to order no 637 the dc circuit court of appeals reversed and
remanded to ferc some aspects of order no 637 but did not upset order no 637
generally or require broad changes to how pipelines implement the rule

gas distribution operations continued

based upon orders from ferc on some pipelines compliance filings and the slowed
progress by ferc gas distribution believes that full implementation of order
637 will not generally begin to take place prior to the winter of 2003  2004
additionally based upon gas distributions experience to date and fercs
guidance regarding the effect of order no 637 on various aspects of pipeline
operations as well as the degree of compromise that occurred from all segments
of the industry management believes that while full implementation of order no
637 will result in some additional competition for gas distribution with regard
to gas supply cost management and competition from market entrants that do not
have supplier of last resort obligations it will not have a material effect
upon gas distribution costs operations or income

environmental matters

remediation several gas distribution subsidiaries are potentially responsible
parties prps at waste disposal sites under the comprehensive environmental
response compensation and liability act cercla commonly known as superfund
and similar state laws including at former manufactured gas plant mgp sites
which such subsidiaries or their corporate predecessors own or previously
owned or operated gas distribution subsidiaries may be required to share in the
cost of clean up of such sites in addition some gas distribution subsidiaries
have corrective action liability under the resource conservation and recovery
act rcra for closure and cleanup costs associated with underground storage
tanks and under the toxic substances control act for clean up of polychlorinated
biphenyls released at various facilities

gas distribution subsidiaries are parties to or otherwise involved in clean up
of three waste disposal sites under superfund or similar state laws for one of
these sites the potential liability is de minimis and for the other two the
final costs of clean up have not yet been determined as site investigations and
cleanups proceed and as additional information becomes available the waste
disposal site liability is reviewed and adjusted as necessary

a program has been instituted to identify and investigate former mgp sites where
gas distribution subsidiaries or predecessors are the current or former owner
the program has identified 84 such sites initial investigation has been
conducted at 40 sites of these sites additional investigation activities have
been completed or are in progress at 34 sites and remedial measures have been
implemented or completed at 21 sites only those site investigation
characterization and remediation costs currently known and determinable can be
considered probable and reasonably estimable under sfas no 5 accounting for
contingencies sfas no 5 as costs become probable and reasonably estimable
reserves will be adjusted as appropriate as reserves are recorded regulatory
assets are recorded to the extent environmental expenditures are expected to be
recovered through rates nisource is unable at this time to accurately
estimate the time frame and potential costs of the entire program management
expects that as characterization is completed additional remediation work is
performed and more facts become available nisource will be able to develop a
probable and reasonable estimate for the entire program or a major portion
thereof consistent with the security exchange commissions staff accounting
bulletin no 92 sab no 92 which covers accounting and disclosures relating to
loss contingencies sfas no 5 and american institute of certified public
accountants statement of position 961 environmental remediation liabilities
sop no 961

as of december 31 2002 a reserve of approximately 659 million has been
recorded to cover probable environmental response actions the ultimate
liability in connection with these sites will depend upon many factors
including the volume of material contributed to the site years of ownership or
operation the number of other prps and their financial viability and the extent
of environmental response actions required based upon investigations and
managements understanding of current environmental laws and regulations
nisource believes that any environmental response actions required after
consideration of insurance coverage contributions from other prps and rate
recovery will not have a material effect on its financial position

market conditions

in the winter of 20002001 us wellhead gas prices peaked at over 800 per
dekatherm dth the unprecedented high prices were due primarily to tight
supply and increased demand during this period demand was higher than in
previous periods due to the continued economic expansion in 2000 proliferation
of gasfired electric generation and record cold weather during november and
december 2000 lower production coupled with increased demand resulted in lower
storage levels of natural gas entering the 20002001 winter heating season

the economic slowdown during 2001 contributed to lower demand reduced
industrial production and fuel switching to coal heating oil and distillate
resulted in industrial throughput falling 25 from its peak of over 400 billion
cubic feet bcf the steel industry which has historically represented over
twothirds of the industrial throughput in indiana and over onethird of the
industrial throughput in the major markets of ohio pennsylvania and kentucky
was particularly hard hit with a number of companies filing for bankruptcy

responding to higher natural gas prices producers increased drilling activity
recording a record number of natural gas well completions during 2001 the
increased production from these new wells along with the 2001 economic slowdown
combined to create a brief period of excess gas supplies these factors coupled
with a nearrecord warm 20012002 winter heating season resulted in prices for
the 20012002 winter declining to levels generally experienced during the 1990s
as natural gas prices in 2001 began declining producers reduced the number of
drilling rigs in operation this reduction in active drilling rigs resulted in
fewer wells being drilled and a decline in production during the latter part of
2002 responding to lower drilling activity and increased demand from natural
gas fired electric generation facilities natural gas prices began to increase
in early 2002 and continued to increase through the end of the year

spot prices for the current winter period as represented by prices on the
nymex are in the 400600dth range significantly higher than the prices
experienced during the 20012002 winter season entering this winter storage
levels were near the top of the fiveyear range however concerns over lower
levels of natural gas production and nearnormal temperatures have sustained
higher prices midway through the 20022003 winter season natural gas storage
has returned to levels slightly below the trailing fiveyear average given the
reduced level of storage and lower projected production natural gas prices are
expected to continue at or near their current level through this winter heating
season to date the higher prices of late 2002 and early 2003 have not resulted
in indications of increased levels of drilling recent drilling activity has
been relatively stable from midyear 2002 at levels approximately onethird
lower than the peak reached during 2001

all nisource gas distribution companies have stateapproved recovery mechanisms
that provide a means for full recovery of prudently incurred gas costs gas
costs are treated as passthrough costs and have no impact on the net revenues
recorded in the period the gas costs included in revenues are matched with the
gas cost expense recorded in the period and the difference is recorded on the
balance sheet to be included in future customer billings

the gas distribution companies have pursued nontraditional revenue sources
within the evolving natural gas marketplace these efforts include both the sale
of products and services upstream of its service territory the sale of products
and services in its service territories and gas supply cost incentive mechanisms
for service to its core markets the upstream products are made up of
transactions that occur between the gas distribution company and a buyer for the
sales of unbundled or rebundled gas supply and capacity products the onsystem
services are offered by nisource to customers and include products such as the
transportation and balancing of gas on the gas distribution company system the
incentive mechanisms give the gas distribution companies an opportunity to share
in the savings created from such things as gas purchase prices paid below an
agreed upon benchmark and its ability to reduce pipeline capacity charges the
treatment of the revenues generated from these types of transactions vary by
operating company with some sharing the benefits with customers and others using
these revenues to mitigate transition costs occurring as the result of choice
programs described above under regulatory matters

capital expenditures

the gas distribution segments net capital expenditure program was 1964
million in 2002 and is projected to be approximately 1956 million in 2003 new
business initiatives totaled approximately 815 million in 2002 and are
expected to be 773 million in 2003 the remaining expenditures are for
modernizing and upgrading facilities

weather

weather in the gas distribution service territories for 2002 was 7 warmer than
normal and 6 colder than 2001 increasing net revenues by approximately 218
million over 2001

gas distribution operations continued

in 2001 weather in the gas distribution service territories was 13 warmer than
normal this negatively impacted the deliveries primarily to residential and
commercial customers by approximately 360 million dekatherms mdth versus 2000
and reduced net revenues by approximately 630 million

throughput

total volumes sold and transported of 9238 mdth for 2002 decreased 830 mdth
from 2001 this decrease was primarily due to a decrease in offsystem sales

for 2001 total volumes sold and transported of 10068 mdth increased 4674
mdth from 2000 the acquisition of columbia contributed 5508 mdth of additional
throughput this increase was partially offset by the impact of the economic
decline on industrial demand primarily from the steel industry additionally
the warmer weather reduced current period throughput by 357 mdth

net revenues

net revenues for 2002 were 13888 million down 36 million from 2001 mainly
as a result of a decrease in offsystem sales and incentive programs amounting
to 243 million mostly offset by 218 million as a result of colder weather
as compared to 2001

net revenues for 2001 were 13924 million up 6564 million over 2000 the
acquisition of columbia generated higher net revenues of 6628 million
partially offset by warmer weather

operating income

for the twelve months ended december 31 2002 operating income for the gas
distribution operations was 4591 million an increase of 783 million over
the same period in 2001 the increase was a result of favorable weather of 218
million and 819 million from lower operating expenses mainly resulting from
discontinuing the amortization of goodwill of 428 million 245 million of
insurance recoveries for environmental expenses decreased employeerelated and
support services expenses resulting from reorganization initiatives of 193
million and reductions of 92 million in reduced uncollectible customer
accounts and other customer related expenses the favorable variances were
partially offset by a decrease of 243 million in offsystem sales and
incentive programs

for the twelve months ended december 31 2001 operating income for the gas
distribution operations was 3808 million an increase of 1398 million over
the same period in 2000 reflecting the benefit of twelve months of columbia
operations compared to two months in 2000 the increase was tempered by record
setting warmerthannormal weather that reduced operating income by
approximately 630 million a 360 million increase in amortization of
goodwill associated with the acquisition of columbia and 234 million for
restructuring costs in addition uncollectibles increased 131 million over
the prior year primarily resulting from the higher cost of gas during the
20002001 winter heating period the negative variance was reduced by the impact
of a favorable order that allows for regulatory treatment of customer bad debts
totaling approximately 195 million

proposed millennium pipeline project

the proposed millennium pipeline project millennium in which columbia
transmission is participating and will serve as developer and operator will
transport western gas supplies to northeast and midatlantic markets the
442mile pipeline will connect to canadian facilities at a new lake erie export
point and transport approximately 700 mdth per day to eastern markets in august
2001 transcanada pipelines ltd and st clair pipelines ltd the sponsors of
the proposed upstream canadian facilities to the lake erie export point
withdrew their pending applications before canadas national energy board for
approval of the proposed facilities without prejudice to refiling at a later
date the withdrawal notice cited the delays encountered in millenniums ferc
proceedings on december 19 2001 the ferc issued a certificate approving the
construction and operation of the pipeline subject to a number of conditions
including a condition that construction may not commence until any necessary
canadian authorizations were obtained rehearing requests were filed on january
18 2002

on september 19 2002 the ferc issued its order granting final certificate
authority for the project the order largely supports the finding of the
december 19 2001 certificate order and holds that the ferc adequately complied
with the requirements of the national environmental policy act in approving the
project the order specifies that millennium may not begin construction until
the required approvals from canadas national energy board and other agencies
are received and certain environmental and other conditions are met one such
condition is compliance with the coastal zone management act which is
administered by the state of new yorks department of state nydos nydos has
determined that the project is not consistent with the act and millennium has
appealed that decision to the united states department of commerce to date a
number of shippers have signed agreements for a portion of the available
capacity millennium is in ongoing discussions with potential shippers regarding
the extent and timing of their needs

transportation for new electric generation projects

columbia transmission received approval from the ferc to construct facilities to
provide service at levels up to 560 mdth per day to three electric generating
facilities scheduled to be in service in 2003 due to market conditions
customers at two of the proposed electric generation facilities have elected to
terminate underlying contracts for service and plans for these facilities have
been terminated however columbias plans to serve a 1020megawatt generating
facility in maryland with up to 270 mdth per day are progressing and service is
anticipated to begin in 2003

pipeline firm service contracts

since implementation of order 636 in the early 1990s the services of columbia
transmission and columbia gulf have consisted of open access transportation
services and open access storage services in the case of columbia transmission
these services are provided primarily to ldcs and compete to some degree with
comparable services provided by other interstate pipelines the majority of the
firm contracts that were restructured in order 636 expire in late 2004 customer
decisions on capacity resubscription are affected by many factors including
decisions by state regulators on the treatment of pipeline capacity agreements
in the context of ldc unbundling proceedings the companies have commenced the
process for negotiating for resubscription of the firm capacity

restructuring

during the third quarter of 2002 nisource carried out a new reorganization
initiative which resulted in the elimination of approximately 450 positions
throughout all nisource segments mainly affecting executive and other
managementlevel employees during 2002 gas transmission and storage accrued
approximately 148 million of salaries benefits and facilities costs
associated with the reorganization initiative

environmental matters

columbia transmission continues to conduct characterization and remediation
activities at specific sites under a 1995 environmental protection agency epa
administrative order by consent aoc the program pursuant to the aoc covers
approximately 240 facilities approximately 13000 liquid removal points
approximately 2200 mercury measurement stations and about 3700 storage well
locations field characterization had been performed at all sites site
characterization reports and remediation plans which must be submitted to the
epa for approval are in various stages of development and completion
remediation has been completed at the mercury measurement stations liquid
removal point sites and storage well locations and at a number of the 240
facilities

only those site investigation characterization and remediation costs currently
known and determinable can be considered probable and reasonably estimable
under sfas no 5 as costs become probable and reasonably estimable the
associated reserves will be adjusted as appropriate during 2002 columbia
transmission completed a sufficient number of the characterization reports and
remediation plans to adjust its original estimate for the entire program as a
result the liability was reduced by 155 million the estimate may be adjusted
as additional work is completed consistent with sab no 92 sfas no 5 and sop
no 961

columbia transmission and columbia gulf are prps at several waste disposal
sites the potential liability is believed to be de minimis however the final
allocation of cleanup costs has yet to be determined as site investigations
and cleanups proceed and as additional information becomes available waste
disposal site liability is reviewed periodically and adjusted

at december 31 2002 the remaining environmental liability recorded on the
balance sheet of gas transmission was 613 million future expenditures will be
charged against the previously recorded liability a regulatory asset has been
recorded to the extent environmental expenditures are expected to be recovered
through rates management does not believe that columbia transmissions
environmental expenditures will have a material adverse effect on nisources
operations liquidity or financial position based on known facts existing

lost and unaccounted for gas

on march 28 2002 the ferc issued an order affirming its earlier holdings
rejecting challenges to columbia transmissions ability to recover certain lost
and unaccountedfor gas in its annual retainage adjustment mechanism ram
filing in addition the ferc had previously directed columbia transmission to
file information requested by interveners in its last annual ram proceeding
columbia transmission provided the information in the annual filing made on
march 1 2002 on september 10 2002 the ferc issued an order accepting the
information filed by columbia transmission this order effectively closed
columbia transmissions 2001 and 2000 ram proceedings

storage base gas sales

base gas represents storage volumes that are maintained to ensure that adequate
pressure exists to deliver current gas inventory as a result of ongoing
improvements made in its storage operations columbia transmission determined
that a portion of these storage volumes were no longer necessary to maintain
deliverability columbia transmission sold 20 mdth and 54 mdth of storage base
gas volumes during 2002 and 2001 respectively these sales resulted in pretax
gains of 29 million and 114 million in 2002 and 2001 respectively

longterm notes receivable

in 1999 columbia transmission sold certain gathering facilities to a third
party for approximately 22 million the buyer executed a promissory note which
provides for payment of the purchase price to columbia transmission over a
fiveyear period in the second quarter of 2002 an appropriate reserve was
recorded against the receivable in light of the failure to receive timely
payments from the counterparty during the third quarter management was able to
negotiate a new payment schedule and secure a guarantee from the third partys
parent company as security for the note at december 31 2002 the balance of
the note was 88 million

capital expenditure program

the gas transmission and storage segments net capital expenditure program was
1280 million in 2002 and is projected to be approximately 1357 million in
2003 new business initiatives totaled approximately 270 million in 2002 and
are expected to be 303 million in 2003 the remaining expenditures are for
modernizing and upgrading facilities

throughput

columbia transmissions throughput consists of transportation and storage
services for ldcs and other customers within its market area which covers
portions of northeastern midatlantic midwestern and southern states and the
district of columbia throughput for columbia gulf reflects mainline
transportation services from rayne louisiana to leach kentucky and shorthaul
transportation services from the gulf of mexico to rayne louisiana crossroads
serves customers in northern indiana and ohio and granite state provides service
in new hampshire maine and massachusetts

throughput for the gas transmission and storage segment totaled 13143 mdth for
2002 compared to 12413 mdth in 2001 the increase of 730 mdth reflected
slightly colder weather in 2002 and an increase in market demand

throughput for the gas transmission and storage segment totaled 12413 mdth for
2001 compared to 3954 mdth in 2000 the increase of 8459 mdth primarily
reflected the addition of columbia transmission and columbia gulf as a result of
the acquisition of columbia

net revenues

net revenues were 8744 million for 2002 a decrease of 92 million from 2001
the decrease was primarily due to an 85 million reduction in gains on the
sales of storage base gas that occurred in the 2002 and 2001 periods

net revenues were 8836 million for 2001 an increase of 7145 million from
2000 due to the inclusion of columbias operations for a full twelve months in
2001 compared to two months in 2000 also contributing to the increase was a
gain of 114 million from the sale of base gas

operating income

operating income of 3983 million in 2002 increased 493 million from 2001
the increase was due primarily to the effects of discontinuing the amortization
of 503 million of goodwill a 100 million reduction in reserves for
estimated environmental expenditures and lower employeerelated and support
services expenses approximating 136 million the favorable impacts were partly
offset by 85 million from lower gains on the sales of storage base gas that
occurred in the 2002 and 2001 periods and expenses related to nisources
reorganization initiatives totaling 148 million

operating income of 3490 million in 2001 increased 3033 million from 2000
this increase was due primarily to the inclusion of columbias operations for
twelve months partially offset by an increase of 422 million for the
amortization of goodwill related to the columbia acquisition in addition the
2001 results compare favorably to 2000 due to a gain of 114 million on the
sale of storage base gas and the negative impact for an asset impairment
recognized in 2000

market conditions

the regulatory frameworks applicable to electric operations continue to be
affected by fundamental changes these changes will continue to have an impact
on electric operations structure and profitability at the same time
competition within the industry will create opportunities to compete for new
customers and revenues management has taken steps to improve operating
efficiencies in this changing environment and improve the transmission
interconnections with neighboring electric utilities

the economic situation in the steel and steelrelated industries continues to
have an impact on electric sales the indiana facilities of ltv corporation
ltv which declared bankruptcy were acquired by international steel group
isg in early 2002 production levels at the isg plant have gradually increased
during 2002 but were down overall for the year resulting in decreased sales
although sales to the steel industry remained lower than normal overall sales
to the steel industry increased 673 gigawatt hours gwh during the 2002 period
as compared with 2001

restructuring

during the third quarter of 2002 nisource carried out a new reorganization
initiative which resulted in the elimination of approximately 450 positions
throughout all nisource segments mainly affecting executive and other
managementlevel employees during 2002 electric operations accrued
approximately 25 million of salaries and benefits associated with the
reorganization initiative additionally during 2002 the restructuring accrual
was reduced by 35 million related to previous reorganization initiatives

regulatory matters

on june 20 2002 a settlement agreement was filed with the iurc regarding the
northern indiana electric rate review on september 23 2002 the iurc issued an
order adopting most aspects of the settlement the order provides that electric
customers of northern indiana will receive an amount intended to approximate
550 million each year in credits to their electric bills for 49 months
beginning on july 1 2002 the order also provides that 60 of any future
earnings beyond a specified cap will be retained by northern indiana pursuant
to the iurc order northern indiana as authorized began to amortize onehalf
of its expenses for this proceeding over a 49month period the remaining
expenses were charged to income in the third quarter of 2002

on october 23 2002 the iurc denied a petition for reconsideration of the
settlement order filed on october 15 2002 by fourteen residential customers
therefore northern indiana electric customers began to receive credits starting
with their november monthly bill the november bill included credits for the
customers consumption beginning on july 1 2002 credits amounting to 281
million were recognized for electric customers for 2002 in addition the order
required northern indiana to establish and fund an escrow account to cover the
litigation costs of certain of the parties to the electric rate review the
escrow account was established and fully funded with 18 million in the fourth
quarter the order adopting the settlement is currently being appealed to the
indiana court of appeals by both the citizen action coalition of indiana and the
fourteen residential customers

northern indiana submitted its quarterly fuel adjustment clause filing for the
twelvemonth period ended september 30 2002 which requires a sharing of
earnings in excess of allowed earnings as outlined in the iurc order regarding
the electric rate review settlement the iurc issued an order related to the
filing on january 29 2002 taking exception to northern indianas proposed
sharing calculation the proposed calculation prorated the amount to be shared
with the customers based on the amount of time the rate credit was in effect
during the twelvemonth period northern indiana has filed with the iurc a
request for a rehearing and reconsideration of the order in that proceeding
northern indiana believes its calculation for the amount of sharing is
appropriate regardless of the outcome the settlement of this issue will not
have a material impact on nisources financial position or results of
operations

in 1999 the ferc issued order 2000 addressing the formation and operation of
rtos on february 28 2001 northern indiana joined the alliance rto on
december 18 2001 the iurc issued an order denying northern indianas request
to transfer functional control of its transmission facilities to the alliance
rto on december 20 2001 the ferc reversed prior orders that had preliminarily
approved the alliance rto and concluded that the alliance rto failed to meet
order 2000s scope and configuration requirements ferc ordered the alliance rto
companies including northern indiana to pursue membership in the midwest
independent system operator miso on june 20 2002 northern indiana ameren
corporation and first energy corporation established terms for joining the miso
through participation in an independent transmission company the miso
arrangements were filed with the ferc and on july 31 2002 the ferc issued an
order conditionally approving these arrangements on november 5 2002 the
independent transmission company itc which includes northern indiana signed
an agreement with miso northern indiana has expended approximately 82 million
related to joining an rto nisource believes that the amounts spent will be
reimbursed as a result of the finalization of the itc agreement and ferc
approval

northern indiana has been recovering the costs of electric power purchased for
sale to its customers through the fuel adjustment clause the fuel adjustment
clause provides for costs to be collected if they are below a cap that is set
based upon the costs of northern indianas most expensive generating unit if
costs exceed this cap northern indiana must demonstrate that the costs were
prudently incurred to achieve approval for recovery in january 2002 northern
indiana filed for approval to implement a purchase power tracker ppt the ppt
would allow recovery of all costs related to purchasing electricity for use by
northern indianas customers on a periodic basis no actions have been taken by
the iurc on this filing

in january 2002 northern indiana filed for approval to implement an
environmental cost tracker ect on june 20 2002 northern indiana and the
office of utility consumer counselor filed an ect stipulation and settlement
agreement ect settlement agreement which resolved all issues in the
proceeding under the ect settlement agreement northern indiana will be able to
recover 1 allowance for funds used during construction and a return on the
capital investment expended by northern indiana to implement indiana department
of environmental managements nitrogen oxide state implementation plan and 2
related operation and maintenance and depreciation expenses once the
environmental facilities become operational the iurc approved the settlement on
november 26 2002 northern indiana made its initial filing for the ect in
february 2003

in 1995 northern indiana filed an open access transmission tariff oatt in ferc
docket no er96399 with ferc as required in ferc order no 888 the oatt
established subject to refund rates that northern indiana could charge all of
its customers for transmission of electric power across northern indianas
electric transmission facilities the ferc established an administrative
proceeding before one of its administrative law judges to examine the filing and
to inquire into the appropriateness of the rates although the proceeding
continued to litigation with regard to certain customers northern indiana
reached a settlement with its largest transmission customer wabash valley power
association wvpa which established rates to be charged to wvpa and eliminated
any refund liability on behalf of northern indiana for transmission service
provided to wvpa in the remaining portion of the proceeding on december 30
2002 the ferc issued an order that among other things reduced the rate base
and rate of return allowed to northern indiana regarding its oatt thus creating
a refund liability for northern indiana northern indiana did not seek rehearing
of the fercs december 30 2002 order thus under ferc procedures northern
indiana is required to submit a compliance filing currently due by march 17
2003 which will establish rates and services in compliance with the fercs order
and report on the magnitude of any refund liability resulting to northern
indiana as a result of the proceeding northern indiana is in the process of
determining the refund liability resulting from the ferc opinion

environmental matters

air in december 2001 the epa approved regulations developed by the state of
indiana to comply with epas nox state implementation plan sip call the nox
sip call requires certain states including indiana to reduce nox levels from
several sources including industrial and utility boilers to lower regional
transport of ozone the nox emission limitations in the indiana rules are more
restrictive than those imposed on electric utilities under the clean air act
amendments of 1990 caaa acid rain nox reduction program compliance with the
nox limits contained in these rules is required by may 31 2004 northern
indiana plans to install selective catalytic reduction nox reduction technology
at each of its active generating stations to comply with the rules and estimates
capital costs will range from 200 to 250 million actual compliance costs may
vary depending on a number of factors including market demandresource
constraints uncertainty of future equipment and construction costs and the
potential need for additional control technology

the epa issued final rules revising the national ambient air quality standards
for ozone and particulate matter in july 1997 these rules were widely
challenged on march 26 2002 the united states court of appeals for the dc
circuit largely upheld the ambient air standards as challenged consequently
designation of areas not attaining the standards promulgation of rules
specifying a compliance level compliance deadline and controls necessary for
compliance will be completed over the next few years which will likely change
air emissions compliance requirements resulting rules could require additional
reductions in sulfur dioxide particulate matter and nox emissions from
coalfired boilers including northern indianas electric generating stations
the epa and state regulatory authorities will set final implementation
requirements nisource believes that the costs relating to compliance with any
new limits may be substantial but are dependent upon the ultimate control
program agreed to by the targeted states and the epa and are currently not
reasonably estimable nisource will continue to closely

monitor developments in this area however the exact nature of the impact of
the new standards on its operations will not be known for some time

during 1999 the epa initiated enforcement actions against several electric
utilities alleging violations of the new source review provisions of the caaa
and subsequently has issued additional information collection requests to many
other utilities northern indiana has also received and responded to information
requests from the epa on this subject over the last two years most recently in
june 2002 at this time nisource is unable to predict the result of epas
review of northern indianas information responses

in november 2002 epa announced reforms to the new source review rules that
include two components the first a final rule does not appear to
significantly impact northern indiana however upon official publication of the
rules by epa on december 31 2002 nine northeastern states filed a legal
challenge against the final rule in the us district court of appeals for
district of columbia the second component is a proposed rule that is subject to
further public comment and revision before finalization therefore northern
indiana is unable at this time to evaluate its potential impacts on operations
northern indiana will continue to closely monitor the developments related to
both rules for potential impacts

initiatives are being discussed both in the united states and worldwide to
reduce socalled greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide a byproduct of
burning fossil fuels reduction of such emissions could result in significant
capital outlays or operating expenses for northern indiana

the caaa also contain other provisions that could lead to limitations on
emissions of hazardous air pollutants in response to the caaa requirements on
december 20 2000 the epa issued a finding that the regulation of emissions of
mercury and other air toxics from coal and oilfired electric steam generating
units is necessary and appropriate the epa expects to issue proposed
regulations by december 15 2003 and finalized regulations by december 15
2004 the potential impact if any to nisources financial results that may
occur because of any of these potential new regulations is unknown at this time

the epa is in the process of developing a program to address regional haze the
new bush administration announced that the epa would move forward with rules
that mandate the states to require power plants built between 1962 and 1977 to
install the best available retrofit technology bart the bart program will
target for control by 2013 those pollutants that limit visibility namely
particulate sulfur dioxide andor nitrogen oxides until the program is
developed northern indiana cannot predict the cost of complying with these
rules

water the great lakes water quality initiative gli program is expected to add
new water quality standards for facilities that discharge into the great lakes
watershed including northern indianas three electric generating stations
located on lake michigan the state of indiana has promulgated its regulations
for this water discharge permit program and has received final epa approval as
promulgated the regulations would provide the indiana department of
environmental management idem with the authority to grant water quality
criteria variances and exemptions for noncontact cooling water however the
epa revised the variance language and other minor provisions of idems gli rule
the epa by and large left the noncontact cooling water exemption intact
however a separate agreement between the epa and idem on interpretation of this
exemption still leaves uncertainty as to its impact the epa change to the
variance rule prompted litigation by the affected industrial parties and an
agreement on the noncontact cooling water exemption has been reached with
epaidem northern indiana expects that idem will issue a proposed permit
renewal for each of its lakeside stations pending issuance of these permits
the costs of complying with there requirements cannot be predicted at this time

remediation northern indiana is a prp at three waste disposal sites under
cercla and similar state laws and shares in the cost of their cleanup with
other prps at one site the remediation plan has been implemented and longterm
monitoring is ongoing at another site investigations are ongoing and final
costs of clean up have not yet been determined at the third site northern
indiana has recently entered into an epa administrative order on consent to
perform a removal action in the vicinity of a third party statepermitted
landfill where northern indiana contracted for fly ash disposal epa and idem
are currently evaluating the potential for remedial action at this site

as investigations and cleanups proceed at each of these sites and as
additional information becomes available waste disposal site liability is
reviewed periodically and adjusted in addition northern indiana has corrective
action liability under the rcra for closure and cleanup costs associated with
treatment storage and disposal sites as of december 31 2002 a reserve of
approximately 12 million has been recorded to cover probable environmental
response actions at these sites the ultimate liability in connection with these
sites will depend upon many factors including the volume of material
contributed to the site years of ownership of operations the number of other
prps and their financial viability and the extent of environmental response
required based upon investigations and managements understanding of current
environmental laws and regulations nisource believes that any environmental
response required will not have a material effect on the its financial position
or results of operations

capital expenditure program

the electric segments net capital expenditure program was 1978 million in
2002 and is projected to be approximately 2145 million in 2003 expenditures
for 2002 included improvements related to the operational integrity of
generation transmission and distribution assets expenditures related to
environmental compliance nox reduction and additions to electric distribution
systems related to new business estimated expenditures for 2003 are
approximately 1000 million for the nox compliance program the remaining
expenditures are for new business initiatives and maintenance programs

sales

electric sales for 2002 of 187759 gwh increased 24646 gwh compared to 2001
due to 27 warmer weather during the summer cooling season

electric sales for 2001 of 163113 gwh decreased 11816 gwh compared to 2000
due primarily to reduced industrial sales reflecting the economic downturn and
steel industry bankruptcies as well as reduced wholesale revenues partially
offset by the impact of warmer weather

net revenues

electric net revenues were 7684 million for 2002 a decrease of 185 million
from 2001 primarily as a result of 281 million in credits issued pertaining
to the iurc electric rate review settlement and 52 million from decreased
wholesale and wheeling net revenues the unfavorable variance was partially
offset by 148 million from warmer weather during the summer cooling season as
compared to 2001

electric net revenues for 2001 of 7869 million decreased by 112 million from
2000 primarily reflecting reduced deliveries to the industrial segment and
reduced wholesale revenues partially offset by warmer weather

operating income

operating income for 2002 was 3223 million a decrease of 184 million from
2001 the decrease was primarily a result of 281 million in credits issued
pertaining to the iurc electric rate review settlement and 52 million from
decreased wholesale and wheeling revenues partially offset by 148 million
from the favorable impact of warmer weather during the summer cooling season

operating income for 2001 was 3407 million a decrease of 123 million from
2000 the decrease was due to lower net revenues discussed above and higher
operating expenses of 11 million the 2001 operating expenses included
increased uncollectible expenses of 24 million restructuring charges of 52
million and increased depreciation expense and property taxes partially offset
by decreased employeerelated costs and reduced electric production operating
expenses

2002 cnr delivered 271 bcf to mahonia under the agreements cnr has made the
required physical deliveries in the past and has a remaining obligation to
deliver 1161 bcf of natural gas to mahonia through february 2006 cash received
in advance from sales of production to be delivered in the future was recorded
as deferred revenue and is recognized as income upon delivery of the natural
gas

deliveries for 2003 and beyond will be based on the following volumes and sales

volumes

gas production was 542 bcf in 2002 remaining flat as compared with the prior
year oil and liquids production was 206400 barrels in 2002 and 224300 barrels
in 2001

gas production was 541 bcf in 2001 and 95 bcf in the last two months of 2000
oil and liquids production was 224300 barrels in 2001 and 26500 barrels in the
last two months of 2000 the production statistics for 2001 include a full year
of production

operating revenues

operating revenues for the year of 2002 were 2067 million a decrease of 260
million over 2001 primarily due to lower prices related to increased sales of
natural gas production to satisfy requirements under forward sales agreements

operating revenues for 2001 were 2327 million an increase of 1921 million
over 2000 primarily due to 2001 including twelve months of operations compared
to two months in 2000

operating income

operating income for 2002 was 417 million a decrease of 102 million over
2001 primarily due to lower prices related to increased sales of natural gas
production to satisfy requirements under forward sales agreements partly offset
by reduced expenses for dry hole costs and geological expenses of 178 million

operating income for 2001 was 519 million an increase of 465 million over
2000 primarily due to the inclusion of twelve months of operations for the 2001
period compared to two months in 2000

primary energy

project status primary energy is currently involved in six projects that
produce electricity steam or thermal energy on the sites of industrial
customers five projects generate energy from process streams or fuel provided
by the industrial customers the energy is then delivered to the industrial
customers under longterm contracts providing for tolling fees or processing
fees one project whiting clean energy uses natural gas to produce electricity
for sale in the wholesale markets and is expected to provide steam for
industrial use in addition a subsidiary of primary energy is a 50 partner in
a partnership that operates a coal pulverization facility two projects
ironside and north lake are owned by subsidiaries of primary energy while the
remaining facilities are owned by unaffiliated special purpose entities and
leased by primary energy subsidiaries

primary energys whiting clean energy project at bps whiting indiana refinery
incurred delays primarily associated with remediating damage that occurred
during commissioning in september 2001 the delays also resulted in an increase
in estimated project costs in addition the facility is not able at this time
to deliver steam to bp to the extent originally contemplated without plant
modifications whiting clean energy is seeking recovery of damages from the
engineering procurement and construction contractor and the insurance provider
for the delays and necessary plant modifications the engineering procurement
and construction contractor has asserted that it fully performed under its
contract and is demanding payment of the full contract price plus additional
amounts for remediation whiting clean energy and the contractor were engaged in
a dispute resolution process as prescribed under their contract relating to
these claims however on december 31 2002 the contractor filed a complaint with
the court to have the claim adjudicated in that court rather than the
arbitration process prescribed by contract the complaint also seeks to force
foreclosure on the facility if the mechanics liens remain unsatisfied primary
energy will seek to compel the issues to be arbitrated

the whiting project was placed into service in 2002 primary energy estimates
that the facility will operate at a loss in the near term based on the current
market view of forward pricing for gas and electricity for 2002 the aftertax
loss was 209 million for 2003 the aftertax loss is projected to be
approximately 276 million the profitability of the project in future periods
will be dependent on among other things prevailing prices in the energy
markets and regional load dispatch patterns

primary energys ironside project at ltvs east chicago indiana mill was
negatively impacted during 2002 by ltvs decision in december 2001 to idle the
mill on april 12 2002 ltv completed the sale of the mill to isg which
restarted operations during the second and third quarters on september 27
2002 ironside and isg entered into a letter of intent for a 15year agreement
for ironside to lease the facility to isg on september 10 2002 a subsidiary
of primary energy purchased the assets of the project for 659 million from the
special purpose entity that financed the project on october 31 2002 ironside
and isg entered into an interim agreement that provided for the operation of the
facility and payment of fees going forward full production is expected early in
2003

the lease at primary energys north lake project expired in december 2002 and a
subsidiary of primary energy purchased the project from the lessor for
approximately 380 million

national steel corp national receives electricity steam and hot water from
primary energys portside project on march 6 2002 national filed for
bankruptcy protection currently national is evaluating its options for its
agreements related to the portside project national has paid postpetition fees
due to date prepetition tolling and other fees not paid total 07 million
additionally primary energy has not received the air permit for which it filed
in 1998 although primary energy believes that issuance of the permit is
imminent it does not believe that the permit will be received prior to march
31 2003 as required in the project financing agreements absent attainment of
the air permit by the required date the debt holders could cause acceleration
of the underlying debt requiring immediate payment of the unamortized funding
which is otherwise due at the end of 2003 primary energy is currently pursuing
a waiver of the acceleration provision the unamortized funding for the portside
project is 626 million

accounting issues most of the primary energy projects were initially structured
as synthetic leases where the lessors are special purpose entities and primary
energy subsidiaries act as the lessees prior to june 30 2002 the assets and
related debt associated with these projects were not included in nisources
consolidated financial statements which treatment was approved by nisources
former independent public accountants however during the review of the second
quarter 2002 nisource determined in consultation with deloitte  touche its
independent public accountants that certain language contained in the operative
agreements for four of the projects did not support characterization of those
transactions as offbalancesheet operating leases under eitf issue no 971
implementation issues in accounting for lease transactions including those
involving special purpose entities eitf no 971 and eitf no 9710 the
effect of lessee involvement in asset construction eitf no 9710 certain
provisions in the operative documents for two transactions whiting clean
energy which was placed into service in early 2002 and ironside which was
placed into service january 1 2002 which were subject to eitf no 9710
could be interpreted to transfer substantial construction period risks to the
lessee resulting in the lessee being deemed the owner of the projects certain
provisions in the other two leases cokenergy and portside could be interpreted
to require the inclusion of certain defaultrelated obligations in minimum lease
payments resulting in the characterization of those leases as capital leases

as a result of this determination nisource changed the characterization of the
leases associated with the four projects from synthetic leases to two owned
assets and two capital leases for financial reporting purposes subsequently
during the third quarter a subsidiary of primary energy purchased the assets
related to ironside and during the fourth quarter a subsidiary of primary
energy purchased the assets of another primary energy project northlake due
to the change in the lease characterization and purchase of the ironside and
north lake project assets primary energy has recognized approximately 5930
million of assets and a corresponding amount of related debt on its balance
sheet at december 31 2002 the impact on the results of operations for prior
periods due to the revised characterization was immaterial the recognition of
the debt did not alter nisources compliance with its debt covenants and is
consistent with the treatment of such leases by the rating agencies in the
analysis of nisources credit ratings

for the single leased project not affected by eitf no 971 and eitf no 9710
nisource has not included the assets or related debt associated with the
facilities in its consolidated financial statements however due to the
issuance of fasb interpretation no 46 consolidation of variable interest
entities if the leasing structure remains unchanged nisource will reflect the
assets and related liabilities of this project in its consolidated financial
statements through consolidation of the related special purpose entity beginning
in the third quarter of 2003 the aggregate unamortized funding for the project
at december 31 2002 was 413 million

lease information primary energy continues to lease four of the projects three
of which are recognized on the consolidated balance sheets as capital leases or
assets owned in substance nisource through capital markets has guaranteed or
in substance guaranteed most lease payments to the lessors including regular
lease payments accelerated lease payments on an event of default and payment
obligations including residual guarantee amounts at the end of lease terms in
the case of an event of default a lessor can accelerate the full unamortized
amount of the lessors funding the aggregate unamortized funding for all of the
leased projects at december 31 2002 was 5575 million

at the end of an initial lease term the lessee has the right to purchase the
facility for the unamortized amount of the lessors funding if the lessee
cannot satisfy return conditions the lessee is required to purchase the
facility at such price if the lessee determines not to purchase the facility
and the lessee can satisfy the return conditions the lessee may be responsible
for a residual guarantee amount since the energy contracts with the industrial
customers are longterm and typically extend past the initial lease term the
lessee may refinance the property and negotiate to extend the lease term

the present value of a lessees aggregate liability for lease payments and
residual guarantees is generally limited to an amount equal to less than 90 of
the amount advanced the following table shows by year future minimum rental
payments including maximum residual guarantee amounts and additional amounts
due if the lessees were to purchase all of the facilities at the end of the

the ultimate liability in connection with these sites will depend upon many
factors including the extent of environmental response actions required other
prps and their financial viability and indemnification from previous facility
owners only those corrective action costs currently known and determinable can
be considered probable and reasonably estimable under sfas no 5 and
consistent with sop no 961 as costs become probable and reasonably estimable
reserves will be adjusted as appropriate nisource believes that any
environmental response actions required at former operations for which it is
ultimately liable after consideration of insurance coverage and contributions
from other prps will not have a material adverse effect on nisources financial
position

net operating revenues

net operating revenues of 791 million for 2002 decreased by 476 million from
2001 the decrease in net revenues primarily resulted from nisources decision
to scale back its gas trading business the change in value of nisources gas
and power marketing portfolios and the sale of smp

net operating revenues of 1267 million for 2001 decreased by 725 million
from 2000 this decrease is due to the sale of noncore businesses a
marktomarket loss on january east coast trades and limited trading
opportunities partially offset by higher revenues in the line locating business

operating income loss

the other segment reported an operating loss of 343 million an improvement of
195 million compared to the 2001 period the improvement was primarily
attributable to reduced losses related to nisources other noncore
subsidiaries a 155 million litigation settlement related to mhp affecting the
2001 period a 114 million reduction in reserves for estimated sales taxes of
a subsidiary previously engaged in the gas marketing business consolidation of
facilities of 113 million resulting from reorganization initiatives and a 31
million gain on the sale of contracts associated with scaling back the energy
trading operations the improvements were partly offset by an increase of 206
million in depreciation and operating expenses associated with two recently
completed cogeneration projects and a decrease of 129 million in the value of
the power trading portfolio mainly from declines in prices and reduced
volatility

the other segment reported an operating loss of 538 million in 2001 versus
operating income of 804 million in 2000 reflecting the settlement of
litigation related to mhp the impact of winding down noncore businesses a
marktomarket loss on january east coast trades limited trading opportunities
and a fourth quarter 2001 charge of 160 million related to the enron

competition and changes in the regulatory environment

the regulatory frameworks applicable to nisources operations at both the state
and federal levels are undergoing fundamental changes these changes have had
and will continue to have an impact nisources operations structure and
profitability at the same time competition within the gas and electric
industries will create opportunities to compete for new customers and revenues
management continually seeks new ways to be more competitive and profitable in
this changing environment including partnering on energy projects with major
industrial customers converting some of its generating units to allow use of
lower cost low sulfur coal providing its gas customers with increased customer
choice for new products and services acquiring companies that will provide
improved economies of scale and efficiencies and developing new energyrelated
products for residential commercial and industrial customers

natural gas competition open access to natural gas supplies over interstate
pipelines and the deregulation of the commodity price of gas has led to
tremendous change in the energy markets which continue to evolve during the
past few years ldc customers and marketers began to purchase gas directly from
producers and marketers and an open competitive market for gas supplies emerged
this separation or unbundling of the transportation and other services offered
by pipelines and ldcs allows customers to select the service they want
independent from the purchase of the commodity nisources gas distribution
subsidiaries are involved in programs that provide residential customers the
opportunity to purchase their natural gas requirements from third parties and
use the nisource gas distribution subsidiaries for transportation services only

electric competition in 1996 the federal energy regulatory commission ferc
ordered that all public utilities owning controlling or operating electric
transmission lines file nondiscriminatory openaccess tariffs and offer
wholesale electricity suppliers and marketers the same transmission service they
provide to themselves in 1997 ferc accepted for filing northern indianas
openaccess transmission tariff in december 1999 ferc issued order 2000 a
final rule addressing the formation and operation of regional transmission
organizations rtos see item 7 electric operations  regulatory matters
the rule was intended to eliminate pricing inequities in the provision of
wholesale transmission service nisource does not believe that compliance with
the new rules will be material to its future earnings although wholesale
customers currently represent a small portion of northern indianas electricity
sales it intends to continue its efforts to retain and add wholesale customers
by offering competitive rates and also intends to expand the customer base for
which it provides transmission services

nisources other operations also experience competition for energy sales and
related services from third party providers nisource meets these challenges
through innovative programs aimed at providing energy products and services at
competitive prices while also providing new services that are responsive to the
evolving energy market and customer requirements see competition in item 7 for

    against columbia columbia natural resources inc and columbia
    transmission the complaint alleges that kershaw owns an interest in an oil
    and gas lease in new york and that the defendants have underpaid royalties
    on those leases by among other things failing to base royalties on the
    price at which natural gas is sold to the end user and by improperly
    deducting postproduction costs the complaint also seeks class action
    status on behalf of all royalty owners in oil and gas leases operated by
    columbia resources plaintiff seeks the alleged royalty underpayments and
    punitive damages columbia resources and columbia transmission removed the
    case to federal court in march 2000 the federal court has now remanded

taking into account income from continuing operations results from discontinued
operations and a change in accounting nisource reported 2001 net income of
2162 million or 105 per share 2000 net income of 1509 million or 112
per share and 1604 million or 129 per share for 1999

the results for 2001 and 2000 are not comparable due to the acquisition of
columbia that was completed on november 1 2000 the current year includes a
full twelve months of columbia operations while 2000 included november and
december only in addition earnings per share are not comparable because of the
issuance of additional nisource shares in connection with the columbia
acquisition the positive impact of the addition of two million columbia gas
customers as well as the addition of new business segments gas transmission and
storage and exploration and production was reduced by record setting warm
weather a continuing economic downturn in the industrial and manufacturing
sectors and a reduced level of trading opportunities for the merchant segment

the results for 2000 and 1999 are not directly comparable due to the columbia
acquisition completed on november 1 2000 the positive impact of columbias net
income for november and december of 2000 was increased by improved results from
energyusa inc higher weatherrelated natural gas deliveries and electric
sales in december 2000 and summer 2000 and a 238 million aftertax gain on the
sale of nisources interests in market hub partners lp mhp in september
2000 results were negatively impacted by approximately 674 million of costs
in 2000 and 81 million in 1999 related to the columbia acquisition and 632
million of expense in 2000 and 183 million for 1999 for the writedown of
certain assets in 1999 a favorable adjustment of 83 million aftertax was
recorded for an insurance settlement associated with cleanup activities for
certain manufactured gas plant sites additional expense was also incurred in
2000 related to restructuring activities and the amortization of goodwill and
higher interest and facility fees on borrowings

in november 2001 nisource iwcr and the city of indianapolis city signed a
definitive agreement for the city to buy the assets of iwc and other assets of
iwcr and its subsidiaries for 5150 million which includes 1324 million in
iwcr debt and the redemption of 25 million of iwc preferred stock nisource
will retain 800 million in iwc debt it is anticipated that the transaction
will be completed in the second quarter of 2002 consequently these operations
are reflected in discontinued operations these discontinued operations resulted
in aftertax income of 01 million for 2001 98 million for 2000 and 65
million in 1999

net revenues

total consolidated net revenues gross revenues less cost of sales for the
twelve months ended december 31 2001 were 34034 million a 14554 million
increase over 2000 the increase primarily attributable to twelve months of
columbia operations in 2001 compared to two months in 2000 was reduced by
approximately 630 million by record setting warmer than normal weather

net revenues for 2000 of 1948 million increased 5553 million over 1999 due
in part to 4331 million from the inclusion of columbias operations for the
last two months of 2000 and an increase of 414 million for the full year
effect of bay state bay state was acquired in february 1999 also contributing
to the increase were improved margins on electric and wholesale natural gas
sales gas and power trading activities and increased sales to commercial and
industrial customers

expenses

operating expenses were 23945 million in 2001 a 10039 million increase
over 2000 the increase was primarily attributable to including twelve months of
columbia operations in 2001 compared to two months in 2000 in addition the
current year was negatively impacted by restructuring costs of 287 million
uncollectibles of 178 million related to the enron bankruptcy an increase in
uncollectible customer accounts of 131 million and a one time charge of 155
million related to the settlement of the mhp litigation other transition and
onetime events increased operating expenses 217 million depreciation
depletion and amortization expense in 2001 included goodwill amortization of
931 million for twelve months attributable to the columbia acquisition
compared to 150 million for two months in 2000

operating expenses of 13906 million for 2000 increased 4358 million over
1999 operation and maintenance expense was 2459 million higher due primarily
to the inclusion of columbias results for november and december 2000 and the
full year effect of bay state higher expense in 2000 compared to 1999 was also
attributable to costs related to restructuring activities that were implemented
in 2000 to improve efficiencies and higher employee related costs in addition
658 million of expense was recorded in 2000 to reflect losses on the sale of
certain assets in 1999 expense was reduced 13 million due to a favorable
insurance adjustment related to manufactured gas plant site cleanup costs
depreciation amortization and depletion expense increased 811 million
reflecting columbias operations for the last two months of 2000 the
amortization of goodwill associated with the columbia acquisition and the full
year effect of bay state as well as additional plant in service taxes other
than income were 1561 million higher also primarily due to the inclusion of
columbia for the last two months of 2000 and the full year effect of bay state

other income deductions in 2001 reduced income 6136 million compared to a
reduction in 2000 of 2904 million interest expense net increased 2932

nisources interests in mhp in september 2000 in 1999 a 165 million
nonrecurring charge was recorded associated with the carrying value of oil and
gas properties and a loss that resulted from a decision to abandon certain
businesses and facilities that were not consistent with nisources strategic
direction

income taxes

income taxes increased 573 million in 2001 over 2000 and increased 437
million in 2000 over 1999 primarily as a result of changes in pretax income and
timing differences for certain deferred tax issues the effective income tax
rate was 463 472 and 348 in 2001 2000 and 1999 respectively see note 9
of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information

discontinued operations

discontinued operations reflected aftertax gain of 01 million or less than
one cent per share in 2001 compared to aftertax income of 98 million or
007 per share in 2000 and 65 million or 005 per share in 1999 income
on discontinued operations reflects results for nisources water operations

                         liquidity and capital resources

generally cash flow from operations has provided sufficient liquidity to meet
current operating requirements a significant portion of nisources operations
most notably in the gas and electric distribution businesses are subject to
seasonal fluctuations in cash flow during the heating season which is
primarily from november through march cash receipts from gas sales and
transportation services typically exceed cash requirements in the summer
months cash receipts for electric sales normally exceed requirements also
during the summer months cash on hand together with external shortterm and
longterm financing is used in operations to purchase gas to place in storage
for heating season deliveries perform necessary maintenance of facilities make
capital improvements in plant and expand service into new areas

credit facilities

on november 1 2000 nisource completed the acquisition of columbia for
approximately 6 billion plus the assumption of approximately 2 billion of
columbia debt the acquisition was accomplished through the creation of a new
holding company to complete the acquisition of columbia nisource through
nisource finance arranged a 6 billion 364day acquisition facility with a
syndicate of banks on november 1 2000 the closing date of the acquisition
the facility supported 41 billion of commercial paper issued to finance the
columbia acquisition subsequent to the november 1 2000 columbia acquisition
nisource reduced its acquisition related commercial paper borrowings through the
issuance of 25 billion of privately placed notes completed on november 10
2000 this issuance included 750 million of threeyear notes paying a 75
coupon and maturing on november 15 2003 750 million of fiveyear notes paying
a 7625 coupon and maturing on november 15 2005 and 1 billion of tenyear
notes paying a 7875 coupon and maturing on november 15 2010 subsequently an
additional 150 million of fiveyear notes were issued bearing a 7625 coupon
and maturing on november 15 2005 on november 27 2000 nisource issued
11500000 new shares of nisource common stock at an offering price of 2525
per share the 2809 million of net proceeds were used to repay commercial
paper

during march 2001 nisource arranged 25 billion in revolving credit facilities
with a syndicate of banks to support its future working capital requirements
providing backstop support for nisources commercial paper program the new
facility consolidated essentially all of nisources existing shortterm credit
facilities into one credit facility the 25 billion credit facility consists
of a 125 billion 364day facility that terminates on march 22 2002 and a
125 billion facility that terminates on march 23 2004 on april 6 2001
nisource finance issued 3000 million of unsecured twoyear notes guaranteed by
nisource paying a 575 coupon and maturing on april 15 2003 the proceeds
were used to repay commercial paper

as a means of further improving the balance sheet nisource intends to improve
liquidity through proceeds obtained from the divestiture of the indianapolis
water company and smp the issuance of additional notes and the sale of equity
subsequent to the resolution of its pending rate investigation with the indiana
utility regulatory commission additionally nisource is currently evaluating
the appropriate dollar commitment level if any to be renewed under the 364day
facility on march 22 2002 nisource has begun preparation for the facility
renewal and syndication process

consolidated financial statements for more information

credit ratings

on december 6 2001 fitch ratings downgraded the longterm debt ratings of
nisource inc and its subsidiaries fitch cited weak consolidated credit coverage
ratios and higher than projected debt levels at nisource resulting in a credit
profile which was more consistent with a bbb rating category rather than the
previous bbb rating at the same time fitch also assigned a stable ratings
outlook for nisource and its subsidiaries on february 5 2002 fitch reaffirmed
the credit ratings of nisource inc and its subsidiaries but revised the
companys ratings outlook from stable to negative in january 2002 standard
and poors affirmed nisources bbb credit rating and its a2 commercial paper
rating with a negative outlook on december 7 2001 moodys investors service
put under review for possible downgrade the shortterm and longterm debt
ratings of nisource inc and its subsidiaries moodys stated rationale for
their negative ratings watch action was nisources higher than expected overall
leverage level and concerns about the effect that the weakening local economy
might have on the companys operating results immediately following the moodys
ratings watch action the companys ability to rollover maturities within the
a2p2 commercial paper market was significantly constrained as a result the
company utilized its revolving credit facility to fund a number of commercial
paper maturities occurring subsequent to the moodys ratings watch action at
december 31 2001 8500 million of commercial paper maturities had been
refinanced through nisources revolving credit facility on february 1 2001
moodys downgraded the senior unsecured longterm debt ratings of nisource and
nisource finance to baa3 and the commercial paper rating of nisource finance to
p3 in addition moodys downgraded the longterm debt ratings of all other
rated subsidiaries to baa2 to align the ratings of the subsidiaries and bring
them closer to the parents ratings going forward as a splitrated a2p3
commercial paper issuer the company expects that its access to the commercial
paper market will be significantly constrained and will meet its liquidity needs
going forward by using its revolving credit facility and also termingout a
portion of its shortterm borrowing requirements in the fixedincome capital
markets moodys also revised the companys outlook from stable to negative

nisource has entered into gas and electric trading agreements that contain
ratings triggers that require increased collateral if the credit ratings of
the company or certain of its subsidiaries fall below bbb at standard and
poors or baa3 at moodys the collateral requirement from a downgrade below the
ratings trigger levels would amount to approximately 500 million to 600
million in addition to agreements with ratings triggers there are other
agreements that contain adequate assurance or material adverse change
provisions the collateral requirement for those agreements would amount to
approximately 1100 million to 1150 million

in the case of nisources primary energy subsidiaries ratings triggers would
result in increases in the financing rates used to calculate operating lease
payments for four of the projects one other primary energy project would
require the issuance of a letter of credit in the event of a ratings downgrade
below ba1 by moodys or bb by standard and poors the letter of credit
required in the event of a downgrade would have a face amount of 17 million to
35 million depending on the extent of the downgrade

columbia is the principal for surety bonds issued to guarantee performance under
forward gas sales agreements the surety bonds related to forward gas sales
under agreements with mahonia ii limited have indemnity values amounting to
approximately 2940 million declining over time and have ratings triggers if
the credit rating of columbia falls below bbb at standard and poors or baa2 at
moodys columbias longterm debt ratings are currently bbb and baa2 at
standard and poors and moodys respectively the collateral requirement from a
downgrade below the ratings trigger levels would require the posting of a letter
of credit of approximately 2940 million declining over time in another but
unrelated transaction the surety in accordance with the terms of its indemnity
agreement has asked that nisource post a letter of credit in the face amount of
approximately 1310 million declining over time to support the bonds nisource
will comply with this request

for 2002 the projected capital program is expected to be 6508 million which
is 284 million lower than the 2001 level this reduced spending reflects the
continued commitment of nisource to focus on optimizing return on investments at
the core business segments the program will be funded primarily from cash from
operations as well as anticipated capital markets transactions

all estimated capital and investment expenditures for the above segments are
subject to periodic review and revision and may vary depending on a number of
factors including but not limited to industry restructuring regulatory
constraints acquisition opportunities market volatility and economic trends

enron bankruptcy filing

on december 2 2001 enron corp filed for protection from creditors under
chapter 11 of the united states bankruptcy code nisource has certain exposure
to enron as a result of hedging and trading activities and providing services
to enron at nisources gas pipeline and gas distribution subsidiaries prior to
enrons bankruptcy filing nisource had basis and commodity swaps pipeline
transportation and storage agreements physical commodity contracts for natural
gas electricity and coal and so2 trading agreements in place with enron as the
counterparty all contracts with the exception of the pipeline transportation
and storage agreements and a contract to supply gas to choice customers of the
columbia of ohio gas distribution subsidiary were terminated by nisource at the
end of november 2001 nisource recorded a pretax charge of 178 million in
2001 related to the enron bankruptcy filing

                 market risk sensitive instruments and positions

risk is an inherent part of nisources energy businesses and activities the
extent to which nisource properly and effectively identifies assesses monitors
and manages each of the various types of risk involved in its businesses is
critical to its profitability nisource seeks to identify assess monitor and
manage in accordance with defined policies and procedures the following
principal risks involved in nisources energy businesses commodity market risk
interest rate risk and credit risk risk management at nisource is a
multifaceted process with independent oversight that requires constant
communication judgment and knowledge of specialized products and markets
nisources senior management takes an active role in the risk management process
and has developed policies and procedures that require specific administrative
and business functions to assist in the identification assessment and control
of various risks in recognition of the increasingly varied and complex nature
of the energy business nisources risk management policies and procedures
continue to evolve and are subject to ongoing review and modification

through its various business activities nisource is exposed to risk including
nontrading and trading risks the nontrading risks to which nisource is
exposed include interest rate risk commodity price risk and credit risk of its
subsidiaries the risk resulting from trading activities consists primarily of
commodity price and credit risks nisources risk management policy permits the
use of certain financial instruments to manage its market risk including
futures forwards options and swaps

risk management at nisource is defined as the process by which the organization
ensures that the risks to which it is exposed are the risks to which it desires
to be exposed to achieve its primary business objectives nisource employs
various analytic techniques to measure and monitor its market and credit risks
including valueatrisk var and instrument sensitivity to market factors var
represents the potential loss or gain for an instrument or portfolio from
adverse changes in market factors for a specified time period and at a
specified confidence level

nontrading risks

commodity price risk resulting from nontrading activities at nisources
rateregulated subsidiaries is limited since current regulations allow recovery
of prudently incurred purchased power fuel and gas costs through the
ratemaking process as the utility industry undergoes deregulation these
operations may be providing services without the benefit of the traditional
ratemaking process and will be more exposed to commodity price risk nisource
enters into certain sales contracts with customers based upon a fixed sales
price and varying volumes which are ultimately dependent upon the customers
supply requirements nisource utilizes derivative financial instruments to
reduce the commodity price risk based on modeling techniques to anticipate these
future supply requirements

nisources exploration and production segment is also exposed to market risk due
primarily to fluctuations in commodity prices in order to help minimize this
risk nisource has adopted a policy that requires commodityhedging activities
to help ensure stable cash flow favorable prices and margins

nisource is exposed to interest rate risk as a result of changes in interest
rates on borrowings under revolving credit agreements and lines of credit which
have interest rates that are indexed to shortterm market interest rates and
refinancing risk in the commercial paper markets at december 31 2001 and
december 31 2000 the combined borrowings outstanding under these facilities
totaled 18543 million and 24967 million respectively based upon average
borrowings under these agreements during 2001 and 2000 an increase in
shortterm interest rates of 100 basis points 1 would have increased interest
expense by 194 million and 157 million for the year ended 2001 and 2000
respectively nisource is also exposed to interest rate risk under a synthetic
lease agreement related to its primary energy subsidiary a portion of the
synthetic lease payment floats with a referenced interest rate thus exposing
primary energy to interest rate risks primary energy engages in interest rate
swaps to fix the floating payment and designates these instruments as cash flow
hedges the swaps are entered into to effectively hedge the cash flow risk of
the anticipated lease payments

due to the nature of the industry credit risk is a factor in many of nisources
business activities in sales and trading activities credit risk arises because
of the possibility that counterparty will not be able or willing to fulfill its
obligations on a transaction on or before settlement date in derivative
activities credit risk arises when counterparties to derivative contracts
such as interest rate swaps are obligated to pay nisource the positive fair
value or receivable resulting from the execution of contract terms exposure to
credit risk is measured in terms of both current and potential exposure current
credit exposure is generally measured by the notional or principal value of
financial instruments and direct credit substitutes such as commitments and
standby letters of credit and guarantees current credit exposure includes the
positive fair value of derivative instruments because many of nisources
exposures vary with changes in market prices nisource also estimates the
potential credit exposure over the remaining term of transactions through
statistical analyses of market prices in determining exposure nisource
considers collateral and master netting agreements which are used to reduce
individual counterparty credit risk

trading risks

the transactions associated with nisources energy trading operations give rise
to various risks including market risks resulting from the potential loss from
adverse changes in the market prices of natural gas or electricity the gas and
power trading operations market and trade overthecounter contracts for the
purchase and sale of natural gas and electricity and also trade natural gas
products on the nymex the gas marketing and trading activities consists of both
physical and trading activities the power trading activities generally do not
result in the physical delivery of electricity some contracts within the
trading portfolio may require settlement by physical delivery but are net
settled in accordance with industry standards

nisource employs a var model to assess the market risk of its energy trading
portfolios market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or
more market prices rates indices volatilities correlations or other market
factors such as liquidity will result in losses for a specified position or
portfolio nisource estimates the oneday var across all trading groups that
utilize derivatives using either monte carlo simulation or variancecovariance
at a 95 confidence level based on the results of the var analysis the daily
market exposure for power trading on an average high and low basis was 11
million 37 million and effectively zero respectively at december 31 2001
the daily var for the gas trading portfolio on an average high and low basis
was 09 million 47 million and 02 million at december 31 2001
respectively

accounting change

effective january 1 2001 nisource adopted the financial accounting standards
boards fasb statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 133
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities as subsequently
amended by sfas no 137 and sfas no 138 collectively referred to as sfas no
133 these statements establish accounting and reporting standards for
derivative instruments including certain derivative instruments embedded in
other contracts collectively referred to as derivatives and for hedging
activities sfas no 133 requires an entity to recognize all derivatives as
either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and measure those instruments
at fair value if certain conditions are met a derivative may be specifically
designated as a a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of a
recognized asset or liability or an unrecognized firm commitment b a hedge of
the exposure to variable cash flows of a forecasted transaction or c a hedge
of the foreign currency exposure of a net investment in a
foreigncurrencydenominated forecasted transaction the accounting for changes
in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative
and resulting designation

the adoption of this statement on january 1 2001 resulted in a cumulative
aftertax increase to net income of approximately 4 million and an aftertax
reduction to other comprehensive income oci of approximately 17 million the
adoption also resulted in the recognition of 178 million of assets and 2128
million of liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet additionally the
adoption resulted in the reduction of hedged risk basis of 38 million and the
reclassification of deferred revenue to oci of 179 million approximately 74
million of the net losses included in the cumulative effect of a change in
accounting principle component of oci were reclassified into earnings during
2001

critical accounting policies

nisource has adopted certain accounting policies based on the accounting
requirements discussed below that have had and may continue to have
significant impacts on nisources results of operations and consolidated balance
sheets

sfas no 71  accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation
statement of financial accounting standards no 71 accounting for the effects
of certain types of regulation sfas no 71 provides that rateregulated
subsidiaries account for and report assets and liabilities consistent with the
economic effect of the way in which regulators establish rates if the rates
established are designed to recover the costs of providing the regulated service
and if the competitive environment makes it probable that such rates can be
charged and collected nisources rateregulated subsidiaries follow the
accounting and reporting requirements of sfas no 71 certain expenses and
credits subject to utility regulation or rate determination normally reflected
in income are deferred on the balance sheet and are recognized in income as the
related amounts are included in service rates and recovered from or refunded to
customers the total amounts of regulatory assets and liabilities reflected on
the consolidated balance sheets were 7513 million and 827 million at
december 31 2001 and 9706 million and 221 million at december 31 2000
respectively

in the event that regulation significantly changes the opportunity for nisource
to recover its costs in the future all or a portion of nisources regulated
operations may no longer meet the criteria for the application of sfas no 71
in such event a writedown of all or a portion of nisources existing
regulatory assets and liabilities could result if transition cost recovery is
approved by the appropriate regulatory bodies that would meet the requirements
under generally accepted accounting principles for continued accounting as
regulatory assets and liabilities during such recovery period the regulatory
assets and liabilities would be reported at the recoverable amounts if nisource
would not be able to continue to apply the provisions of sfas no 71 nisource
would have to apply the provisions of sfas no 101 regulated enterprises 
accounting for the discontinuation of application of fasb statement no 71 in
managements opinion nisources regulated subsidiaries will be subject to sfas
no 71 for the foreseeable future

certain of the regulatory assets reflected on nisources consolidated balance
sheets require specific regulatory action in order to be included in future
service rates although recovery of these amounts is not guaranteed nisource
believes that these costs meet the requirements for deferral as regulatory
assets under sfas no 71 regulatory assets requiring specific regulatory action
amounted to 2784 million and 1966 million at december 31 2001 and 2000
respectively

sfas no 133  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities
sfas no 133 establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative
instruments including certain derivative instruments embedded in other
contracts collectively referred to as derivatives and for hedging activities
sfas no 133 requires an entity to recognize all derivatives as either assets or
liabilities on the balance sheet and measure those instruments at fair value if
certain conditions are met a derivative may be specifically designated as a a
hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognized asset or
liability or an unrecognized firm commitment b a hedge of the exposure to
variable cash flows of a forecasted transaction or c a hedge of the foreign
currency exposure of a net investment in a foreigncurrencydenominated
forecasted transaction the accounting for changes in the fair value of a
derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and resulting
designation

unrealized and realized gains and losses are recognized each period as
components of other comprehensive income regulatory assets and liabilities or
earnings depending on the nature of such derivatives for subsidiaries that
utilize derivatives for cash flow hedges the effective portions of the gains
and losses are recorded to other comprehensive income and are recognized in
earnings concurrent with the disposition of the hedged risks for fair value
hedges the gains and losses are recorded in earnings each period along with the
change in the fair value of the hedged item for hedges of foreign currency the
accounting treatment generally follows the treatment for cash flow hedges or
fair value hedges depending on the nature of the foreign currency hedge as a
result of the ratemaking process the rateregulated subsidiaries generally
record gains and losses as regulatory liabilities or assets and recognize such
gains or losses in earnings when recovered in revenues

in order for a derivative contract to be designated as a hedge the relationship
between the hedging instrument and the hedged item or transaction must be highly
effective the effectiveness test is performed at the inception of the hedge and
each reporting period thereafter throughout the period that the hedge is
designated any amounts determined to be ineffective are recorded currently in
earnings

although nisource applies some judgment in the assessment of hedge effectiveness
to designate certain derivatives as hedges the nature of the contracts used to
hedge the underlying risks is such that the correlation of the changes in fair
values of the derivatives and underlying risks is generally high nisource
generally uses nymex exchangetraded natural gas futures and options contracts
and overthecounter swaps based on published indices to hedge the risks
underlying its natural gasrelated businesses nisource had 660 million of
price risk management assets and 103 million of price risk management
liabilities primarily related to cash flow hedges at december 31 2001 the
amount of unrealized gains recorded to other comprehensive income was 501
million at december 31 2001

operations in accordance with the criteria for derivative contracts under sfas
no 133 contracts not meeting the criteria under sfas no 133 are recorded at
fair value under emerging issues task force issue no 9810 accounting for
energy trading and risk management activities eitf no 9810 eitf no 9810
indicates that when certain trading criteria are met energy contracts
including energyrelated contracts such as tolling transportation and storage
contracts should be accounted for at fair value marked to market along with
any related derivative contracts the related gains and losses should be
included currently in earnings energy trading activities refers to energy
contracts entered into with the objective of generating profits on or from
exposure to shifts or changes in market prices

nisource believes that the primary business of its trading operations indicates
that the results of the trading activities should be accounted for under eitf
no 9810 pursuant to the requirements of eitf no 9810 nisource records the
results of its trading operations on a mark to market basis with realized and
unrealized gains and losses recorded currently in earnings the assessment of
fair values is mainly based on pricing information on exchangetraded contracts
nisource does not recognize significant amounts of income or loss at the
origination of its trading deals

at december 31 2001 and 2000 nisource reflected 2523 million and 15911
million of price risk management assets and 2434 million and 15686 million
of price risk management liabilities related to unrealized gains and losses on
trading activities respectively trading revenues net of cost of sales were

emerging issues task force issue no 9710  the effect of lessee involvement in
asset construction emerging issues task force issue no 9710 the effect of
lessee involvement in asset construction eitf no 9710 provides the
accounting requirements for situations in which an entity lessee is involved
on behalf of an owner lessor with the construction of an asset that will be
leased to the lessee when construction of the asset is completed various forms
of the lessees involvement during the construction period may indicate that the
lessee is in substance the owner of the asset for financial reporting
purposes generally the lessee is considered the owner of the asset if the
lessee has substantially all of the construction period risks if the lessee is
considered the owner of the asset during the construction period a sale and
leaseback of the asset occurs when construction of the asset is complete and the
lease term begins

in these synthetic lease situations the ownerlessor is generally a special
purpose entity pursuant to emerging issues task force issue no 9015 impact
of nonsubstantive lessors residual value guarantees and other provisions in
leasing transactions eitf no 9015 these special purpose  entities are not
consolidated by the lessee when parties unrelated to the lessee have made
substantive residual equity capital investments in the amount of at least three
percent of the entities capitalization if the three percent test is met the
constructed asset and related debt if any are not included in the lessees
consolidated financial statements

primary energy has projects that are accounted for under eitf no 9710 and eitf
no 9015 the aggregate unamortized funding for all the projects at december
31 2001 was 6297 million nisource does not consolidate the assets or related
debt in its consolidated financial statements

competition

the regulatory environment applicable to nisources subsidiaries continues to
undergo fundamental changes these changes have previously had and will
continue to have an impact on nisources operations structure and
profitability at the same time competition within the energy industry will
create opportunities to compete for new customers and revenues management has
taken steps to become more competitive and profitable in this changing
environment these initiatives include partnering on energy projects with major
industrial customers providing its customers with increased choice for new
products and services acquiring companies that increase nisources scale of
operations and establishing subsidiaries that develop new energyrelated
products for residential commercial and industrial customers including the

the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks that occurred on the world trade center
in new york city and the pentagon in washington dc has had pervasive negative
impacts on several us industries and on the us economy in general while
nisource was not directly impacted by the event the company believes that it
has been impacted indirectly since the incident nisource has noted evidence of
substantial rate increases and additional coverage restrictions in the energy
insurance market the company expects the cost of its insurance and related
deductibles to be higher than they were previously when much of its insurance
is renewed in july 2002 other indirect impacts of the september 11 incident
include lower revenues due to the negative impact on certain of nisources
industrial customers and higher costs related to items such as travel and
security

presentation of segment information

as a result of the november 1 2000 acquisition of columbia nisource revised
its presentation of primary business segment information columbias gas
transmission and storage and exploration and production businesses are now
reported as business segments of nisource columbias gas distribution
operations have been combined with nisources gas distribution business

during 2001 nisource realigned a portion of its operations and reclassified
previously reported operating segment information to conform to the realigned
operating structure the realignment affected three previously reported
segments and included moving all ongoing operations of energy marketing and
certain operations from the electric operations and other segments to the newly
created merchant operations segment the electric wheeling bulk power and
power trading operations were moved from the electric operations segment to
merchant operations and the companys primary energy subsidiary which develops
onsite industrialbased energy solutions was moved from other to merchant
operations all periods presented reflect these changes the business segment
information should be read taking into account the critical accounting policies
adopted by nisource and discussed in other information of this item 7

competition

gas distribution competes with investorowned municipal and cooperative
electric utilities throughout its service area and to a lesser extent with
propane and fuel oil suppliers gas distribution continues to be a strong
competitor in the energy market as a result of strong customer preference for
natural gas electric competition is generally strongest in the residential and
commercial markets of kentucky southern ohio southwestern pennsylvania and
western virginia where electric rates are primarily driven by lowcost
coalfired generation gas competes with fuel oil and propane in the new england
markets

restructuring

in december 2001 nisource announced a restructuring program designed to
generate greater efficiencies in field operations customer contact centers and
administrative support staff throughout various gas distribution and electric
operations companies in october 2001 nisource executed a reorganization of
sales and marketing functions the current year results include 287 million in
expenses mainly for severance costs associated with these programs of this
total 225 million was included in the gas distribution segment operating
results with the remainder included in the electric operations segment results
the programs will result in a reduction of 500 employees in field operations
contact centers administrative support and sales and marketing functions
throughout the nisource gas distribution and electric operations segment
companies

regulatory matters

the gas industry deregulation which began in the mid1980s at the federal
level has broadened to retail customers at the state level large industrial
and commercial customers have had the ability to purchase natural gas directly
from marketers and to use gas distributions facilities for transportation
services for several years this opportunity to choose an alternative supplier
is now migrating into the small commercial and residential customer classes with
approved or pilot transportation programs being used in 8 of the 9 states as of
december 31 2001 approximately 700000 of gas distributions 32 million
customers have selected an alternate supplier

gas distribution continues to develop customer choice opportunities through
regulatory initiatives in all of its jurisdictions while these programs are
intended to provide all customer classes with the opportunity to obtain gas
supplies from alternative merchants gas distribution expects to play a
substantial role in supplying gas commodity services to its customers in the
foreseeable future as customers enroll in these programs and purchase their gas
from other suppliers the gas distribution subsidiaries are left with pipeline
capacity they have contracted for but no longer need the state commissions in
jurisdictions served by gas distribution are at various stages in addressing
these issues and other transition considerations gas distribution is currently
recovering or has the opportunity to recover the costs resulting from the
unbundling of its services and believes that most of such future costs will be
mitigated or recovered methodologies for mitigating or recovering transition
costs include incentive sharing mechanisms decontracting of pipeline capacity
and mandatory assignment of pipeline capacity to alternative suppliers

in december 1999 the public utilities commission of ohio puco approved a
request from columbia gas of ohio inc columbia of ohio that extends columbia
of ohios customer choicesm program through october 31 2004 freezes base
rates through october 31 2004 and resolves the issue of transition costs from
pipeline capacity under the agreement columbia of ohio assumes total financial
risk for mitigation of transition capacity costs at no additional cost to
customers columbia of ohio has the opportunity to utilize nontraditional
revenue sources as a means of offsetting the costs

on november 20 2001 the puco issued final rules to implement the provisions of
choice legislation enacted by the ohio general assembly on march 27 2001 the
new rules establish the process for puco certification and regulation of
competitive retail natural gas suppliers establish minimum service standards
for competitive natural gas suppliers and specify the procedures for
establishment of governmental aggregation programs in which consumers have the
right to optout of the program the new rules are expected to become
effective in mid2002 a number of parties including columbia of ohio have
requested rehearing on certain provisions of these rules the puco has granted a
rehearing

as part of the kentucky public service commission order approving the
acquisition of columbia columbia of kentucky is required to file a rate case
that includes an estimate of net merger savings and a mechanism to reflect on
customers bills merger savings

northern utilities new hampshire division filed a general rate case in
november 2001 the filing proposes an increase in revenue of 38 million or
approximately 74 of annual operating revenues on february 7 2002 the new
hampshire public utilities commission nhpuc granted an interim rate increase
of approximately 23 million actual revenues will be reconciled to permanent
rates at the conclusion of the general rate case

on august 11 1999 the indiana utility regulatory commission iurc approved a
flexible gas cost adjustment mechanism for northern indiana under the new
procedure the demand component of the adjustment factor will be determined
after hearings and iurc approval and made effective on november 1 of each year
the demand component will remain in effect for one year until a new demand
component is approved by the iurc the commodity component of the adjustment
factor will be determined by monthly filings which will become effective on the
first day of each calendar month subject to refund the monthly filings do not
require iurc approval but will be reviewed by the iurc during the annual hearing
that will take place regarding the demand component filing northern indianas
gas cost adjustment factor also includes a gas cost incentive mechanism gcim
which allows the sharing of any cost savings or cost increases with customers
based on a comparison of actual gas supply portfolio cost to a marketbased
benchmark price northern indiana made its annual filing on september 1 2001

ferc order 637

the ferc issued order 637 on february 9 2000 the order sets forth revisions to
the previous regulatory framework to improve the competitiveness and the
efficiency of the interstate natural gas transportation market it effects
changes in regulations relating to scheduling procedures pipeline penalties
more transparent pricing new pipeline service offerings capacity release
capabilities new reporting requirements and various other service related
issues intended to enhance competition in the industry

since the order was issued pipelines have made pro forma filings to comply gas
distribution has actively engaged in settlement discussions with all of its
pipeline suppliers as well as with other major customers on those pipeline
systems in an effort to resolve pertinent issues

to date only a few minor pipeline suppliers have been able to reach an
agreement with customers and file settlements which have generally been
approved by ferc the major pipeline suppliers have virtually all made revised
pro forma compliance filings which continue to be protested by the majority of
their customers those filings have been awaiting ferc action since early last
fall

based upon early orders from ferc on some pipelines compliance filings gas
distribution believes that implementation of order 637 will begin to take place
prior to the winter of 20022003 not all of the pipelines serving gas
distribution have resolved their order 637 proceedings however fercs recent
clarifications have provided some guidance regarding the effect of order 637 on
various aspects of pipeline operations gas distribution is evaluating those
effects but given the degree of compromise that occurred from all segments of
the industry management believes that full implementation of order no 637 will
not have a material effect upon gas distribution costs operations or income

environmental matters

remediation several gas distribution subsidiaries are potentially responsible
parties prps at waste disposal sites under the comprehensive environmental
response compensation and liability act cercla commonly known as superfund
and similar state laws including at former manufactured gas plant mgp sites
which such subsidiaries or their corporate predecessors own or previously
owned or operated gas distribution subsidiaries may be required to share in the
cost of clean up of such sites in addition some gas distribution subsidiaries
have corrective action liability under the resource conservation and recovery
act rcra for closure and clean up costs associated with underground storage
tanks and under the toxic substances control act tsca for clean up of
polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs released at various facilities

gas distribution subsidiaries are parties to or otherwise involved in clean up
of four waste disposal sites under superfund or similar state laws for one of
these sites the potential liability is de minimis and for the other three the
final costs of clean up have not yet been determined as site investigations and
cleanups proceed and as additional information becomes available waste
disposal site liability is reviewed periodically and adjusted

a program has been instituted to identify and investigate former mgp sites where
gas distribution subsidiaries or predecessors are the current or former owner
the investigation has identified 84 such sites initial investigation has been
conducted at 42 sites of these sites additional investigation activities have
been completed or are in progress at 34 sites and remedial measures have been
implemented or completed at 19 sites only those site investigation
characterization and remediation costs currently known and determinable can be
considered probable and reasonably estimable under statement of financial
accounting standards no 5 accounting for contingencies sfas no 5

as costs become probable and reasonably estimable reserves will be adjusted as
appropriate as reserves are recorded regulatory assets are recorded to the
extent environmental expenditures are expected to be recovered through rates
nisource is unable at this time to accurately estimate the time frame and
potential costs of the entire program management expects that as
characterization is completed additional remediation work is performed and more
facts become available nisource will be able to develop a probable and
reasonable estimate for the entire program or a major portion thereof consistent
with the securities and exchange commissions staff accounting bulletin no 92
sab no 92 which covers accounting and disclosures relating to loss
contingencies sfas no 5 and american institute of certified public
accountants statement of position 961 environmental remediation liabilities
sop no961

as of december 31 2001 a reserve of approximately 682 million has been
recorded to cover probable environmental response actions the ultimate
liability in connection with these sites will depend upon many factors
including the volume of material contributed to the site years of ownership or
operation the number of other prps and their financial viability and the extent
of environmental response actions required based upon investigations and
managements understanding of current environmental laws and regulations
nisource believes that any environmental response actions required after
consideration of insurance coverage contributions from other prps and rate
recovery will not have a material effect on its financial position

mercury program until the 1960s gas regulators containing small quantities of
mercury were installed in homes on some natural gas systems the purpose of
these regulators was to reduce the pressure of the natural gas flowing from the
service line for use inside of the home

in 2000 several gas distribution companies unaffiliated with nisource were
involved in highly publicized testing and clean up programs resulting from
mercury spills associated with the removal of gas regulators containing mercury
a number of the nisource gas distribution subsidiaries historically utilized gas
regulators that contained small quantities of mercury all nisource gas
distribution subsidiaries have implemented programs to investigate maintain
andor remove and replace gas regulators containing mercury including
procedures ensuring that any accidental mercury spills are detected and properly
cleaned up to date no material problems associated with past or current use or
removal of mercury regulators have been identified as a result nisource
believes it is unlikely that any financial exposure from this matter would have
a material effect on its financial position or results of operations of its gas
distribution subsidiaries

market conditions

the recession during 2001 contributed to lower demand reduced production and
fuel switching to coal 6 oil and distillate resulted in industrial
throughput falling 25 from its peak of over 400 bcf the steel industry which
has historically represented over twothirds of the industrial throughput in
indiana and over onethird of the industrial throughput in the major markets of
ohio pennsylvania and kentucky was particularly hard hit with a number of
companies filing for bankruptcy

in the winter of 20002001 spot prices for gas purchases exceeded 600dth
the unprecedented high prices were due primarily to tight supply and increased
demand during this period demand was higher than in previous periods due to the
continued economic expansion in 2000 proliferation of gasfired electric
generation and record cold weather during november and december 2000 lower
production coupled with increased demand resulted in lower storage levels of
natural gas for many companies during the 20002001 winter season

spot prices for the current winter period are in the low to mid200dth range
prices more in line with winter seasons in the 1990s entering this winter
storage levels were well above those of recent years as a result of the economic
downturn reduced demand for gasdriven electric power generation and increased
natural gas drilling activity given the high storage levels in place midway
through this winter the current price levels are expected to continue through
this winter season the higher prices of late 2000 and early 2001 encouraged
producers to increase natural gas drilling activities over levels experienced in
1999 by mid 2001 this resulted in the highest level of natural gas drilling
activity since the early 1980s however with the drop in prices since last
winter that trend in drilling has turned around with about 26 fewer active
rigs in december 2001 compared to the high experienced in july 2001 and about
6 fewer compared to a year ago in december 2000

all nisource gas distribution companies have stateapproved recovery mechanisms
that provide a means for full recovery of prudently incurred gas costs gas
costs are treated as passthrough costs and have no impact on the net revenues
recorded in the period the gas costs included in revenues are matched with the
gas cost expense recorded in the period and the difference is recorded on the
balance sheet to be included in a future billing mechanism to true up customer
billings

the impact of the higher gas costs on gas distribution customers bills and
bankruptcies in the steel industry were primarily responsible for the 131
million or 22 increase in uncollectible expenses recorded in 2001 in ohio
regulatory approval was given to defer 195 million of current year
uncollectible expense representing the excess of current year expense over the
amounts collected in base rates

the gas distribution companies have pursued nontraditional revenue sources
within the evolving natural gas marketplace these efforts include both the sale
of products and services upstream of its service territory the sale of products
and services in its service territories and gas supply cost incentive mechanisms
for service to its core markets the upstream products are made up of
transactions that occur between the gas distribution company and a buyer for the
sales of unbundled or rebundled gas supply and capacity products the onsystem
services are offered by the company to customers and include products such as
the transportation of gas on the gas distribution company system the incentive
mechanisms give the gas distribution companies an opportunity to share in the
savings created from such things as gas purchase prices paid below an agreed
benchmark and its ability to reduce pipeline capacity charges the treatment of
the revenues generated from these types of transactions vary by operating
company with some sharing in the benefits with customers and others using these
revenues to mitigate transition costs occurring as the result of choice programs
described above under regulatory matters gas distribution generated 422 in
net revenues from various nontraditional sales and incentive programs in 2001
a 387 million increase over the prior year

weather

weather in the gas distribution service territory was 12 warmer than normal
this negatively impacted the deliveries primarily to residential and commercial
customers by approximately 360 million dekatherms mdth versus prior year and
reduced net revenues by approximately 630 million from prior year weather in
2000 and 1999 was 18 and 8 respectively warmer than normal

throughput

total volumes sold and transported of 10075 mdth for 2001 increased 4681 mdth
from 2000 columbias five gas distribution companies contributed 5508 mdth
additional throughput this increase was partially offset by the impact of the
economic decline on the industrial demand primarily the steel industry
additionally the warmer weather reduced current period throughput by 357 mdth

throughput for 2000 of 5394 mdth increased 888 mdth from 1999 due to the
acquisition of columbia on november 1 2000

for the twelve months ended december 31 2001 operating income for gas
distribution operations was 3808 million an increase of 1398 million over
the same period in 2000 reflecting the benefit of twelve months of columbia
operations compared to two months in 2000 the increase was tempered by record
setting warmer than normal weather that reduced operating income by
approximately 630 million a 360 million increase in amortization of
goodwill associated with the acquisition of columbia and 234 million for
restructuring costs in addition higher uncollectibles increased 131 million
over the prior year primarily resulting from the higher cost of gas in the
20002001 heating period this negative variance was reduced by the impact of a
favorable order that allows regulatory treatment of customer bad debts totaling
approximately 195 million

operating income of 2410 million for 2000 increased 1270 million over 1999
reflecting two months of columbias operations and the full year effect of bay
state operations tempering these improvements was 169 million of expense in
2000 for the writedown of certain assets in preparation for sale and
approximately 69 million of expense related to the amortization of goodwill
attributable to the acquisition of columbia restructuring costs and higher
employee related costs these higher costs were partially offset by lower
customer related expenses

proposed millennium pipeline project

the proposed millennium pipeline project millennium project in which columbia
transmission is participating and will serve as developer and operator will
transport western gas supplies to northeast and midatlantic markets the
442mile pipeline will connect to canadian facilities at a new lake erie export
point and transport approximately 700000 dth per day to eastern markets in
august 2001 transcanada pipelines ltd and st clair pipelines ltd the
sponsors of the proposed upstream canadian facilities to the lake erie export
point withdrew their pending applications before canadas national energy board
for approval of the proposed facilities without prejudice to refiling at a
later date the withdrawal notice cited the delays encountered in millenniums
ferc proceedings on december 19 2001 the ferc issued a certificate approving
the construction and operation of the pipeline subject to a number of
conditions including a condition that construction may not commence until any
necessary canadian authorizations are obtained furthermore the certificate
requires that the millennium facilities be constructed within two years from the
date of the order rehearing requests were filed on january 18 2002

to date a number of shippers have signed agreements for a significant portion
of the available capacity in light of the changing market environment
millennium is in ongoing discussions with potential shippers regarding the
extent and timing their needs

the sponsors of the proposed millennium project are columbia transmission
westcoast energy inc transcanada pipe lines ltd and mcn energy group inc

sale of facilities

columbia transmission continues to evaluate and dispose of noncore assets
columbia transmission is currently negotiating with third parties on the sale of
small diameter pipelines and other facilities in kentucky ohio new york
pennsylvania and west virginia

transportation for new electric generation projects

during 2001 columbia transmission began providing up to 629000 dekatherms a
day dthd to serve five new electric generating facilities columbia
transmission has also requested permission from the ferc to construct facilities
to provide up to 260000 dthd to two electric generating facilities scheduled
to be in service in 2003

effect of ldc unbundling services

nisources gas transmission and storage subsidiaries compete with other
interstate pipelines for the transportation and storage of natural gas since
the issuance of ferc order no 636 various states throughout columbia
transmissions service area have initiated proceedings dealing with open access
and unbundling of ldc services among other things unbundling involves
providing all ldcs with the choice of what entity will serve as transporter as
well as merchant supplier while the scope and timing of these various
unbundling initiatives varies from state to state retail choice programs are
being extended to ldc customers throughout columbia transmissions market area

among the issues being addressed in the state unbundling proceedings is the
treatment of the pipeline transmission and storage agreements that have
underpinned the traditional ldc merchant function in the case of columbia
transmission and columbia gulf contracts covering the majority of their firm
transportation and storage quantities with ldcs have primary terms that extend
to october 31 2004 management fully expects that the ldcs or those entities
to which pipeline capacity may be assigned as a result of the ldc unbundling
process will continue to fulfill their obligations under these contracts
however in view of the changing market and regulatory environment nisources
gas transmission and storage companies have commenced the process of discussing
longterm transportation and storage service needs with their firm customers
those discussions could result in the restructuring of some of these contracts
on mutually agreeable terms prior to 2004

environmental matters

columbia transmission continues to conduct characterization and remediation
activities at specific sites under a 1995 epa administrative order by consent
aoc the program pursuant to the aoc covers approximately 240 facilities
approximately 13000 liquid removal points approximately 2200 mercury
measurement stations and about 3700 storage well locations as of december 31
2001 field characterization has been performed at all sites site
characterization reports and remediation plans which must be submitted to the
epa for approval are in various stages of development and completion
remediation has been completed at the mercury measurement stations liquid
removal point sites and storage well locations and at a number of the 240
facilities

only those site investigation characterization and remediation costs currently
known and determinable can be considered probable and reasonably estimable
under sfas no 5 as costs become probable and reasonably estimable reserves
will be adjusted as appropriate columbia transmission is unable at this time
to accurately estimate the time frame and potential costs of the entire program
management expects that as characterization reports and remediation plans are
completed and approved by the epa and additional remediation work is performed
columbia transmission should be able to develop a probable and reasonable
estimate for the entire program consistent with sab no 92 sfas no 5 and sop
no 961

columbia transmission and columbia gulf are prps at several waste disposal
sites the potential liability is believed to be de minimis however the final
allocation of cleanup costs has yet to be determined as site investigations
and cleanups proceed and as additional information becomes available waste
disposal site liability is reviewed periodically and adjusted

at the end of 2001 the remaining environmental liability recorded on the
balance sheet for gas transmission and storage operations was  905 million
columbia transmissions environmental cash expenditures are expected to be
approximately  125 million in 2002 these expenditures will be charged against
the previously recorded liability a regulatory asset has been recorded to the
extent environmental expenditures are expected to be recovered through

lost and unaccounted for gas

on march 1 2001 columbia transmission made its annual retainage adjustment
mechanism ram filing with the ferc to revise the retainage percentages
applicable to its tariff services to be effective april 2 2001 based on actual
activity for the calendar year 2000 and projected activity over the 12month
period commencing april 1 on march 28 2001 the ferc accepted and suspended
the filing subject to refund and further review and noted the increase in the
actual level of lost and unaccountedfor gas during 2000 on april 30 2001 in
response to the march 28 2001 order columbia transmission submitted responses
to certain questions asked by the ferc with respect to the companys march 1
filing in its responses columbia transmission agreed to review certain factors
that may have contributed to the increase in lost and unaccountedfor gas for
calendar year 2000 and to file a report setting forth steps that may be taken
to mitigate future losses

columbia transmission filed a report with the ferc on october 31 2001 setting
forth its analysis of items that may have contributed to the increase in lost
and unaccountedfor gas on the same date columbia transmission made a
supplemental filing with the ferc to decrease the transportation retainage
percentage level established in the march 1 filing on december 19 2001 the
ferc issued an order accepting the companys april 30 and october 31 filings
the order requires the company to answer certain questions in its next annual
filing on march 1 2002 request for rehearing of the fercs december 19 order
have been filed it is the opinion of management that the outcome of this matter
is not expected to have a material effect on nisources financial position

storage base gas sales

columbia transmission sold 54 mdth of base gas volumes during 2001 resulting
in a pretax gain of 114 million base gas represents storage volumes that are
maintained to ensure that adequate pressure exists to deliver current inventory
as a result of ongoing improvements made in its storage operations columbia
transmission determined that a portion of these storage volumes were no longer
necessary to maintain deliverability of current inventory

capital expenditure program

the gas transmission and storage segments net capital expenditure program was
1374 million in 2001 and is projected to be approximately 1323 million in
2002 new business initiatives totaled approximately 517 million in 2001 and
are expected to be 583 million in 2002 the remaining expenditures are for
modernizing and upgrading facilities

throughput

columbia transmissions throughput consists of transportation and storage
services for ldcs and other customers within its market area which covers
portions of northeastern midatlantic midwestern and southern states and the
district of columbia throughput for columbia gulf reflects mainline
transportation services from rayne louisiana to leach kentucky and shorthaul
transportation services from the gulf of mexico to rayne louisiana crossroads
serves customers in northern indiana and ohio and granite provides service in
new hampshire maine and massachusetts

throughput for the transmission and storage segment totaled 12414 mdth for
2001 compared to 3954 mdth in 2000 the increase primarily reflects the
addition of columbia transmission and columbia gulf as a result of the
acquisition of columbia

net revenues

net revenues were 8836 million for 2001 an increase of 7126 million from
2000 this increase is primarily due to the inclusion of columbias operations
for a full twelve months in 2001 compared to two months in 2000

operating income

operating income of 3490 million in 2001 was an increase of 3014 million
from 2000 this increase was due primarily to the inclusion of columbias
operations for twelve months partially offset by an increase of 422 million
for twelve months of amortization of goodwill for the columbia acquisition in
addition the current year results compare favorably to 2000 due to the negative
impact for an asset impairment recognized in 2000

market conditions

the regulatory frameworks applicable to electric operations continue to work
through fundamental changes as noted below these changes will continue to have
an impact on nisources electric operations structure and profitability at the
same time competition within the industry will create opportunities to compete
for new customers and revenues management has taken steps to become more
competitive and profitable in this changing environment including shutting down
inefficient generating plant converting some of its generating units to allow
use of lower cost low sulfur coal and improving the transmission
interconnections with neighboring electric utilities

the overall weakening of the us economy is reflected in the 5594
gigawatthour gwh decline in sales to the industrial customer class in 2001
versus 2000 in particular the steel and steel related industries have been
adversely impacted by recent events and market conditions with two major
customers ltv corp and bethlehem steel corp declaring bankruptcy overall
deliveries to the steel industry were down 3458 gwh in 2001 versus the prior
year additionally uncollectible expense in the current year was 24 million
higher than the prior year reflecting steel industry bankruptcies

the summer cooling season weather in the electric service territory was 16
warmer in 2001 than the prior summer causing a 1303 kwh increase in sales to
residential and commercial class customers however the positive impact of the
warmer summer was tempered by the negative impact of a warmer than normal winter
heating season resulting in an annual 11 increase in cooling degree days and a
740 kwh increase in sales for the 2001 compared to 2000

restructuring

in december 2001 nisource announced a restructuring program designed to
generate greater efficiencies in field operations customer contact centers and

operations companies in october 2001 nisource executed a reorganization of
sales and marketing functions the current year results include 287 million in
expenses mainly for severance costs associated with these programs of this
total 225 million was included in the gas distribution segment operating
results with the remainder included in the electric segment results the
programs will result in a reduction of approximately 500 employees in field

as part of the restructuring programs and in response to the decline in electric
demand the mitchell station with a net capacity of 502 mw will be shutdown by
the end of the first quarter of 2002 originally constructed in 1955 this
facility has the oldest active operating units and is the least efficient
station in the northern indiana electric production system in addition to the
high level of ongoing maintenance costs there are substantial capital
investments that are necessary to comply with future environmental standards
costs totaling 22 million have been accrued for severance related to the plant
shutdown these costs for employee reductions are included in the 287
restructuring charge

regulatory matters

in 1999 ferc issued order 2000 addressing the formation and operation of rtos
on february 28 2001 northern indiana joined the alliance rto on december 18
2001 the iurc issued an order denying northern indianas request to transfer
functional control of its transmission facilities to the alliance rto on
december 20 2001 the ferc reversed prior orders that had preliminarily
approved the alliance rto and concluded that the alliance rto failed to meet
order 2000s scope and configuration requirements ferc ordered the alliance rto
companies including northern indiana to pursue membership in the midwest
independent system operator miso the alliance rto is actively negotiating to
become a part of the miso northern indiana has expended approximately 56
million related to joining the alliance rto the company believes that the
amounts spent will be recoverable also ferc has indicated that a december 15
2001 start date for rtos was not achievable and no alternative date has been
proposed although wholesale customers currently represent a small portion of
northern indianas electricity sales it intends to continue its efforts to
retain and add wholesale customers by offering competitive rates and also
intends to expand the customer base for which it provides transmission services

northern indiana has been recovering the costs of electric power purchased for
sale to its customers through the fuel adjustment clause the recovery provides
for cost to be collected if they are below a cap set based upon the costs of
northern indianas most expensive generating unit if costs exceed this cap
northern indiana must demonstrate why it should be allowed recovery before
recovery is approved in january 2002 northern indiana filed for approval to
implement a purchase power tracker ppt the ppt would allow recovery of all
costs related to purchasing electricity for use by northern indianas customers
on a periodic basis no actions have been taken by the iurc on this filing

during the course of a regularly scheduled review referred to as a level 1
review the staff of the iurc made a preliminary determination based on
unadjusted historical financial information filed by northern indiana that
northern indiana was earning returns that were in excess of its last rate order
and generally established standards despite efforts to explain to the iurc
staff several adjustments that needed to be made to the filed information to
make such an analysis meaningful the staff recommended that a formal
investigation be performed during 2001 northern indiana and several other
parties filed testimony participated in hearings and submitted proposed forms
of the order and comments on these proposed orders northern indianas testimony
indicated that if rates are to be changed they should be increased

environmental matters air the clean air act amendments of 1990 caaa impose
limits to control acid rain on the emission of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen
oxides nox which became fully effective in 2000 all of northern indianas
facilities are in compliance with the sulfur dioxide and nox limits

during 1998 the us environmental protection agency epa issued a final rule
the nox state implementation plan sip call requiring certain states
including indiana to reduce nox levels from several sources including
industrial and utility boilers the epa stated that the intent of the rule is to
lower regional transport of ozone impacting other states ability to attain the
federal ozone standard consistent with epa requirements the state of indiana
developed regulations implementing the control program which became effective
september 16 2001 the epa approved the state rules effective december 10
2001 compliance with the nox limits contained in these rules is required by may
31 2004 the nox emission limitations in the indiana rules are more restrictive
than those imposed on electric utilities under the caaas acid rain nox
reduction program described above capital estimates of northern indianas nox
control compliance costs range from 200 to 300 million over the next 2 years
actual compliance costs may vary depending on a number of factors including
market demandresource constraints uncertainty of future equipment and
construction costs and the potential need for additional control technology

in a matter related to the nox sip call several northeastern states have filed
petitions with the epa under section 126 of the clean air act the petitions
allege harm and request relief from sources of emissions in the midwest that
allegedly cause or contribute to ozone nonattainment in their states nisource
is monitoring the epas decisions on these petitions and existing litigation to
determine the impact of these developments on programs to reduce nox emissions
at northern indianas electric facilities

the epa issued final rules revising the national ambient air quality standards
for ozone and particulate matter in july 1997 on may 14 1999 the united
states court of appeals for the dc circuit remanded the new rules for both
ozone and particulate matters to the epa the court of appeals decision was
appealed to the supreme court which heard oral arguments on november 7 2000
the supreme court rendered a complex ruling on february 27 2001 that will
require some issues to be resolved by the dc circuit court and the epa before
final rulemaking occurs consequently final rules specifying a compliance
level deadline and controls necessary for compliance are not expected in the
near future resulting rules could require additional reductions in sulfur
dioxide particulate matter and nox emissions from coalfired boilers including
northern indianas electric generating stations beyond measures discussed
above final implementation methods will be set by the epa as well as state
regulatory authorities nisource believes that the costs relating to compliance
with any new limits may be substantial but are dependent upon the ultimate
control program agreed to by the targeted states and the epa and are currently
not reasonably estimable nisource will continue to closely monitor developments
in this area however the exact nature of the impact of the new standards on
its operations will not be known for some time

the epa has initiated enforcement actions against several electric utilities
alleging violations of the new source review provisions of the clean air act
northern indiana has received and is in the process of responding to information
requests from the epa on this subject it is impossible at this time to predict
the result of epas review of northern indianas information responses

initiatives are being discussed both in the united states and worldwide to
reduce socalled greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide a byproduct of
burning fossil fuels reduction of such emissions could result in significant
capital outlays or operating expenses for northern indiana

the caaa also contain other provisions that could lead to limitations on
emissions of hazardous air pollutants in response to the caaa requirements on
december 20 2000 the epa issued a finding that the regulation of emissions of
mercury and other air toxics from coal and oilfired electric steam generating
units is necessary and appropriate the epa expects to issue proposed
regulations by december 15 2003 and finalized regulations by december 15
2004 the potential impact if any to nisources financial results that may
occur because of any of these potential new regulations is unknown at this time

the epa is in the process of developing a program to address regional haze the
new administration announced that the epa would move forward with rules that
mandate the states to require power plants built between 1962 and 1977 to
install the best available retrofit technology or bart the bart program will
target for control by 2013 those pollutants that limit visibility namely
particulate sulfur dioxide andor nitrogen oxides until the program is
developed northern indiana cannot predict the cost of complying with these
rules

water the great lakes water quality initiative gli program is expected to
add new water quality standards for facilities that discharge into the great
lakes watershed including northern indianas three electric generating stations
located on lake michigan the state of indiana has promulgated its regulations
for this water discharge permit program and has received final epa approval as
promulgated the regulations would provide the indiana department of
environmental management idem with the authority to grant water quality
criteria variances and exemptions for noncontact cooling water however the
epa revised the variance language and other minor provisions of idems gli rule
the epa by and large left the noncontact cooling water exemption intact
however a separate agreement between the epa and idem on interpretation of this
exemption still leaves uncertainty as to its impact the epa change to the
variance rule has prompted litigation by the affected industrial parties and the
epaidem agreement on the noncontact cooling water exemption may be subject to
future litigation northern indiana expects that idem will issue a proposed
permit renewal for each of its lakeside stations pending the outcome of
litigation and the proposed permit renewal requirements the costs of complying
with these requirements cannot be predicted at this time

remediation northern indiana is a prp at four waste disposal sites under cercla
and similar state laws and may be required to share in the cost of cleanup of
such sites in addition northern indiana has corrective action liability under
rcra for closure and cleanup costs associated with treatment storage and
disposal sites as of december 31 2001 a reserve of approximately 22 million
has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions at these
sites the ultimate liability in connection with these sites will depend upon
many factors including the volume of material contributed to the site years of
ownership of operations the number of other prps and their financial viability
and the extent of environmental response required based upon investigations and
managements understanding of current environmental laws and regulations
nisource believes that any environmental response required will not have a
material effect on its financial position or results of operations

sales

electric sales for 2001 of 154895 gwh decreased 4918 gwh compared to 2000
due primarily to reduced industrial sales reflecting the economic downturn and
steel industry bankruptcies partially offset by the impact of warmer weather
in 2000 electric sales of 159813 gwh increased 3056 gwh from 1999

net revenues

electric net revenues of 7546 million for 2001 decreased by 47 million from
2000 primarily reflecting the reduced deliveries to the industrial segment the
positive impact of slightly warmer weather in the second quarter was offset by
slightly cooler weather in the third quarter in 2000 electric net revenues of
7593 million were relatively unchanged from 1999

operating income

operating income for 2001 was 3096 million a decrease of 61 million from
2000 this is due to lower net revenues discussed above and higher operating
expenses of 14 million the 2001 operating expenses included increased
uncollectible expenses of 24 million and restructuring charges of 62
million

operating income for 2000 was 3157 million a decrease of 83 million from
1999 this was due to higher operating expenses attributable to generally
increased operating costs and higher depreciation expense as result of
additional plant in service these higher expenses were partially offset by
lower other taxes

change in accounting method

during the fourth quarter of 2001 nisource changed its method of accounting for
acquisition exploration and development activities related to oil and gas
reserves from the full cost method to the successful efforts method under the
successful efforts method of accounting except for property acquisition costs
only costs associated with specific discovered reserves are capitalized
capitalized costs include mineral interests in properties wells and related
equipment and facilities support equipment and uncompleted wells depletion
expense is equal to annual production multiplied by the depletion rate per unit
that is derived by spreading the total costs capitalized under successful
efforts over the number of units expected to be extracted over the life of the
reserves on a lease basis compared to the full cost method the change to
successful efforts reduced operating income by 53 million and 103 million
for 2001 and 2000 respectively

forward sale of natural gas

in 1999 and 2000 a subsidiary of columbia resources entered into agreements
with mahonia ii limited mahonia whereby the subsidiary agreed to sell 1567
bcf of natural gas to mahonia for the period february 2000 through july 2005 on
march 30 2001 the subsidiary restructured its existing forward gas sales
agreements with mahonia to postpone physical deliveries of 199 bcf of natural
gas originally scheduled for the period april 2001 through march 2002 these
deliveries have been scheduled to resume in january 2003 and continue through
february 2006 the restructuring also increased the amount of gas to be
delivered by 317 bcf

the forward sales under the mahonia agreements have been guaranteed through the
use of surety bonds with indemnity values amounting to approximately 2940
million declining over time the surety bonds have ratings triggers if the
credit rating of columbia falls below bbb at standard and poors or baa2 at
moodys columbias longterm debt ratings are currently bbb and baa2 at
standard and poors and moodys respectively the collateral requirement from a
downgrade below the ratings trigger levels would require the posting of a letter
of credit in the amount of approximately 2940 million declining over time

primary energy

primary energy is currently involved in six projects that are concerned with the
generation of electricity steam or thermal energy on the sites of industrial
customers five projects generate energy from process streams or fuel provided
by the industrial customers the energy is then delivered to the industrial
customers under longterm contracts providing for tolling fees sublease
payments unit sale payments or processing fees one project whiting clean
energy will obtain natural gas to produce electricity for sale in the wholesale
markets and steam for industrial use

each project is developed by a whollyowned subsidiary the lessee of primary
energy the lessee leases the facility after completion of construction from a
nonaffiliated special purpose entity the lessor which owns the facility
and advances the funds for construction the lessor obtains funding primarily
from bank borrowings or a private placement of notes secured by the lessors
rights in the facility the indebtedness of the lessor is not treated as
indebtedness of nisource under generally accepted accounting principles in the
united states the lease payments from the lessee to the lessor are based on a
return on the amounts advanced plus any amortization of the amounts advanced
with respect to three of the projects the costs of the project financing depend
on the debt rating on nisources outstanding commercial paper or longterm debt

the projects are located on the customers premises pursuant to longterm ground
leases the responsibility for operation and maintenance lies directly with the
industrial customers for two of the projects and with the lessee on the
remaining projects where the lessee is responsible for the operation and
maintenance it contracts with third parties to manage and perform the operation
and maintenance activities

nisource either directly or through capital markets has guaranteed or in
substance guaranteed most lease payments to the lessors including regular lease
payments accelerated lease payments on an event of default and payment
obligations including residual guarantee amounts at the end of lease terms in
the case of an event of default a lessor can accelerate the full unamortized
amount of the lessors funding the aggregate unamortized funding for all the
projects at december 31 2001 was 6297 million

at the end of an initial lease term the lessee has the right to purchase the
facility for the unamortized amount of the lessors funding if the lessee

lessee may be responsible for a residual guarantee amount since the energy
contracts with the industrial customers are longterm and typically extend past
the initial lease term one strategy is to attempt to refinance the
property and extend the lease term

the present value of a lessees aggregate liability for lease payments and
residual guarantees is generally limited to an amount equal to less than 90 of
the amount advanced the following table shows by year future minimum rental
payments including maximum residual guarantee amounts and additional amounts

primary energys whiting clean energy project at bps whiting indiana refinery
has incurred delays primarily associated with remediating damage that occurred
during commissioning in september 2001 the delays have also resulted in an
increase in estimated project costs and the need for approximately 20 million
of additional funding primary energy has asserted a claim against the
construction contractor relating to the delay the project is expected to be
capable of producing electricity in the first quarter of 2002 at a total cost
of approximately 320 million

in addition to the construction issues at the whiting clean energy facility
nisource projects that the facility will operate at a loss based on the current
market view of forward pricing in the gas and electric markets for 2002 the
aftertax loss is projected to be approximately 160 million the profitability
of the project in future periods will be dependent on among other things
prevailing prices in the energy markets and regional load dispatch patterns

primary energys ironside project at ltv steel companys east chicago indiana
mill has been negatively impacted by ltvs bankruptcy filing in december 2000
and ltvs december 2001 decision to idle the steel mill the ironside facility
is complete in all material respects however the facility cannot currently be
operated on an economic basis if the mill is not operating in addition there
can be no guarantee that ltv will not reject the project contracts in connection
with the bankruptcy in which event the lessee will have limited contract
damages against ltv and the status of an unsecured creditor primary energy
believes that the ironside project brings economic value to the operator of the
mill by utilizing energy waste streams to generate electricity for the mill at
attractive prices however there can be no assurance that any successor to ltv
will reopen the mill or be willing to restructure the transaction on an economic
basis to primary energy the winner of the bids for the purchase of ltvs steel
mill will be determined on february 28 2002 the total cost of the ironside
project is approximately 67 million

the lease at primary energys north lake project is due to expire in june 2002
of the several options available the most likely outcomes are that the project
will be refinanced and the lease will be extended or that the lessee will
purchase the project at its unamortized cost of approximately 38 million if
the lessee purchases the project the payment will be funded by nisource the
strategy at this time is to pursue refinancing

in an event of default the partnership will be required to pay a stipulated
amount under the lease this amount was 347 million as of december 31 2001

net revenues

net revenues of 1130 million for 2001 decreased 408 million from 2000 the
reduction is primarily due to mark to market loss on january east coast trades
and limited trading opportunities this decrease is partially offset by
increases in electric wheeling due to upgraded interconnections with neighboring
electric companies and increases in power marketing

net revenues for 2000 were 1538 million compared to 1096 million in 1999
the improvement is due primarily to the addition of significant asset management
contracts in the tpc portfolio and the full year effect in 2000 of tpc
operations tpc was acquired in april 1999

operating income

merchant operations reported operating income of 222 million a decrease of
568 million from 2000 the reduction is primarily due to mark to market loss
on january east coast trades limited trading opportunities and a fourth quarter
charge of 160 million related to the enron bankruptcy

operating income of 790 million in 2000 was an increase of 295 million from
1999 the improvement is due primarily to the addition of significant asset
management contracts in the tpc portfolio and the full year effect in 2000 of
tpc operations

telecommunications network

as a result of project delays cost overruns and a decline in the fiber optics
market that have occurred since the acquisition of columbia nisource recorded a
charge of 92 million to operating income in the second quarter of 2001
related to transcom a fiber optics telecommunications network

in september and october 2000 management held discussions with investment
banking firms seeking strategic options for the transcom assets although
significant uncertainties existed surrounding the estimated costs to complete
the fiber optic network time to market in a competitive environment and delays
due to construction deficiencies and environmental issues management decided to
complete the transcom network and sell the completed network

the company received subsequent information pertaining to the estimated
construction costs and delays consequently management concluded that the
carrying value of the telecommunication assets exceeded the realizable value by
approximately 892 million consequently goodwill resulting from the
acquisition of columbia was increased by a substantial portion of such excess
carrying amount 520 million aftertax

in august 2001 transcom invited potential buyers to submit bids for the assets
based on these bids present market conditions preclude transcom from realizing
the carrying value of the assets by selling at the present time therefore
management has decided to operate the network while continuing to evaluate
market conditions for possible sale at december 31 2001 the anticipated cash
flow from transcoms business plan indicates that the assets current carrying
value is realizable however economic and other events may adversely affect the
transcoms ability to achieve such plan

sale of underground locating and marking service

on january 28 2002 nisource sold all of the issued and outstanding capital
stock of smp a wholly owned subsidiary of nisource to the laclede group inc
for 379 million smp operates an underground locating and marking service in
ten midwestern states in the first quarter of 2002 nisource will recognize an
aftertax gain of 103 million related to the sale the net assets of smp were
reported as assets held for sale on the consolidated balance sheets

environmental matters

transcom in spring 2000 transcom received directives from the philadelphia
district of the us army corps of engineers philadelphia district and an
administrative order from pennsylvania department of environmental protection
pa dep addressing alleged violations of federal and state laws resulting from
construction activities associated with transcoms laying fiber optic cable
along portions of a route between washington dc and new york city the order
and directives required transcom to largely cease construction activities on
september 18 2000 transcom entered into a voluntary settlement agreement with
the philadelphia district under which transcom contributed 12 million to the
pennsylvania chapter of the nature conservancy and the philadelphia district
lifted its directives as a result of the voluntary agreement with the
philadelphia district and communications with the pa

a consent order and agreement with the pa dep in settlement of its enforcement
action under which transcom paid 80633 in penalties and 223567 to fund six
community environmental projects

other affiliates nisource affiliates have retained environmental cleanup
liability associated with some its former companies including columbia propane
columbia petroleum and certain local gas distribution companies the primary
environmental liability associated with former propane operations relates to a
former manufactured gas plant mgp site in wisconsin for which reserves have
been accrued environmental liability associated with former petroleum
operations includes relatively minor cleanups of product spills at third party
properties and liability for preexisting environmental conditions at former
petroleum terminals a nisource affiliate also retains liability for two former
mgp sites associated with a local gas distribution company in new york for
which reserves have been accrued

the ultimate liability in connection with these sites will depend upon many
factors including the extent of environmental response actions required other
prps and their financial viability and indemnification from previous facility
owners only those corrective action costs currently known and determinable can
be considered probable and reasonably estimable under sfas no 5 and
consistent with sop no 961 as costs become probable and reasonably estimable
reserves will be adjusted as appropriate nisource believes that any
environmental response actions required at former operations for which it is
ultimately liable after consideration of insurance coverage and contributions
from other prps will not have a material adverse effect on nisources financial
position

net operating revenues

net operating revenues of 461 million for 2001 decreased by 279 million from
2000 this decrease is due to the sale of noncore businesses partially offset
by higher revenues in the line locating business

net operating revenues of 740 million for 2000 increased by 97 million from
1999 this increase is primarily due to higher revenues in the line locating
business

operating income loss

the other segment reported an operating loss of 672 million in 2001 versus an
operating loss of 280 million in 2000 reflecting the impairment of
telecommunication assets the settlement of litigation related to market hub
partners mhp which was sold in 2000 and negative impact of winding down
noncore businesses

other reported an operating loss of 280 million for 2000 versus an operating
loss of 73 million in 1999
