research and development 

  

garmin’s product innovations are driven by its strong emphasis on research and development and the close partnership between garmin’s engineering and manufacturing teams garmin’s products are created by its engineering and development staff garmin’s manufacturing staff includes manufacturing process engineers who work closely with garmin’s design engineers to ensure manufacturability and manufacturing cost control for its products garmin’s development staff includes industrial designers as well as software engineers electrical engineers mechanical engineers and cartographic engineers garmin believes the industrial design of its products has played an important role in garmin’s success 

  

manufacturing and operations 

  

garmin believes one of its core competencies and strengths is its vertically integrated manufacturing capabilities at its taiwan facilities in xizhi jhongli linkou and xinshi its china facility in yangzhou its netherlands facility in oegstgeest its poland facility in wroclaw and at its us facilities in olathe kansas and salem oregon garmin believes that its ownership and operation of its own manufacturing facilities and distribution networks provides significant capability and flexibility to address the breadth and depth of resources necessary to serve its diverse products and markets 

  

specifically garmin believes that the vertical integration of its manufacturing capabilities provides advantages to product cost quality and time to market 

  

cost garmin’s manufacturing resources rapidly and iteratively prototype designs concepts products and processes achieving higher efficiency and resulting in lower cost garmin’s vertical integration approach enables leveraging of manufacturing resources across high mid and low volume products sharing of these resources across product lines favorably affects garmin’s costs to produce its range of products with lower volume products realizing the economies of scale of higher volume products the ownership and integration of its resources allows garmin to optimize the design for manufacturing of its products yielding improved cost 

  

quality garmin’s automation and advanced production processes provide inservice robustness and consistent reliability standards that enable garmin to maintain strict process and quality control of the products manufactured thereby improving the overall quality of our products additionally the immediate feedback throughout the manufacturing processes is shared with the development teams providing integrated continuous improvement throughout design and supply chain 

  

garmin’s design manufacturing distribution and service functions in its us taiwan china and uk facilities are certified to iso 9001 an international quality standard developed by the international organization for standardization iso garmin’s automotive operations in taiwan china uk and olathe have achieved iatf 16949 certification a quality standard for automotive suppliers garmin’s olathe kansas and salem oregon aviation operations in the us have achieved certification to as9100 a quality standard for the aviation industry garmin has also implemented multiple health and safety management systems and achieved certification to the iso 45001 standard for health and safety management at facilities in the us taiwan and china 

  

time to market garmin uses multidisciplinary teams of design engineers process engineers and supply chain specialists to develop products allowing them to quickly move from concept to manufacturing this integrated ownership provides inherent flexibility to enable faster time to market 

  

materials 

  

garmin purchases components from a large number of qualified suppliers although many components essential to garmin’s business are generally available from multiple sources certain key components are currently obtained by the company from single or limited sources which subjects garmin to supply and pricing risks for these components we have limited nearterm flexibility to use other suppliers if a current vendor becomes unavailable or is unable to meet our requirements while extended disruptions at these suppliers could impact our ability to meet customer demand due to component shortages or increased lead times or cause us to incur higher product costs we believe these potential disruptions would not disproportionately disadvantage us relative to our competitors 

  

seasonality 

  

our net sales are subject to seasonal fluctuation sales of our consumer products are generally higher in the fourth quarter due to increased demand during the holiday buying season and to a lesser extent the second quarter due to increased demand during the spring and summer season sales of consumer products are also influenced by the timing of the release of new products our aviation and auto oem products do not experience much seasonal variation but are more influenced by the timing of aircraft certifications regulatory mandates auto program manufacturing and the release of new products when the initial demand is typically the strongest 

  

intellectual property 

  

our success and ability to compete is dependent in part on our proprietary technology we rely on a combination of patent copyright trademark and trade secret laws as well as confidentiality agreements to establish and protect our proprietary rights in addition garmin often relies on licenses of intellectual property for use in its business 

  

as of january 4 2022 garmin has been issued over 1700 patents throughout the world and holds more than 1000 trademark registrations the duration of patents varies in accordance with the provisions of applicable local law we believe that our continued success depends on the intellectual skills of our employees and their ability to continue to innovate garmin will continue to file and prosecute patent applications when appropriate to attempt to protect garmin’s rights in its proprietary technologies 

  

there is no assurance that our current patents or patents which we may later acquire may successfully withstand any challenge in whole or in part it is also possible that any patent issued to us may not provide us with any competitive advantages or that the patents of others will preclude us from manufacturing and marketing certain products despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights to protect our trade secrets to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others or to defend against claims of infringement or invalidity 

  

environmental matters 

  

garmin’s operations are subject to various environmental laws including laws addressing air and water pollution and management of hazardous substances and wastes substantial noncompliance with applicable environmental laws could have a material adverse effect on our business capital expenditures for environmental controls are included in our normal capital budget historically capital expenditures associated with environmental controls have not been material and compliance with environmental laws has not had a material impact on the company’s competitive position 

  

many of garmins products are subject to laws relating to the chemical and material composition of our products and their energy efficiency garmin is also subject to extended producer responsibility laws and regulations requiring manufacturers to be responsible for collection recovery and recycling of wastes from certain electronic products historically compliance with environmental laws has not had a material impact on our profitability we have processes to monitor environmental law changes and to evaluate the potential impact of such laws to our business but the impact of future enactment of environmental laws cannot yet be fully determined and could be substantial 

  

garmin has a global environmental policy and is committed to working to protect the environment throughout various aspects of our business garmin has implemented multiple environmental management systems and achieved certification to the iso 14001 standard for environmental management at facilities in the us uk taiwan and china 

  

garmin strives to reduce our environmental impact by increasing our environmental sustainability efforts garmin is committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions through direct carbon emissions reduction and elimination strategies garmin has several locations that utilize renewable electricity including facilities in olathe kansas garmin also has made efforts to reduce waste and increase recycling and composting 

  

human capital 

  

successful execution of our strategy is dependent on attracting developing and retaining key employees and members of our management team to facilitate talent attraction and retention we strive to provide opportunities for our employees to grow and develop in their careers supported by generous compensation and benefits and through programs that build connections between our employees and their communities 

  

as of december 25 2021 the company had approximately 18700 full and parttime employees worldwide of whom approximately 6400 were in the americas region 9700 were in apac asia pacific and australian continent and 2600 were in emea europe the middle east and africa garmin’s vertical integration model enables us to provide a variety of opportunities across many different professions including engineering human resources information technology marketing sales and operations the company’s products are created by its engineering and development staff which numbered approximately 5300 people worldwide as of december 25 2021 garmin’s manufacturing staff which numbered approximately 8200 people worldwide as of december 25 2021 includes manufacturing process engineers who work closely with garmin’s design engineers to ensure manufacturability and manufacturing cost control for its products 

  

garmin respects the right of all employees to form and join an association to represent their interests as employees to organize and to bargain collectively or individually we also respect any employee’s choice to refrain from joining a union except for some of garmin’s employees in sweden none of garmin’s employees are represented by a labor union and none of garmins north american or taiwan employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement we believe our efforts in managing our workforce have been effective as evidenced by a strong company culture and positive relations between the company and our employees 

  

we offer a range of generous benefits to our employees that enable us to attract and retain leading talent in addition to salaries these programs which vary by countryregion include stock awards retirement plans healthcare and insurance benefits health savings and flexible spending accounts paid time off family leave and an employee stock purchase plan which provides employees an opportunity to acquire company ownership for a discounted price we also invest significant resources in our talent development programs to provide employees with the training and education they need to help achieve their career goals build relevant skills and lead their organizations employee resource groups provide opportunities for employees to connect network and become involved in community engagement initiatives 

  

we support local community engagement initiatives where we have a business presence and we provide opportunities for employees to give back to those communities one such initiative is through active engagement in science technology engineering and math “stem” community outreach programs our strategic aim in these educational programs is to educate and encourage local students to pursue careers in the engineering field especially those in underrepresented groups which we believe benefits not only our company but the overall industry 

  




 item 1ari sk factors 

the risks described below are not the only ones facing our company additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also impair our business operations if any of the following risks occur our business financial condition or operating results could be materially adversely affected 

risks related to the company 

if we are not successful in the continued development timely manufacture and introduction of new products or product categories overall demand for our products could decrease to the extent that lost sales and profits are not entirely offset 

we expect that a significant portion of our future revenue will continue to be derived from sales of newly introduced products the market for our products is characterized by rapidly changing technology evolving industry standards and changes in customer needs if we fail to introduce new products or to modify or improve our existing products in response to changes in technology industry standards or customer needs our products could rapidly become less competitive or obsolete we must continue to make significant investments in research and development in order to continue to develop new products enhance existing products and achieve market acceptance for such products however there can be no assurance that development stage products will be successfully completed or if developed will achieve significant customer acceptance 

if we are unable to successfully develop and introduce competitive new products and enhance our existing products our future results of operations would be materially adversely affected our pursuit of necessary technology may require substantial time and expense we may need to license new technologies to respond to technological change these licenses may not be available to us on terms that we can accept or may materially change the gross profits that we are able to obtain on our products we may not succeed in adapting our products to new technologies as they emerge development and manufacturing schedules for technology products are difficult to predict and there can be no assurance that we will achieve timely initial customer shipments of new products the timely availability of these products in volume and their acceptance by customers are important to our future success any future challenges related to new products whether due to product development delays manufacturing delays supply chain constraints lack of market acceptance delays in regulatory approval or otherwise could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

if we are unable to compete effectively with existing or new competitors the associated loss of competitive position could result in price reductions fewer customer orders reduced margins and loss of market share 

the markets for many of our products are highly competitive and we expect competition to increase in the future some of our competitors have significantly greater financial technical and marketing resources than we do these competitors may be able to respond more rapidly to new or emerging technologies or changes in customer requirements they may also be able to devote greater resources to the development promotion and sale of their products or secure better product positioning with retailers increased competition could result in price reductions fewer customer orders reduced margins and loss of market share our failure to compete successfully against current or future competitors could seriously harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

public health emergencies or outbreaks of epidemics pandemics or contagious diseases have had and will likely continue to have significant impacts on our business 

  

widespread public health emergencies or outbreaks of epidemics pandemics or contagious diseases such as the covid19 pandemic have had and will likely continue to have significant impacts on our business the covid19 pandemic continues to rapidly evolve creating disruption and uncertainty around the world which has resulted in and we expect will continue to result in a change in overall demand for certain of our products and other operational impacts there are unknown factors such as the duration and severity of the pandemic evolving variants of the virus that causes covid19 and the efficacy of vaccines against those variants the nature and length of actions taken by governments businesses and individuals to contain or mitigate its impact the severity and duration of the economic impact caused by the pandemic the uncertainty surrounding the distribution and uptake of vaccines the impact of employees who are unable to work due to quarantine requirements or who decline to adhere to governmentmandated vaccination or testing requirements along with the effectiveness of our response that may materially impact our business operations results of operations and its ultimate impact on our financial condition 

  

demand for certain of our products has been and may continue to be affected in several ways during the covid19 pandemic some consumers have been and may continue to be less able or less likely to purchase certain of our products due to economic hardships governmental restrictions affecting them and the retail outlets that sell our products voluntary behavior changes associated with public health guidance the prioritization of other goods and services by online retailers that sell our products restrictions on the ability of online retailers to ship products to certain areas the cancellation of trade shows and other events that are otherwise important in the marketing and sale of our products and the potential failure and closure of retail outlets and online retailers that sell our products certain of our sales and distribution offices have experienced and may again experience temporary closure due to governmental restrictions additional or prolonged closures of certain sales and distribution offices could affect our ability to market and distribute products to meet customer demand the adverse impacts of the pandemic have created economic stress in the global marketplace periods of high levels of unemployment loss of income andor wealth for some individuals and general economic uncertainty these conditions have affected and are expected to continue to affect the willingness or ability of some customers to purchase certain of our products or those of original equipment manufacturers in which our products are installed we have also experienced increased demand for certain of our products during the covid19 pandemic as consumer behavior and demand shifted toward products offered by our fitness outdoor and marine segments and our aviation and auto segments have trended positively subsequent to the initial declines in those segments it is not yet known whether certain of these behaviors and demand will persist and there has been a decline in the demand for certain of these products and may be a decline in demand for others as people return to prepandemic lifestyles 

  

our supply chain has been and may continue to be adversely impacted by the covid19 pandemic we have experienced delays in procuring and may continue to be unable to procure certain components from our suppliers and the cost of procuring certain components has increased and could continue to increase we have faced logistics constraints and higher freight costs the scope and severity of which may intensify reduced demand for certain of our products has resulted in and may continue to result in reduced utilization of certain of our manufacturing facilities and higher perunit costs for certain products certain of our manufacturing facilities have experienced and may in the future experience inopportune temporary closures or reduced hours which could adversely affect the costs incurred to produce our products and our ability to meet demand 

  

the covid19 pandemic has had and will continue to have several other operational impacts on our business which has and may continue to include employees working remotely temporarily ceasing operations in some offices due to government restrictions business travel restrictions and the cancellation of events that are otherwise important in the development marketing and sale of our products these changes in our business operations may result in reduced efficiency and lower productivity we have incurred and may continue to incur increased costs as we provide additional benefits to assist our employees during the covid19 pandemic and provide a safe and healthy workplace for employees who continue to work in our facilities similar operational and financial hardships on our business partners may result in aged or uncollectable receivables and the reduced demand for certain of our products could result in obsolescence of certain inventory if the economy experiences a sustained downturn of significant proportion that impacts portions of our business we may also need to incur the costs and organizational impacts of personnel restructuring 

  

additional risks and impacts including gross margin fluctuation foreign currency fluctuations product development challenges impacts to our key personnel and dependencies on third party suppliers may be heightened as a result of the covid19 pandemic and evolving variants of the virus that causes covid19 there are further unknown risks and impacts due to the uncertainty and rapidly evolving nature of the pandemic including but not limited to uncertainty around the evolution of the pandemic the unprecedented imposition of preventative measures by governments that impact the economy and normal operations of a business and the timing and manner of relaxation of those measures potential future health emergencies may present risks and impacts similar to the ongoing covid19 pandemic if we are unable to manage these risks and uncertainties our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially impacted 

maturation or contraction of the market for wearable devices or categories of these devices could adversely affect our revenue and profits 

we have experienced annual growth in sales and profits in our outdoor and fitness segments which have benefited from increased sales of wearable devices if the overall wearable device market declines or categories of devices within the wearable device market decline significantly our business financial condition or operating results could be materially adversely affected 

  

we depend on third party suppliers and licensors some of which are sole source for technology and components used in our products our production and business would be seriously harmed if these suppliers or licensors are not able to meet our demand and alternative sources are not available or if the costs of components rise 

  

we are dependent on third party suppliers for various components used in our current products some of the components that we procure from third party suppliers include semiconductors and electroluminescent panels liquid crystal displays memory chips batteries and microprocessors the availability of highquality components at reasonable cost is essential to the successful production and sale of our products some components we use are from sole source suppliers 

  

we have and may continue to experience shortages of certain components as well as delays in procuring certain components in addition a shortage in supply of components may result in an increase of the costs of procuring these components if suppliers are unable to meet our demand for components on a timely basis or if we are unable to obtain components from an alternative source or if the price of alternative components is prohibitive our ability to maintain timely and costeffective production of our products would be seriously harmed 

  

our products are also dependent on certain licensed technology and content if we are unable to continue sourcing such technology and content from our licensors and are unable to obtain an alternative source or if our relationships with our licensors change detrimentally our ability to provide certain features in our products would be seriously harmed 

  

we expect to make significant investments in the auto oem operating segment for the foreseeable future which would continue to negatively impact total company profits and may negatively impact shareholder value if the operating segment fails to become profitable 

  

we have been awarded several tierone and tiertwo auto oem supplier contracts to fulfill the associated program commitments we are investing significantly in facilities research and development and other operating expenses and expect to continue doing so in the coming years gross margins associated with these auto oem programs will negatively impact consolidated gross margin as auto oem revenue increases as a percentage of consolidated revenue if we are not successful in winning additional contracts and substantially leveraging our investments operating losses in the auto oem segment will continue to negatively impact total company profits and may negatively impact shareholder value we may incur substantial restructuring costs if we are unable to generate profits from auto oem contracts 

  

our business and reputation have been and are expected to continue to be impacted by information technology system failures and network disruptions 

  

the company and its global supply chain have experienced and are expected to continue to be exposed to information technology system failures and network disruptions including those caused by natural disasters accidents power disruptions telecommunications failures acts of terrorism or war computer viruses physical or electronic breakins and ransomware or other cybersecurity incidents 

  

we have technology and processes in place designed to detect and respond to such failures and disruptions however because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access disable or degrade service or sabotage systems and the nature of other potential incidents changes frequently and may be difficult to detect for long periods of time our detection and response measures may be ineffective or inadequate furthermore even with appropriate training conducted in support of such measures human errors and omissions may still occur resulting in system failures andor disruptions to our information technology infrastructure therefore the company’s business continuity and disaster recovery planning or those of others in our global supply chain may not be able to sufficiently mitigate all threats 

  

such failures or disruptions can materially adversely affect our business reputation results of operations and financial condition through among other things a disruption of internal operations including order processing invoicing and manufacturing and distribution of products and a loss of functionality of critical systems and online services actual or anticipated attacks and risks have caused and are expected to continue to cause us to incur increasing costs including costs to deploy additional personnel and protection technologies to conduct additional employee training and to engage third party security experts and consultants although we maintain cyber insurance coverage that subject to policy terms and conditions and significant selfinsured retentions is designed to address certain aspects of cyber risks such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise 

  

losses or unauthorized access to or releases of proprietary or confidential information including personal information could result in significant reputational financial legal and operational consequences 

  

we have experienced and are expected to continue to experience malicious attacks and other attempts to gain unauthorized access to our systems that seek to compromise the confidentiality integrity or availability of proprietary and confidential information a breach of our security systems and procedures or those of others in our global supply chain could result in significant data losses or theft of our intellectual property confidential and proprietary information or that of our business partners as well as our users’ or employees personal information which could compromise our competitive position reputation operating results and financial condition also if we fail to reasonably maintain the security of our intellectual property confidential and proprietary information or that of our business partners or the personal information of our users or employees we may be subject to private litigation government investigations regulatory proceedings enforcement actions and cause us to incur potentially significant liability damages or remediation costs although we maintain cyber insurance coverage that subject to policy terms and conditions and significant selfinsured retentions is designed to address certain aspects of cyber risks such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise 

  

our business may suffer if we are not able to hire and retain sufficient qualified personnel or if we lose our key personnel 

  

our future success depends significantly on the continued contribution of our key executive engineering sales marketing manufacturing and administrative personnel recruiting and retaining the skilled personnel we require to maintain and grow our market position has been and is expected to continue to be difficult the overall shortage in qualified workforce personnel combined with the increased willingness of companies to hire such personnel in fully remote positions has and in the future may continue to increase our compensation costs in order for us to retain such personnel if we fail to hire and retain qualified employees our business and growth prospects will be harmed 

  

we currently do not have employment agreements with any of our key executive officers swiss law prohibits us from paying severance payments to our senior executive officers which may impair our ability to recruit for these positions we do not have key person life insurance on any of our key executive officers and do not currently intend to obtain such insurance the loss of the services of any of our senior level management or other key employees could harm our business 

  

we may experience unique economic and political risks associated with companies that operate in taiwan 

  

our principal manufacturing facilities are located in taiwan deterioration of relations between taiwan and the people’s republic of china also referred to as the prc and other factors affecting the political or economic conditions of taiwan in the future could cause disruption to our manufacturing operations which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations and the market price and the liquidity of our shares 

  

the prc asserts sovereignty over all of china including taiwan certain other islands and all of mainland china the prc government does not recognize the legitimacy of the taiwan government although significant economic and cultural relations exist between taiwan and the prc the prc government has indicated that it may use military force to gain control over taiwan in certain circumstances such as the declaration of independence by taiwan there is also a risk that the prc government may unilaterally seek to occupy taiwan by force if necessary without a clear triggering event in this scenario garmin’s manufacturing facilities in taiwan could be subject to disruptions that could have a material negative impact to our operations the united states relations with taiwan are governed by the 1979 taiwan relations act which signifies when the us switched diplomatic recognition from taiwan to the prc referred to as the onechina policy deviations from the onechina policy could lead to adverse changes in chinaus and chinataiwan relations and could materially adversely affect our operations in taiwan in the future 

  

changes in applicable tax laws or resolutions of tax disputes could result in adverse tax consequences to the company 

  

our tax positions could be adversely impacted by changes to tax laws tax treaties or tax regulations or the interpretation or enforcement thereof by any tax authority in which we file income tax returns particularly in the us switzerland taiwan and united kingdom uk we cannot predict the outcome of any specific legislative proposals 

  

global taxing standards continue to evolve as a result of the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd recommendations aimed at preventing perceived base erosion and profit shifting beps by multinational corporations while these recommendations do not change tax law the countries where we operate may implement legislation or take unilateral actions which may result in adverse effects to our income tax provision and financial statements partially to respond to changes to global tax standards we initiated an intercompany transaction in 2020 which migrates ownership of certain intellectual property from switzerland to the united states which is the primary location of research development and executive management at the end of this migration a higher percentage of income will be recognized in the us due to the subjectivity inherent in transfer pricing associated with this intercompany transaction we are pursuing an advanced pricing agreement with relevant jurisdictions to provide certainty regarding the pricing however we are unable to predict the outcome of the final advanced pricing agreement and related negotiations which could materially andor adversely impact our income tax provision net income or cash flows for periods during negotiation and upon finalization 

  

in 2021 the oecd continued work on the beps project by issuing a statement regarding a twopillar solution which includes within “pillar two” a global minimum tax numerous countries have signed onto the oecd statement including switzerland the us and the uk recently switzerland’s federal council proposed legislation which would implement a minimum tax of 15 in 2024 neither the oecd statement nor proposed legislation changes actual tax law but these actions may lead to legislation in those countries in which we operate the passage of a minimum tax may result in an increase in the tax paid by the company which could materially andor adversely impact our income tax provision and financial statements 

  

significant judgment is required in determining our global provision for income taxes in the ordinary course of our business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain most notably in the area of transfer pricing we are regularly under audit by tax authorities although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals the results of an audit or litigation could have a material effect on our income tax provision net income or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made 

  

changes to trade regulations including trade restrictions sanctions or tariffs could significantly harm our results of operations 

  

trade and other international disputes can result in tariffs sanctions and other measures that restrict international trade and can adversely affect our business for example tensions between the us and the prc have led to a series of tariffs being imposed by the us on imports from the prc many other countries have considered or imposed similar measures the imposition of additional governmental controls or regulations that create new or enhanced restrictions on free trade trade sanctions or tariffs particularly those applicable to materials or goods from the prc could have a substantial adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

our results of operations and financial condition are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency translation 

  

the movement of foreign currencies relative to the us dollar affects the us dollar value of the company’s foreign currencydenominated sales the weakening of foreign currencies relative to the us dollar could have a significant effect on our revenue gross margin and profitability or may cause the company to raise international pricing which could potentially reduce demand for our products conversely a strengthening of certain foreign currencies relative to the us dollar could increase product costs and operating expenses denominated in those currencies thus adversely affecting gross margins and profitability we have not historically used financial instruments to hedge our foreign currency exchange rate risks 

  

we have experienced significant foreign currency gains and losses due to the strengthening and weakening of the us dollar relative to certain other currencies the majority of our consolidated foreign currency gain or loss is typically driven by exchange rate impacts on the significant cash receivables and payables held in a currency other than the functional currency at a given legal entity such gain or loss will create variations in our earnings per share however because there is minimal cash impact caused by such exchange rate variations management will continue to focus on our operating performance before the impact of foreign currency gains and losses 

  

economic regulatory and political conditions and uncertainty could adversely affect our revenue and profits 

  

our revenue and profits depend significantly on general economic conditions and the demand for products in the markets in which we compete we have operations outside the united states that make up a significant portion of our total revenue which can present challenges depending on economic and geopolitical conditions on both a global and regional scale economic weakness or constrained consumer and business spending has resulted in periods of decreased revenue in the past and could in the future result in decreased revenue and problems with our ability to manage inventory levels and collect customer receivables in addition financial difficulties experienced by our retailers and oem customers have resulted and could result in the future in significant bad debt writeoffs and additions to reserves in our receivables and could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

  

if we do not correctly anticipate demand for our products we may not be able to secure sufficient quantities or costeffective production of our products or we could have costly excess production or inventories 

  

we have generally been able to increase or decrease production to meet fluctuations in demand however the demand for our products depends on many factors and may be difficult to forecast we expect that it will become more difficult to forecast demand as we introduce and support a diverse product portfolio competition in the market for our products intensifies and the markets for some of our products mature significant unanticipated fluctuations in demand could cause the following problems in our operations 

  

• if demand increases beyond what we forecast we would have to rapidly increase production we would depend on suppliers to provide additional volumes of components and those suppliers might not be able to increase production rapidly enough due to supply chain issues or other constraints to meet unexpected demand 

• rapid increases in production levels to meet unanticipated demand could result in higher costs for manufacturing and supply of components higher freight costs associated with urgent distribution of the products and other expenses these higher costs could lower our profit margins further if production is increased rapidly manufacturing quality could decline which may also lower our margins and reduce customer satisfaction 

• if forecasted demand does not develop we could have excess inventories of finished products and components which would use cash and could lead to writeoffs of some or all of the excess inventories lower than forecasted demand could also result in excess manufacturing capacity or reduced manufacturing efficiencies at our facilities which could result in lower margins 

  

gross margins for our products may fluctuate or erode 

  

gross margins in some of our segments are volatile and could decline in the future due to competitive price reductions that are not fully offset by material cost reductions in addition our overall gross margin may fluctuate from period to period due to a number of other factors including product mix foreign exchange rates freight and component costs manufacturing facility utilization and unit volumes in particular the average selling prices of a specific product tend to decrease over that product’s life to offset such decreases we intend to rely primarily on component cost reduction obtaining yield improvements and corresponding cost reductions in the manufacturing of existing products and on introducing new products that incorporate advanced features and therefore can be sold at higher average selling prices however there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain any such yield improvements or cost reductions or introduce any such new products in the future to the extent that such cost reductions and new product introductions do not occur in a timely manner or our products do not achieve market acceptance our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

  

our intellectual property rights are important to our operations and we could suffer loss if they infringe upon others’ rights or are infringed upon by others 

  

we rely on a combination of patents copyrights trademarks and trade secrets confidentiality provisions and licensing arrangements to establish and protect our proprietary rights to this end we hold rights to a number of patents and registered trademarks and regularly file applications to attempt to protect our rights in new technology and trademarks however there is no guarantee that our patent applications will become issued patents or that our trademark applications will become registered trademarks in addition effective copyright patent and trade secret protection may be unavailable limited or not applied for in certain countries moreover even if approved our patents or trademarks may thereafter be successfully challenged by others or otherwise become invalidated for a variety of reasons thus any patents or trademarks we currently have or may later acquire may not provide us a significant competitive advantage 

  

the value of our products relies substantially on our technical innovation in fields in which there are many patent filings third parties may claim that we or our customers some of whom are indemnified by us are infringing their intellectual property rights for example individuals and groups may purchase intellectual property assets for the purpose of asserting claims of infringement and attempting to extract settlements from us or our customers the number of these claims has increased in recent years and may continue to increase in the future such claims could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition from time to time we receive letters alleging infringement of patents trademarks or other intellectual property rights and we have been and currently are a defendant in lawsuits alleging patent infringement litigation concerning patents or other intellectual property is costly and time consuming we may seek licenses from such parties but they could refuse to grant us a license or demand commercially unreasonable terms such infringement claims could also cause us to incur substantial liabilities and to suspend or permanently cease the use of critical technologies or processes or the production or sale of major products 

  

we may become subject to significant product liability costs 

  

if our products malfunction or contain errors or defects we could be subject to significant liability for personal injury and property damage and under certain circumstances could be subject to a judgment for punitive damages we maintain insurance against accidentrelated risks involving our products however there can be no assurance that such insurance would be sufficient to cover the cost of damages to others or that such insurance will continue to be available at commercially reasonable rates in addition insurance coverage may not cover awards of punitive damages and may not cover the cost of associated legal fees and defense costs which could result in lower margins if we are unable to maintain sufficient insurance to cover product liability costs or if our insurance coverage does not cover the award this could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

we have claims and lawsuits against us that may result in adverse outcomes 

we are subject to a variety of claims and lawsuits adverse outcomes in some or all of these claims may result in significant monetary damages or injunctive relief that could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business litigation and other claims are subject to inherent uncertainties and the outcomes can be difficult to predict management may not adequately reserve for a contingent liability or we may suffer unforeseen liabilities which could then impact the results of a financial period a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements could occur for the period in which the effect of an unfavorable final outcome becomes probable and reasonably estimable and could harm our results of operations and financial condition 

  

the longterm effects of the united kingdom’s withdrawal from the european union “brexit” are not yet known and the uncertainty creates challenges and risks which could have a material effect on our business and results of operations 

  

the united kingdom uk formally left the european union eu on january 31 2020 as a result the uk is no longer part of the european single market and european union customs union effective january 1 2021 the euuk trade and cooperation agreement tca became effective on may 1 2021 under the tca there is no longer free movement of goods or people between the uk and the eu which has resulted and could continue to result in certain delays in the shipment of goods from the uk to the eu the longterm risks of brexit include economic recessions in the uk or other european markets and currency instability for both the british pound sterling and the euro 

  

we have operations in the uk including offices and a distribution facility and in several eu member states brexit therefore has impacted and will continue to impact our operations while these impacts have not yet been material to our business operations results of operations and financial condition risks such as slow or inefficient border clearance prolonged economic recession and currency fluctuations could have material adverse effects in the future 

  

our products may contain undetected security vulnerabilities which could result in damage to our reputation lost revenue diverted development resources and increased warranty claims and litigation 

  

undiscovered vulnerabilities in our products could expose them to hackers or other unscrupulous third parties who develop and deploy viruses and other malicious software programs that could attack our products actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products could harm our reputation and lead some customers to return products to reduce or delay future purchases or use competing products 

  

as a business that operates worldwide we are subject to complex and changing global laws and regulations which exposes the company to potential liabilities increased costs and other adverse effects on our business 

  

our global operations are subject to complex and changing laws and regulations including those in the following areas telecommunications environmental health and safety labor and employment antitrust data privacy and security consumer protection product liability anticorruption import export and trade foreign exchange controls anti–money laundering and tax 

  

compliance with these laws and regulations is onerous and expensive increasing the cost of conducting our global operations we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable global laws and regulations but there can be no assurance that at all times we will be in compliance with all global regulations given their multitude complexity and everchanging nature if we are found to have violated laws and regulations it could materially adversely affect our business reputation results of operations and financial condition 

  

our business is subject to a variety of united states and international laws regulations and other legal obligations regarding data protection 

  

we collect store process and use personal information and other user data our users’ personal information may include among other information names addresses phone numbers email addresses payment account information height weight age gender heart rates sleeping patterns gpsbased location and activity patterns 

  

regulatory authorities and legislative bodies around the world including in the united states have enacted or are considering enacting a number of legislative and regulatory proposals concerning data protection these laws continue to develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction complying with these various laws could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business noncompliance could result in significant penalties governmental investigations and regulatory proceedings litigation harm to our brand and a decrease in the use of our products and services many of these laws provide for significant penalties under the general data protection regulation in the european union for example potential penalties can be as high as 4 of a company’s total global revenue 

  

some of our products are subject to governmental regulation or certification failure to obtain required certifications of our products on a timely basis either due to government shutdown or other delays in the certification process could harm our business 

  

federal aviation administration faa certification is required for all of our aviation products that are intended for installation in typecertificated aircraft to the extent required certification is an expensive and timeconsuming process that requires significant focus and resources an inability to obtain or excessive delay in obtaining such certifications could have an adverse effect on our ability to introduce new products and for certain aviation oem products our customers’ ability to sell airplanes delays in our obtaining certification for our aviation products have resulted and may in the future result in our being required to pay compensation to our customers additionally failure of the united states congress to appropriate funds for faa operations that results in a shutdown of faa operations or furloughing of faa employees due to partial or complete government shutdowns or otherwise could result in delays in the required faa certification of our avionics products and in the production sale and registration of aircraft that use our avionics products therefore such inabilities or delays could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results in addition we cannot assure that our certified products will not be decertified any such decertification could have an adverse effect on our operating results 

  

in addition in accordance with fcc rules and regulations wireless transceiver products are required to be certified by the fcc in the united states and comparable authorities in foreign countries where they are sold garmin’s products sold in europe are required to comply with relevant directives of the european commission a delay in receiving required certifications for new products or enhancements to garmin’s products or losing certification for garmin’s existing products could adversely affect our business 

  

changes in our united states federal income tax classification or that of our subsidiaries could result in adverse tax consequences to our 10 or greater us shareholders 

  

the tax cuts and jobs act the “2017 act” signed on december 22 2017 may have changed the consequences to us shareholders that own or are considered to own as a result of the attribution rules ten percent or more of the voting power or value of the stock of a nonus corporation a 10 us shareholder under the us federal income tax law applicable to owners of us controlled foreign corporations “cfcs” 

  

the 2017 act repealed internal revenue code section 958b4 which unless clarified in future regulations or other guidance may result in classification of certain of the company’s foreign subsidiaries as cfcs with respect to any single 10 us shareholder this may be the result without regard to whether 10 us shareholders together own directly or indirectly more than fifty percent of the voting power or value of the company as was the case under prior rules 

  

additional tax consequences to 10 us shareholders of a cfc may result from other provisions of the 2017 act for example the 2017 act added section 951a which requires a 10 us shareholder of a cfc to include in income its prorata share of the global intangible lowtaxed income gilti of the cfc the 2017 act also eliminated the requirement in section 951a necessitating that a foreign corporation be considered a cfc for an uninterrupted period of at least 30 days in order for a 10 us shareholder to have a current income inclusion 

  

from time to time the company may elect to employ antidilutive measures such as a stock buyback program these measures could inadvertently create additional 10 us shareholders and thus trigger adverse tax consequences for those shareholders as described above we urge shareholders to consult their individual tax advisers for advice regarding the 2017 act revisions to the us federal income tax law applicable to owners of cfcs given the current uncertainty regarding their scope of applicability 

  

natural disasters catastrophic events or climate change could affect our financial results 

  

natural disasters and extreme weather events such as tsunamis typhoons floods wildfires or earthquakes could occur in a region where we have a manufacturing or warehousing facility which would cause disruptions in our business operations or loss of inventory global climate change could also result in certain types of natural disasters occurring more frequently or with more intense effects for descriptions and locations of our principal properties see item 2 “properties” these events could also have an impact on our suppliers and affect our supply chain if our backup and recovery plans are not sufficient to minimize business disruption and if our insurance is not sufficient to recover the costs associated with these types of events our financial results could be adversely affected 

  

climate change can also pose a risk to our business due to evolving regulatory and legislative measures surrounding climate change the us environmental protection agency regulates greenhouse gas emissions under the authority granted to it under the clean air act us congress in addition to other regulatory authorities and legislative bodies around the world could pass further legislation to mandate greenhouse gas emission reduction implement capandtrade programs or promote renewable energy and energy efficiency such measures could influence mobility and transportation trends which could decrease the demand for certain of our products 

  

if climate change has impacts on natural disasters or the regulatory environment as discussed above it could result in a change in demand for certain products in markets that we serve including auto aviation and marine if we fail to adjust our product and service offerings to respond to new opportunities driven by changes in regulation andor consumer preferences it could have an adverse effect on our financial results 

  

because it is uncertain what laws and regulations will be enacted we cannot predict the potential impact of such laws and regulations on our future consolidated financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

  

declines in consumer auto profits could negatively impact the carrying value of the goodwill associated with the reporting unit 

  

revenue and profits of the consumer auto reporting unit declined for a number of years through fiscal 2020 as competing technologies emerged and market saturation occurred for certain key products revenue and profit of the consumer auto reporting unit has since increased but some uncertainty remains regarding the longterm growth and profitability of the reporting unit there is no assurance that we can continue to generate profits from the consumer auto segment and in the future some or all of the goodwill associated with the consumer auto reporting unit could be at risk of impairment 

  

our quarterly operating results are subject to fluctuations and seasonality 

  

our operating results are difficult to predict our future quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly if such operating results decline the price of our stock could decline as we have expanded our operations our operating expenses particularly our research and development and information technology costs have increased as a percentage of our sales in some periods if revenues decrease and we continue to increase operating expenses our operating results would be negatively affected 

  

historically our revenues have been lower in the first quarter of each fiscal year as many of our devices are highly consumeroriented and consumer buying is traditionally lower in this quarter however this can fluctuate based on the timing of new product launches sales of certain of our fitness outdoor marine and auto products tend to be higher in our second fiscal quarter due to increased consumer spending for such products in the spring season sales of many of our consumer products also have been higher in our fourth fiscal quarter due to increased consumer spending patterns on electronic devices during the holiday season 

  

we rely on independent dealers and distributors to sell our products and disruption to these channels would harm our business 

  

because we sell many of our products to independent dealers and distributors we are subject to many risks including risks related to their inventory levels and support for our products in particular our dealers and distributors maintain significant levels of our products in their inventories if dealers and distributors attempt to reduce their levels of inventory or if they do not maintain sufficient levels to meet customer demand our sales could be negatively impacted 

  

many of our dealers and distributors also sell products offered by our competitors if our competitors offer our dealers and distributors more favorable terms those dealers and distributors may deemphasize or decline to carry our products in the future we may not be able to retain or attract a sufficient number of qualified dealers and distributors if we are unable to maintain successful relationships with dealers and distributors or to expand our distribution channels our business will suffer 

  

our large customers may also seek to leverage their position to improve their profitability through increased promotional programs or other measures which could have a negative impact on our gross margin additionally the loss of any large customer could adversely affect our sales and profits see note 2 in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for more information on concentration of credit risk 

  

we may pursue strategic acquisitions investments strategic partnerships or other ventures and our business could be materially harmed if we fail to successfully identify evaluate complete and integrate such transactions 

  

we continually evaluate acquisition opportunities and opportunities to make investments in complementary businesses technologies services or products or to enter into strategic partnerships with parties who can provide access to those assets additional product or services offerings additional distribution or marketing synergies or additional industry expertise we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition investment or strategic partnership candidates or if we do identify suitable candidates in the future we may not be able to complete those transactions on commercially favorable terms or at all 

  

any past or future acquisition could also result in difficulties assimilating acquired employees operations and products and diversion of capital and management’s attention away from other business issues and opportunities integration of acquired companies may result in problems related to integration of technology and inexperienced management teams due diligence performed prior to closing acquisitions may not uncover certain risks or liabilities that could materially impact our business and financial results in addition the key personnel of the acquired company may decide not to work for us we may not successfully integrate business operational and financial activities such as internal controls sarbanesoxley act of 2002 compliance cyber security measures the gdpr and other corporate governance and regulatory matters operations personnel or products related to acquisitions we may make in the future if we fail to successfully integrate such transactions our business could be materially harmed 

  

many of our products rely on the global positioning system and other global satellite navigation systems gnss 

  

the global positioning system gps is a satellitebased navigation and positioning system consisting of a constellation of orbiting satellites the satellites and their ground control and monitoring stations are maintained and operated by the united states department of defense the department of defense does not currently charge users for access to the satellite signals these satellites and their ground support systems are complex electronic systems subject to electronic and mechanical failures and possible sabotage gps satellites have a limited lifespan and are subject to damage by the hostile space environment in which they operate while many of the original satellites deployed by the us have been in operation for more than 20 years the us space force and missile systems center continue to launch new satellites to replace retired and aged satellites 

  

despite ongoing efforts to repair maintain and replace nonoperational satellites if a significant number of satellites were to become inoperable there could be a substantial delay before they are replaced with new satellites a reduction in the number of operating satellites may impair the current utility of gps and the growth of current and additional market opportunities furthermore as gps satellites and ground control segments are being modernized software updates can cause problems we depend on public access to open technical specifications in advance of gps updates 

  

gps is operated by the us government which is committed to maintenance and improvement of gps however if the policy were to change and commercial access to gps was no longer supported by the us government or if user fees were imposed it could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

some of our products also use signals from satellite based augmentation systems sbas that augment gps such as the us wide area augmentation system waas japanese mtsatbased satellite augmentation system msas and quasizenith satellite system qzss and european geostationary navigation overlay service egnos any curtailment of sbas operating capability could result in decreased user capability for many of our aviation products thereby impacting our markets 

  

some of our products also use satellite signals from russia’s glonass egnos’ aviation sol service the european union galileo system and the chinese bds national or european authorities may provide preferential access to signals to companies associated with their markets including our competitors which could harm our competitive position use of nonus gnss signals may also be subject to fcc waiver requirements and to restrictions based upon international trade or geopolitical considerations if we are unable to develop timely and competitive commercial products using these systems or obtain timely and equal access to service signals it could result in lost revenue 

  

our business is subject to disruptions and uncertainties caused by geopolitical instability war or terrorism 

  

acts of war or acts of terrorism could have a material adverse impact on our business operating results and financial condition specifically the threat of terrorism and war and heightened security and military response to this threat or any future acts of terrorism may cause a redeployment of the satellites used in gps or interruptions of the system to the extent that such interruptions have an effect on sales of our products this could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

a shut down of airspace or imposition of restrictions on general aviation would harm our business the shutdown of airspace could cause reduced sales of our general aviation products and delays in the shipment of our products manufactured in our taiwan manufacturing facilities to our global distribution facilities thereby adversely affecting our ability to supply new and existing products to our dealers and distributors 

  

we are dependent on the availability and unimpaired use of allocated bands within the radio frequency spectrum our products may be subject to harmful interference from new or modified spectrum uses 

  

our global positioning system technology is dependent on the use of the standard positioning service sps provided by the us government’s gps satellites gps operates in radio frequency bands that are globally allocated for radio navigation satellite services international allocations of radio frequency are made by the international telecommunications union itu a specialized technical agency of the united nations these allocations are further governed by radio regulations that have treaty status and which may be subject to modification every two to three years by the world radio communication conference each country also has regulatory authority on how each band is used in the united states the fcc and the national telecommunications and information administration ntia share responsibility for radio frequency allocations and spectrum usage regulations 

  

our radar altimeter products for aircraft operate in a radio frequency band just above the cband that has been allocated for 5g mobile wireless systems there is a risk that 5g telecommunication systems operating in the vicinity of airports could cause harmful interference to radar altimeters resulting in inaccurate altimeter readings or complete altimeter failure 

  

this or any other itu or national reallocation of radio frequency spectrum including frequency band segmentation or sharing of spectrum or other modifications of the permitted uses of relevant frequency bands may materially and adversely affect the utility and reliability of our products and could have significant negative impacts on our business and our customers 

  

risks relating to our shares 

the volatility of our stock price could adversely affect investment in our common shares 

  

the market price of our shares has been and may continue to be highly volatile during 2021 the closing price of our shares ranged from a low of 11486 to a high of 17838 a variety of factors could cause the price of our shares to fluctuate perhaps substantially including 

  

• new products or product enhancements by us or our competitors 

• general conditions in the worldwide economy including fluctuations in interest rates and global currency exchange rates 

• announcements of technological innovations 

• product obsolescence and our ability to manage product transitions 

• developments in our relationships with our customers and suppliers 

• the availability pricing and timeliness of delivery of components such as flash memory and liquid crystal displays used in our products 

• quarterly fluctuations in our actual or anticipated operating results 

• changes in applicable tax laws and tax rates 

• developments in patents or other intellectual property rights and litigation 

• announcements and rumors of developments related to our business our competitors our suppliers or the markets in which we compete 

• research reports or opinions issued by securities analysts or brokerage houses related to garmin our competitors our suppliers or our customers 

• any significant acts of terrorism against the united states taiwan or significant markets where we sell our products and 

• other factors as discussed in the previously listed risks 

  

in addition in recent years the stock market in general and the markets for shares of technology companies in particular have experienced extreme price fluctuations which have often been unrelated to the operating performance of affected companies any such fluctuations in the future could adversely affect the market price of our common shares 

  

our officers and directors exert substantial influence over us 

  

as of january 24 2022 members of our board of directors and our executive officers together with their respective immediate family members and entities that may be deemed affiliates of or related to such persons or entities beneficially owned approximately 20 of our outstanding shares accordingly these shareholders may be able to determine the outcome of corporate actions requiring shareholder approval such as mergers and acquisitions and shareholder proposals this level of ownership may have a significant effect in delaying deferring or preventing a change in control of garmin and may adversely affect the voting and other rights of other holders of our common shares 

 

the rights of our shareholders are governed by swiss law 

  

the rights of our shareholders are governed by swiss law and garmin ltd’s articles of association the rights of shareholders under swiss law differ from the rights of shareholders of companies incorporated in other jurisdictions for example swiss law allows our shareholders acting at a shareholders’ meeting to authorize share capital that can be issued by the board of directors without approval of a shareholders’ meeting but this authorization is limited to 50 of the existing registered share capital and must be renewed at a shareholders’ meeting at least every two years for it to continue to be available additionally subject to specified exceptions including the exceptions described in our articles of association swiss law grants preemptive rights to existing shareholders to subscribe for new issuances of shares and other securities swiss law also does not provide as much flexibility in the various terms that can attach to different classes of shares as the laws of some other jurisdictions swiss law also reserves for approval by shareholders certain corporate actions over which a board of directors would have authority in some other jurisdictions for example swiss law provides that dividends and other distributions must be approved by shareholders at the general meeting of shareholders these swiss law requirements relating to our capital management may limit our flexibility and situations may arise where greater flexibility would have provided substantial benefits to our shareholders 

  

we have limited capital reserves from which to make distributions without subjecting our shareholders to switzerland withholding tax 

  

as of december 25 2021 we had chf 4800 million of unappropriated capital contribution reserves available from which the company may make dividend payments at the time this reserve balance has been returned to shareholders a swiss federal withholding tax of 35 will generally be applicable to dividends paid 

  

when the capital contribution reserves are fully utilized the swiss federal withholding tax must be withheld from the gross dividend distribution and paid to the swiss federal tax administration a holder that qualifies for benefits under a double tax treaty may be able to recover partial withholding tax for example a us holder that qualifies for benefits under the convention between the united states of america and the swiss confederation for the avoidance of double taxation with respect to taxes on income may apply for a refund of the tax withheld in excess of the 15 treaty rate or in excess of the 5 reduced treaty rate for qualifying corporate shareholders with at least 10 participation in our voting stock or for a full refund in case of qualified pension funds however there can be no assurance that our shareholders will approve a dividend out of capital contribution reserves or that swiss withholding rules will not be changed in the future or that a change in swiss law will not adversely affect us or our shareholders in particular as a result of distributions out of capital contribution reserves becoming subject to additional corporate law or other restrictions if we are unable to pay a dividend out of capital contribution reserves we will not be able to make distributions without subjecting our shareholders to swiss withholding taxes 

  

there is uncertainty as to our shareholders’ ability to enforce certain foreign civil liabilities in switzerland and taiwan 

  

we are a swiss company and a substantial portion of our assets are located outside the united states particularly in taiwan as a result it may be difficult to effect service of process within the united states upon us in addition there is uncertainty as to whether the courts of switzerland or taiwan would recognize or enforce judgments of united states courts obtained against us predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the united states or any state thereof or be competent to hear original actions brought in switzerland or taiwan against us predicated upon the securities laws of the united states or any state thereof

overview 

the company is a leading worldwide provider of wireless devices many of which feature global positioning system gps navigation and applications that are designed for people who live an active lifestyle we are organized in the six operating segments of fitness outdoor aviation marine consumer auto and auto oem the company’s chief executive officer who has been identified as the chief operating decision maker codm allocates resources and assesses performance of each operating segment individually the fitness outdoor aviation and marine operating segments represent reportable segments the consumer auto and auto oem operating segments which serve the auto market do not meet the quantitative thresholds to separately qualify as reportable segments and they are therefore reported together in an “all other” category captioned as auto fitness outdoor aviation marine and auto are collectively referred to as our reported segments 

the operating segments offer products through our network of subsidiary distributors and independent dealers and distributors our own webshop as well as through various aviation marine and auto oems each of the operating segments is managed separately 

  

business environment update 

  

the covid19 pandemic has created disruption and uncertainty in the global economy and has affected our business suppliers and customers the pandemic had an unfavorable impact on net sales and profitability of our aviation and auto segments during 2020 however aviation net sales and profitability trended positively during 2021 while auto net sales have also rebounded we believe net sales and profitability of our fitness outdoor and marine segments benefited from a shift in consumer behavior and demand toward the products these segments offer while these trends generally continued during 2021 certain consumer behaviors have shifted and others may shift as people return to prepandemic lifestyles 

  

our global supply chain is routinely subject to component shortages increased lead times cost fluctuations and logistics constraints these factors have been further amplified by the pandemic which adversely impacted our financial results in 2021 and we expect these supply chain challenges to continue throughout 2022 

  

the current business environment may evolve in ways that could impact our operations and financial results further the nature and degree of the effects of the pandemic and supply chain challenges over time remains uncertain refer to part i item 1a “risk factors” of this annual report for further discussion of the risks and uncertainties facing our company 

  

critical accounting estimates 

general 

our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company’s consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the presentation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including those related to customer sales programs and incentives product returns bad debts inventories investments intangible assets income taxes warranty obligations and contingencies and litigation we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions refer to note 2 in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for our significant accounting policies related to our critical accounting estimates 

  

goodwill 

  

we allocate goodwill to reporting units in proportion to the expected benefit from each business combination each of the company’s operating segments fitness outdoor aviation marine consumer auto and auto oem represents a distinct reporting unit goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value these events or circumstances could include a significant change in the operating performance indicators competition or expectations about future market or economic conditions 

  

application of the goodwill impairment test requires significant judgment including the identification of reporting units assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units assignment of goodwill to reporting units and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit the fair value of each reporting unit is estimated through the use of a discounted cash flow methodology this analysis requires significant assumptions including discount rate projected future revenues projected future operating margins and terminal growth rates the estimates used to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit change from year to year based on operating results market conditions and other factors changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and goodwill impairment for each reporting unit 

unrecognized income tax benefits 

  

we recognize liabilities associated with uncertain income tax positions including those related to transfer pricing based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes will be due we recognize the tax benefits from an uncertain tax position only if payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be not required or it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are measured based on the largest amount of benefit that is more likely than not to be realized upon ultimate settlement 

  

assessing uncertain tax positions requires significant judgment including the evaluation of unique facts and circumstances and the interpretation of laws and regulations especially the assessment of pricing analyses that may produce various ranges of outcomes variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our consolidated financial statements 

  

accounting terms and characteristics 

  

net sales 

  

our net sales are primarily generated through sales to our retail partners dealer and distributor network our own webshop and to original equipment manufacturers oems refer to the revenue recognition discussion in note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements we aim to achieve a quick turnaround on orders we receive from our retail dealer and distributor customers certain arrangements with oem customers are entered into at the beginning of an aircraft boat or vehicle life cycle with the intent to fulfill customer purchasing requirements for the entire production life although there are generally no firm volume commitments and sales are therefore generated on an orderbyorder basis as a result we do not believe backlog information is material to the understanding of our business 

  

net sales are subject to seasonal fluctuation typically sales of our consumer products are highest in the fourth quarter due to increased demand during the holiday buying season and in the second quarter due to increased demand during the spring and summer season our aviation and auto oem products do not experience much seasonal variation but are more influenced by the timing of aircraft certifications regulatory mandates auto program manufacturing and the release of new products when the initial demand is typically the strongest 

  

cost of salesgross profit 

  

raw material costs are our most significant component of cost of goods sold our existing practice of performing the design and manufacture of our products inhouse has enabled us to source components from different suppliers and where possible to redesign our products to leverage lowercost or more readily available components 

  

we believe that our flexible production model allows our factories to experience relatively low costs of manufacturing in general products manufactured in taiwan have been our highest volume products our manufacturing labor costs historically have been lower in taiwan and china than in other locations 

  

shipping and handling costs associated with the transportation and delivery of our products are included in cost of goods sold such costs fluctuate due to a number of factors including market pricing and the mix of modes of transportation we utilize 

  

sales price variability including that which is associated with foreign currency fluctuations has had and can be expected to have an effect on our gross profit our gross profit is dependent on segment mix and to a lesser extent product mix within each segment 

  

advertising expense 

  

our advertising expenses consist primarily of costs for media advertising cooperative advertising with our retail partners point of sale displays and sponsorships 

  

selling general and administrative expenses 

  

our selling general and administrative expenses consist primarily of 

  

• information systems and infrastructure costs 

• salaries for sales marketing and product support personnel 

• salaries and related costs for executives and administrative personnel 

• marketing and other brand building costs 

• finance and legal costs 

• human resource costs 

• travel and related costs and 

• occupancy and other overhead costs 

  

research and development 

  

the majority of our research and development costs represent engineering personnel costs costs of test equipment and components used in product and prototype development and outside product development costs 

  

we are committed to increasing the level of innovative design and development of new products as we strive for expanded ability to serve our existing consumer and aviation markets as well as new auto oem programs and new markets for active lifestyle products 

  

income taxes 

we have experienced a relatively low effective income tax rate due to the proportion of our income generated by entities in tax jurisdictions with relatively low statutory rates 

  

results of operations 

  

the following table sets forth our results of operations as a percentage of net sales during the periods shown the table may not foot due to rounding 

  

   

the table below sets forth our results of operations through operating income for each of our five reported segments and supplemental information for the consumer auto and auto oem operating segments that management believes is useful the company’s codm uses operating income as the measure of profit or loss combined with other measures to assess segment performance and allocate resources operating income represents net sales less costs of goods sold and operating expenses net sales are directly attributed to each segment most costs of goods sold and the majority of operating expenses are also directly attributed to each segment while certain other costs of goods sold and operating expenses are allocated to the segments in a reasonable manner considering the specific facts and circumstances of the expenses being allocated for each line item in the table below the total of the reported segments’ amounts equals the amount in the consolidated statements of income 

  

   

net sales 

  

   

net sales increased 19 in fiscal year 2021 when compared to the yearago period total unit sales increased approximately 8 to 166 million units in 2021 from 154 million units in 2020 which was a smaller increase than that of revenue primarily due to shifts in segment and product mix fitness revenue represented the largest portion of our revenue mix in 2021 at 31 consistent with 31 in 2020 

  

the increase in fitness revenue was primarily driven by growth in cycling and advanced wearables products although the growth trend in cycling slowed throughout 2021 as market trends normalized from pandemic driven levels which is expected to continue in fiscal 2022 outdoor revenue increased due to sales growth across multiple product categories primarily led by adventure watches the aviation revenue increase was primarily driven by growth in oem marine revenue increased due to growth across all categories led by strong demand for our chartplotters auto revenue increased primarily due to sales growth in auto oem programs and consumer auto specialty product categories 

gross profit 

  

   

gross profit dollars in fiscal year 2021 increased 16 primarily due to the increase in net sales compared to the yearago period as described above consolidated gross margin decreased 130 basis points when compared to the yearago period primarily due to higher freight costs 

  

gross margin remained relatively flat within the fitness outdoor and aviation segments higher freight costs in the fitness and outdoor segments were mostly offset by favorable product mix while the marine and consumer auto gross margin decreases of 180 basis points and 340 basis points respectively were primarily attributable to higher freight costs the auto oem gross margin decrease of 730 basis points was primarily attributable to product mix associated with growth in certain auto oem programs this auto oem product mix and associated lower gross margin trend is generally expected to continue into 2022 and beyond 

advertising expenses 

  

   

advertising expense increased 14 in absolute dollars and decreased slightly as a percent of revenue in fiscal year 2021 compared to fiscal year 2020 the total absolute dollar increase was primarily attributable to increased media and cooperative spend 

selling general and administrative expenses 

  

   

selling general and administrative expense increased 16 in absolute dollars and decreased slightly as a percent of revenue when compared to the prior year the absolute dollar increase was primarily attributable to personnel related expenses and information technology costs 

  

research and development expense 

  

   

research and development expense increased 19 in absolute dollars and was flat as a percent of revenue when compared to the yearago period the absolute dollar increase was primarily due to higher engineering personnel costs across all of our operating segments which are expected to continue to increase for all segments in fiscal year 2022 the auto increase in absolute dollars and as a percent of revenue was primarily attributable to higher engineering personnel costs driven by ongoing investments in auto oem programs and a lower proportion of such costs being contractually reimbursable 

  

operating income 

  

   

total operating income increased 16 in absolute dollars and decreased slightly as a percent of revenue when compared to fiscal year 2020 the growth in total operating income on an absolute dollar basis was the result of revenue growth as discussed above auto oem experienced an operating loss in fiscal year 2021 and we expect this trend to continue in 2022 primarily due to relatively lower gross margins and higher expenses associated with certain programs as described above 

other income expense 

  

   

the average interest rate returns on cash and investments during the 52weeks ended december 25 2021 and december 26 2020 were 10 and 14 respectively interest income decreased primarily due to lower yields on fixedincome securities 

  

foreign currency gains and losses for the company are typically driven by movements of a number of currencies in relation to the us dollar the taiwan dollar is the functional currency of garmin corporation the euro is the functional currency of several subsidiaries and the us dollar is the functional currency of garmin europe ltd although some transactions and balances are denominated in british pounds other notable currency exposures include the australian dollar chinese yuan japanese yen polish zloty and swiss franc the majority of the company’s consolidated foreign currency gain or loss is typically driven by the significant cash and marketable securities receivables and payables held in a currency other than the functional currency at a given legal entity 

  

the 453 million currency loss recognized in fiscal 2021 was primarily due to the us dollar strengthening against the euro polish zloty japanese yen swiss franc and australian dollar while the us dollar weakened against the taiwan dollar during fiscal 2021 the us dollar strengthened 73 against the euro 96 against the polish zloty 96 against the japanese yen 30 against the swiss franc and 47 against the australian dollar resulting in losses of 200 million 66 million 26 million 25 million and 24 million respectively while the us dollar weakened 16 against the taiwan dollar resulting in a loss of 62 million the remaining net currency loss of 50 million was related to the impacts of other currencies each of which was individually immaterial 

  

the 28 million currency gain recognized in fiscal 2020 was primarily due to the us dollar weakening against the euro australian dollar chinese yuan and british pound sterling partially offset by the us dollar weakening against the taiwan dollar during fiscal 2020 the us dollar weakened 92 against the euro 94 against the australian dollar 72 against the chinese yuan and 36 against the british pound sterling resulting in gains of 211 million 65 million 29 million and 26 million respectively while the us dollar weakened 71 against the taiwan dollar resulting in a loss of 322 million the remaining net currency gain of 19 million was related to the impacts of other currencies each of which was individually immaterial 

  

income tax provision 

  

income tax expense for the fiscal year ended december 25 2021 was 1246 million compared to income tax expense of 1111 million for the fiscal year ended december 26 2020 representing a net increase of 135 million contributing to the yearoveryear increase in income tax expense in fiscal year 2021 was an increase in income before taxes in the fiscal year ended december 25 2021 compared to the fiscal year ended december 26 2020 

  

certain switzerland tax assets related to the october 2019 enactment of switzerland federal and schaffhausen cantonal tax reform and related transitional measures were revalued in the fourth quarter of 2020 resulting in 110 million income tax expense in connection with these transitional measures included in switzerland tax reform a reduced income tax rate will be utilized on certain switzerland taxable income for up to five years the company also recognized a 143 million income tax benefit in fiscal 2020 due to the release of uncertain tax position reserves associated with a 2014 intercompany restructuring excluding the aforementioned 110 million income tax expense and 143 million income tax benefit in fiscal 2020 income tax expense for fiscal year 2020 was 1144 million 

  

in february 2020 the company initiated a transaction between whollyowned subsidiaries to migrate ownership of certain intellectual property from switzerland to the united states the primary location of research development and executive management the migration which includes a multiyear intercompany license of intellectual property has resulted in a favorable shift of income mix by jurisdiction and a reduction in expense related to uncertain tax positions the company is pursuing an advance pricing agreement between relevant jurisdictions related to this transaction at the end of the license agreement a higher percentage of income will be recognized in the united states 

  

net income 

  

as a result of the various factors noted above net income increased 9 to 10822 million from 9923 million in the prior year 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

  

as of december 25 2021 we had approximately 31 billion of cash cash equivalents and marketable securities we primarily use cash flow from operations and expect that future cash requirements may be used to fund our capital expenditures support our working capital requirements pay dividends and fund strategic acquisitions we believe that our existing cash balances and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our short and longterm projected working capital needs capital expenditures and other cash requirements 

  

it is management’s goal to invest the onhand cash in accordance with the investment policy which has been approved by the company’s board of directors the investment policy’s primary purpose is to preserve capital maintain an acceptable degree of liquidity and maximize yield within the constraint of low credit risk garmin’s average interest rate returns on cash and investments during fiscal 2021 and 2020 were 10 and 14 respectively the fair value of our securities varies from period to period due to changes in interest rates in the performance of the underlying collateral and in the credit performance of the underlying issuer among other factors see note 8 for additional information regarding marketable securities 

cash flows 

  

cash provided by operating activities totaled 10124 million for fiscal 2021 compared to 11353 million for fiscal 2020 the decrease was primarily due to higher purchases of inventory associated with the companys strategy to increase days of supply to support our increasingly diversified product lines this was partially offset by higher net income and improved collections of accounts receivable in fiscal 2021 the company also paid less cash for income taxes in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 although cash paid for income taxes is expected to increase in 2022 associated with the effective date of a provision in the us 2017 tax cuts and jobs act that will require the amortization of deductions for rd expense to be recognized over five or fifteen years within us tax returns rather than immediately expensing such expense as was previously allowed 

  

cash used in investing activities totaled 4754 million for fiscal 2021 compared to 2605 million for fiscal 2020 this increase was primarily due to higher net purchases of marketable securities in fiscal 2021 as the companys balance of cash available for investment grew during the year capital expenditures were also higher in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 as the company invested more heavily in platforms for growth—a trend that is expected to continue in fiscal 2022 these increases were partially offset by lower net cash paid for acquisitions in fiscal 2021 

  

cash used in financing activities totaled 4867 million for fiscal 2021 compared to 4618 for fiscal 2020 this increase was primarily due to higher cash dividend payments in fiscal 2021 as our declared dividend increased from 061 per share for the four calendar quarters beginning in june 2020 to 067 per share for the four calendar quarters beginning in june 2021 

use of cash 

operating leases 

the company has lease arrangements for certain real estate properties vehicles and equipment leased properties are typically used for office space distribution and retail as of december 25 2021 the company had fixed lease payment obligations of 995 million with 233 million payable within 12 months

other purchase obligations 

  

the company’s other purchase obligations primarily consist of noncancelable commitments for capital expenditures and other indirect purchases in connection with conducting our business as of december 25 2021 the company had other purchase obligations of 4216 million with 1854 million payable within 12 months 

  




 item 7aquantitative and qualitat ive disclosures about market risk 

market sensitivity 

  

we have market risk primarily in connection with the pricing of our products and services the purchase of raw materials and the cost of shipping and handling we strive to offset pricing declines for certain products through obtaining reductions in raw materials costs and the introduction of new products 

  

inflation 

  

our business has at times been impacted by increasing costs if our costs were to become subject to significant inflationary pressures we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs through price increases our inability or failure to do so could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

  

the operation of garmin’s subsidiaries in international markets results in exposure to movements in currency exchange rates we have experienced significant foreign currency gains and losses due to the strengthening and weakening of the us dollar the potential of volatile foreign exchange rate fluctuations in the future could have a significant effect on our results of operations the company has not historically hedged its foreign currency exchange rate risks 

 

the currencies that have historically created a majority of the company’s exchange rate exposure are the taiwan dollar and euro garmin corporation headquartered in xizhi taiwan uses the local currency as the functional currency the company translates all assets and liabilities at year ‐ end exchange rates and income and expense accounts at average rates during the year in order to minimize the effect of the currency exchange fluctuations on our net assets we have elected to retain most of our taiwan subsidiary’s cash and investments denominated in us dollars 

  

most european subsidiaries use the euro as the functional currency the functional currency of our largest european subsidiary garmin europe ltd is the us dollar and as some transactions occur in british pounds sterling or euros foreign currency gains or losses have been realized historically related to the movements of those currencies relative to the us dollar 

  

during fiscal year 2021 the company incurred a net foreign currency loss of 453 million the us dollar strengthened against the euro polish zloty japanese yen swiss franc and australian dollar while the us dollar weakened against the taiwan dollar during fiscal 2021 the us dollar strengthened 73 against the euro 96 against the polish zloty 96 against the japanese yen 30 against the swiss franc and 47 against the australian dollar resulting in losses of 200 million 66 million 26 million 25 million and 24 million respectively while the us dollar weakened 16 against the taiwan dollar resulting in a loss of 62 million the remaining net currency loss of 50 million was related to the impacts of other currencies each of which was individually immaterial these and other currency moves during fiscal year 2021 also resulted in a currency translation adjustment of 395 million within accumulated other comprehensive income 

  

we assessed the company’s exposure to movements in currency exchange rates by performing a sensitivity analysis of adverse changes in exchange rates and the corresponding impact to our results of operations based on monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than respective functional currencies as of december 25 2021 hypothetical and reasonably possible adverse changes of 10 for the taiwan dollar euro polish zloty japanese yen swiss franc and australian dollar would have resulted in an adverse impact on income before income taxes of approximately 68 million based on monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than respective functional currencies as of december 26 2020 hypothetical and reasonably possible adverse changes of 10 for the taiwan dollar euro and british pound sterling would have resulted in an adverse impact on income before income taxes of approximately 84 million 

interest rate risk 

  

we have no outstanding longterm debt as of december 25 2021 we therefore have no meaningful debtrelated interest rate risk 

  

we are exposed to interest rate risk in connection with our investments in marketable securities as interest rates change the unrealized gains and losses associated with those securities will fluctuate accordingly 

  

the company’s investment policy targets low risk investments with the objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss the company does not intend to sell securities in an unrealized loss position and it is not more likely than not that the company will be required to sell such investments before recovery of their amortized costs bases which may be maturity as of december 25 2021 and december 26 2020 the company had not recognized an allowance for credit losses on any securities in an unrealized loss position 

  

we assessed the company’s exposure to interest rate risk by performing a sensitivity analysis of a parallel shift in the yield curve and the corresponding impact to the company’s portfolio of marketable securities based on balance sheet positions as of december 25 2021 and december 26 2020 the hypothetical and reasonably possible 100 basis point increases in interest rates across all securities would have resulted in declines in portfolio fair market value of approximately 40 million and 34 million at december 25 2021 and december 26 2020 respectively such losses would only be realized if the company sold the investments prior to maturity

research and development

 

garmin’s product innovations are driven by its strong emphasis on research and development and the close partnership between garmin’s engineering and manufacturing teams garmin’s products are created by its engineering and development staff garmin’s manufacturing staff includes manufacturing process engineers who work closely with garmin’s design engineers to ensure manufacturability and manufacturing cost control for its products garmin’s development staff includes industrial designers as well as software engineers electrical engineers mechanical engineers and cartographic engineers garmin believes the industrial design of its products has played an important role in garmin’s success

 

manufacturing and operations 

 

garmin believes one of its core competencies and strengths is its vertically integrated manufacturing capabilities at its taiwan facilities in xizhi jhongli and linkou its china facility in yangzhou its netherlands facility in oegstgeest its poland facility in wroclaw and at its us facilities in olathe kansas and salem oregon garmin believes that its ownership and operation of its own manufacturing facilities and distribution networks provides significant capability and flexibility to address the breadth and depth of resources necessary to serve its diverse products and markets

 

specifically garmin believes that its vertical integration of its manufacturing capabilities provides advantages to product cost quality and time to market 

 

cost garmin’s manufacturing resources rapidly and iteratively prototype designs concepts products and processes achieving higher efficiency resulting in lower cost garmin’s vertical integration approach enables leveraging of manufacturing resources across high mid and low volume products sharing of these resources across product lines favorably affects garmin’s costs to produce its range of products with lower volume products realizing the economies of scale of higher volume products the ownership and integration of its resources allows garmin to optimize the design for manufacturing of its products yielding improved cost 

 

quality garmin’s automation and advanced production processes provide inservice robustness and consistent reliability standards that enable garmin to maintain strict process and quality control of the products manufactured thereby improving the overall quality of our products additionally the immediate feedback throughout the manufacturing processes is provided to the development teams providing integrated continuous improvement throughout design and supply chain 

 

time to market garmin uses multidisciplinary teams of design engineers process engineers and supply chain specialists to develop products allowing them to quickly move from concept to manufacturing this integrated ownership provides inherent flexibility to enable faster time to market 

 

garmin’s design manufacturing distribution and service functions in its us taiwan china and uk facilities are certified to iso 9001 an international quality standard developed by the international organization for standardization garmin’s automotive operations in taiwan china uk and olathe have achieved iatf 16949 certification a quality standard for automotive suppliers garmin’s olathe and salem aviation operations have achieved certification to as9100 the quality standard for the aviation industry 

 

garmin international inc garmin europe ltd and garmin corporation have also achieved certification of their environmental management systems to the iso 14001 standard recognizing garmin’s systems and processes which minimize or prevent harmful effects on the environment and continually strive to improve its environmental performance

 

materials

 

although most components essential to garmin’s business are generally available from multiple sources certain key components are currently obtained by the company from single or limited sources which subjects garmin to supply and pricing risks many of these and other key components that are available from multiple sources including but not limited to nand flash memory dynamic random access memory dram gps chipsets and certain lcds are subject at times to industrywide shortages and commodity pricing fluctuations 

 

garmin and other participants in the personal computer tablet mobile communication automotive aviation electronics and consumer electronics industries also compete for various components with other industries that have experienced increased demand for their products in addition garmin uses some custom components that are not common to the rest of the personal computer tablet mobile communication and consumer electronics industries new products introduced by the company often utilize custom components available from only one source until garmin has evaluated whether there is a need for and subsequently qualifies additional suppliers when a component or product uses new technologies initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields have matured or manufacturing capacity has increased garmin makes efforts to manage risks in these areas through the use of supply agreements and safety stock for strategically important components 

 

seasonality

 

our net sales are subject to seasonal fluctuation sales of our consumer products are generally higher in the fourth quarter due to increased demand during the holiday buying season and to a lesser extent the second quarter due to increased demand during the spring and summer season sales of consumer products are also influenced by the timing of the release of new products our auto oem and aviation products do not experience much seasonal variation but are more influenced by the timing of auto program manufacturing aircraft certifications regulatory mandates and the release of new products when the initial demand is typically the strongest

 

intellectual property 

 

our success and ability to compete is dependent in part on our proprietary technology we rely on a combination of patent copyright trademark and trade secret laws as well as confidentiality agreements to establish and protect our proprietary rights in addition garmin often relies on licenses of intellectual property for use in its business 

 

as of january 28 2021 garmin has been issued over 1450 patents throughout the world and holds more than 930 trademark registrations the duration of patents varies in accordance with the provisions of applicable local law we believe that our continued success depends on the intellectual skills of our employees and their ability to continue to innovate garmin will continue to file and prosecute patent applications when appropriate to attempt to protect garmin’s rights in its proprietary technologies 

 

there is no assurance that our current patents or patents which we may later acquire may successfully withstand any challenge in whole or in part it is also possible that any patent issued to us may not provide us with any competitive advantages or that the patents of others will preclude us from manufacturing and marketing certain products despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights to protect our trade secrets to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others or to defend against claims of infringement or invalidity

 

regulations 

 

the telecommunications industry is highly regulated and the regulatory environment in which garmin operates is subject to change in accordance with the united states’ federal communications commission fcc rules and regulations wireless transceiver products are required to be certified by the fcc and comparable authorities in foreign countries where they are sold garmin’s products sold in europe are required to comply with relevant directives of the european commission a delay in receiving required certifications for new products or enhancements to garmin’s products or losing certification for garmin’s existing products could adversely affect our business in addition aviation products that are intended for installation in “type certificated aircraft” are required to be certified by the federal aviation administration faa its european counterpart the european aviation safety agency and other comparable organizations before they can be used in an aircraft 

 

because garmin corporation one of the company’s principal subsidiaries is located in taiwan foreign exchange control laws and regulations of taiwan with respect to remittances into and out of taiwan may have an impact on garmin’s operations the taiwan foreign exchange control statute and regulations thereunder provides that all foreign exchange transactions must be executed by banks designated to handle such business by the ministry of finance of taiwan and by the central bank of the republic of china taiwan also referred to as the cbc current regulations favor traderelated foreign exchange transactions consequently foreign currency earned from exports of merchandise and services may now be retained and used freely by exporters while all foreign currency needed for the import of merchandise and services may be purchased freely from the designated foreign exchange banks aside from traderelated foreign exchange transactions taiwan companies and residents may without foreign exchange approval remit outside and into taiwan foreign currencies of up to 50 million and 5 million respectively or their equivalent each calendar year currency conversions within the limits are processed by the designated banks and do not have to be reviewed and approved by the cbc the above limits apply to remittances involving a conversion between taiwan dollars and us dollars or other foreign currencies the cbc typically approves foreign exchange in excess of the limits if a party applies with the cbc for review and presents legitimate business reasons justifying the currency conversion a requirement is also imposed on all enterprises to register all medium and longterm foreign debt with the cbc 

 

environmental matters 

 

garmin’s operations are subject to various environmental laws including laws addressing air and water pollution and management of hazardous substances and wastes substantial noncompliance with applicable environmental laws could have a material adverse effect on our business capital expenditures for environmental controls are included in our normal capital budget historically capital expenditures associated with environmental controls have not been material and compliance with environmental laws has not had a material impact on the company’s competitive position 

 

many of garmins products are subject to laws relating to the chemical and material composition of our products and their energy efficiency garmin is also subject to laws requiring manufacturers to be financially responsible for collection recovery and recycling of wastes from certain electronic products compliance with current environmental laws does not have a material impact on our business but the impact of future enactment of environmental laws cannot yet be fully determined and could be substantial

 

garmin has implemented multiple environmental management system ems policies in accordance with the international organization for standardization iso 14001 standard for environmental health and safety management garmin’s ems policies set forth practices standards and procedures to ensure compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations at garmin’s kansas headquarters facility garmin’s european headquarters facility and garmin’s taiwan and china manufacturing facilities 

 

garmin continues to strive to reduce our carbon footprint by increasing our environmental sustainability efforts our manufacturing locations have implemented increased recycling processes that keep all obsolete garmin manufactured material from entering the waste stream additionally our most recently completed facility in olathe kansas has been constructed with energy efficient considerations including reduced water consumption led lighting and reflective roofing to deflect solar radiation

 

human capital 

 

successful execution of our strategy is dependent on attracting developing and retaining key employees and members of our management team to facilitate talent attraction and retention we strive to provide opportunities for our employees to grow and develop in their careers supported by generous compensation and benefits and through programs that build connections between our employees and their communities 

 

 

as of december 26 2020 the company had approximately 16000 full and parttime employees worldwide of whom approximately 6000 were in the americas region 7800 were in apac and 2200 were in emea garmin’s vertical integration model enables us to provide a variety of opportunities across many different professions including engineering human resources information technology marketing sales and operations the company’s products are created by its engineering and development staff which numbered approximately 4900 people worldwide as of december 26 2020 garmin’s manufacturing staff which numbered approximately 6100 people worldwide as of december 26 2020 includes manufacturing process engineers who work closely with garmin’s design engineers to ensure manufacturability and manufacturing cost control for its products

 

garmin respects the right of all employees to form and join an association to represent their interests as employees to organize and to bargain collectively or individually we also respect any employee’s choice to refrain from joining a union except for some of garmin’s employees in sweden none of garmin’s employees are represented by a labor union and none of garmins north american or taiwan employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement we believe our efforts in managing our workforce have been effective as evidenced by a strong company culture and positive relations between the company and our employees

 

we offer a range of robust benefits to our employees that enable us to attract and retain leading talent in addition to salaries these programs which vary by countryregion include stock awards retirement plans healthcare and insurance benefits health savings and flexible spending accounts paid time off family leave and an employee stock purchase plan which provides employees an opportunity to acquire company ownership for a discounted price we also invest significant resources in our talent development programs to provide employees with the training and education they need to help achieve their career goals build relevant skills and lead their organizations employee resource groups provide opportunities for employees to connect network and become involved in community engagement initiatives 

 

we support local community engagement initiatives where we have a business presence and we provide opportunities for employees to give back to those communities one such initiative is through active engagement in science technology engineering and math “stem” community outreach programs our strategic aim in these educational programs is to educate and encourage local students to pursue careers in the engineering field especially those in underrepresented groups which we believe benefits not only our company but the overall industry

risk factors

tableend

the risks described below are not the only ones facing our company additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also impair our business operations if any of the following risks occur our business financial condition or operating results could be materially adversely affected

risks related to the company

if we are not successful in the continued development timely manufacture and introduction of new products or product categories demand for our products could decrease to the extent that lost sales and profits or losses from declining segments or product categories are not entirely offset 

we expect that a significant portion of our future revenue will continue to be derived from sales of newly introduced products this is particularly important to replace sales and profits lost or losses incurred in declining segments or product categories the market for our products is characterized by rapidly changing technology evolving industry standards and changes in customer needs if we fail to introduce new products or to modify or improve our existing products in response to changes in technology industry standards or customer needs our products could rapidly become less competitive or obsolete we must continue to make significant investments in research and development in order to continue to develop new products enhance existing products and achieve market acceptance for such products however there can be no assurance that development stage products will be successfully completed or if developed will achieve significant customer acceptance 

if we are unable to successfully develop and introduce competitive new products and enhance our existing products our future results of operations would be adversely affected our pursuit of necessary technology may require substantial time and expense we may need to license new technologies to respond to technological change these licenses may not be available to us on terms that we can accept or may materially change the gross profits that we are able to obtain on our products we may not succeed in adapting our products to new technologies as they emerge development and manufacturing schedules for technology products are difficult to predict and there can be no assurance that we will achieve timely initial customer shipments of new products the timely availability of these products in volume and their acceptance by customers are important to our future success any future challenges related to new products whether due to product development delays manufacturing delays lack of market acceptance delays in regulatory approval or otherwise could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

if we are unable to compete effectively with existing or new competitors our resulting loss of competitive position could result in price reductions fewer customer orders reduced margins and loss of market share 

the markets for many of our products are highly competitive and we expect competition to increase in the future some of our competitors have significantly greater financial technical and marketing resources than we do these competitors may be able to respond more rapidly to new or emerging technologies or changes in customer requirements they may also be able to devote greater resources to the development promotion and sale of their products or secure better product positioning with retailers increased competition could result in price reductions fewer customer orders reduced margins and loss of market share our failure to compete successfully against current or future competitors could seriously harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

public health emergencies or outbreaks of epidemics pandemics or contagious diseases have had and will likely continue to have significant impacts on our business

widespread public health emergencies or outbreaks of epidemics pandemics or contagious diseases such as the covid19 pandemic have had and will likely continue to have significant impacts on our business the covid19 pandemic continues to rapidly evolve creating disruption and uncertainty around the world which has resulted in and we expect will continue to result in reduced overall demand for certain of our products and other operational impacts there are unknown factors such as the duration and severity of the pandemic the nature and length of actions taken by governments businesses and individuals to contain or mitigate its impact the severity and duration of the economic impact caused by the pandemic the uncertainty surrounding the efficacy distribution and uptake of vaccines along with the effectiveness of our response that may affect the magnitude of effects to our business operations results of operations and its ultimate impact on our financial condition

demand for certain of our products has been and is expected to continue to be adversely affected in several ways consumers have been and may continue to be less able or less likely to purchase certain of our products due to economic hardships governmental restrictions affecting them and the retail outlets that sell our products voluntary behavior changes associated with public health guidance the prioritization of other goods and services by online retailers that sell our products restrictions on the ability of online retailers to ship products to certain areas the cancellation of trade shows and other events that are otherwise important in the marketing and sale of our products and the potential failure and closure of retail outlets and online retailers that sell our products certain of our sales and distribution offices have experienced and may again experience temporary closure due to governmental restrictions additional or prolonged closures of certain sales and distribution offices could affect our ability to market and distribute products to meet customer demand the adverse impacts of the pandemic have created economic stress in the global marketplace high levels of unemployment loss of income andor wealth for some individuals and general economic uncertainty these conditions have affected and are expected to continue to affect the willingness or ability of customers to purchase certain of our products or those of original equipment manufacturers in which our products are installed

our supply chain may also be adversely impacted by covid19 we may be unable to procure or experience delays in procuring certain components from our suppliers and the cost of procuring components could increase reduced demand for certain of our products has resulted in and may continue to result in reduced utilization of certain of our manufacturing facilities and higher perunit costs for certain products certain of our manufacturing facilities may also experience inopportune temporary closures or reduced hours which could adversely affect the costs incurred to produce our products and our ability to meet demand

covid19 has had and will continue to have several other operational impacts on our business which will or may include employees working remotely temporarily ceasing operations in some offices due to government restrictions business travel restrictions and the cancellation of events that are otherwise important in the development  marketing and sale of our products these changes in our business operations may result in reduced efficiency and lower productivity we have incurred and are expected to continue to incur increased costs as we provide additional benefits to assist our employees during the covid19 pandemic and provide a safe and healthy workplace for employees who continue to work in our facilities similar operational and financial hardships on our business partners may result in aged or uncollectable receivables and the reduced demand for certain of our products could result in obsolescence of certain inventory if the economy experiences a sustained downturn of significant proportion that impacts portions of our business we may also need to incur the costs and organizational impacts of personnel restructuring 

additional risks and impacts associated with covid19 including gross margin fluctuation foreign currency fluctuations successful continued product development impacts to our key personnel and dependencies on third party suppliers may be heightened as a result of the covid19 pandemic there are further unknown risks and impacts due to the uncertainty and rapidly evolving nature of the pandemic including but not limited to uncertainty around the evolution of the pandemic the unprecedented imposition of preventative measures by governments that impact the economy and normal operations of a business and the timing and manner of relaxation of those measures potential future health emergencies may present risks and impacts similar to the ongoing covid19 pandemic if we are unable to manage these risks and uncertainties our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially impacted

maturation or contraction of the market for wearable devices or categories of these devices could adversely affect our revenue and profits

we have experienced growth in sales and profits in our outdoor and fitness segments which in recent years have benefited from increased sales of wearable devices if the overall wearable device market declines or categories of devices within the wearable device market decline significantly our business financial condition or operating results could be materially adversely affected

 

we depend on third party suppliers and licensors some of which are sole source for content technology and components used in our products our production and business would be seriously harmed if these suppliers are not able to meet our demand and alternative sources are not available or if the costs of components rise 

 

we are dependent on third party suppliers for various components used in our current products some of the components that we procure from third party suppliers include semiconductors and electroluminescent panels liquid crystal displays memory chips batteries and microprocessors the cost quality and availability of components are essential to the successful production and sale of our products some components we use are from sole source suppliers certain applicationspecific integrated circuits incorporating our proprietary designs are manufactured for us by sole source suppliers alternative sources may not be currently available for these sole source components 

 

we have and may continue to experience shortages of certain components in addition a shortage in supply of components may result in an increase of the costs of available components if suppliers are unable to meet our demand for components on a timely basis or if we are unable to obtain an alternative source or if the price of the alternative source is prohibitive our ability to maintain timely and costeffective production of our products would be seriously harmed 

 

we are committed to make significant investments in auto oem for the foreseeable future which could negatively impact total company profits and shareholder value if we fail to become profitable 

 

we have been awarded several tierone and tiertwo auto oem supplier contracts to fulfill the associated program commitments we are investing significantly in facilities research and development and other operating expenses and we will continue to do so in the coming years gross margins associated with these auto oem programs are lower than the gross margins realized by the company as a whole in recent periods if we are not successful in winning additional contract awards or substantially leveraging our investments periods of lower operating income or operating losses in the auto oem segment could continue to negatively impact total company profits and may negatively impact shareholder value if we fail to become profitable

 

 

we rely on information technology systems for our business operations failures or disruptions including security breaches or cyber attacks to our information technology systems may harm our reputation and adversely affect our business and result of operations

 

our information technology systems allow for our daily business operations to operate efficiently and effectively these systems assist in our business processes including but not limited to communications financial management supply chain management manufacturing order processing shipping and billing and providing services and support to our customers additionally we electronically maintain sensitive data including our intellectual property and confidential and proprietary information and that of our business partners we also electronically maintain personal information of our users and employees the secure processing maintenance and transmission of this information is important to our operations a disruption to any of these processes can adversely affect our business and results of operations furthermore a breach of our security systems and procedures or those of our vendors could result in significant data losses or theft of our intellectual property or confidential and proprietary information or that of our business partners as well as our users’ or employees personal information 

 

we have technology and processes in place to detect and respond to data security incidents however because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access disable or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently and may be difficult to detect for long periods of time we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventive measures in addition hardware software or applications we develop or procure from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture or other problems that could unexpectedly compromise information security unauthorized parties have also attempted and may in the future attempt to gain access to our systems or facilities through fraud trickery or other forms of deceiving our customers and employees accordingly we have been and may in the future be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate security barriers or other preventative measures or if such measures are implemented and even with appropriate training conducted in support of such measures human errors may still occur it is virtually impossible for us to entirely mitigate this risk a party whether internal or external who is able to circumvent our security measures could misappropriate information

 

actual or anticipated attacks and risks have caused and are expected to continue to cause us to incur increasing costs including costs to deploy additional personnel and protection technologies to conduct additional employee training and to engage third party security experts and consultants 

 

if we fail to reasonably maintain the security of our intellectual property or confidential and proprietary information or that of our business partners or if we fail to reasonably maintain the security of the personal information of our users or employees we may suffer significant reputational and financial losses and our results of operations cash flows financial condition and liquidity may be adversely affected in addition a system breach could result in other negative consequences including disruption of internal operations and loss of functionality of critical systems and online services and may subject us to private litigation government investigations regulatory proceedings enforcement actions and cause us to incur potentially significant liability damages or remediation costs although we maintain cyber insurance coverage that subject to policy terms and conditions and a significant selfinsured retention is designed to address certain aspects of cyber risks such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise in the continually evolving area of cyber risk

 

the company was the victim of a cyber attack that encrypted some of our systems on july 23 2020 as a result many of our online services were interrupted including website functions customer support customer facing applications and company communications we immediately began to assess the nature of the attack and started remediation based on our due diligence and independent forensic analysis we have no indication that any customer data was accessed lost or stolen additionally the functionality of garmin products was not affected other than the ability to access online services the impact of this outage to our operations and financial results was not material and we do not expect it to have material impacts on future periods however we may still suffer negative consequences including certain of those described in the paragraphs above beyond our current expectations  

 

our annual and quarterly financial statements will reflect fluctuations in foreign currency translation

 

the operation of our subsidiaries in global markets results in exposure to movements in currency exchange rates we have experienced significant foreign currency gains and losses due to the strengthening and weakening of the us dollar relative to certain other currencies the potential of volatile foreign exchange rate fluctuations in the future could have a significant effect on our results of operations we have not historically used financial instruments to hedge our foreign currency exchange rate risks

 

 

the currencies that typically create a majority of our exchange rate exposure are the taiwan dollar euro british pound sterling australian dollar chinese yuan and japanese yen the taiwan dollar is the functional currency of garmin corporation the euro is the functional currency of several subsidiaries and the us dollar is the functional currency of garmin europe ltd although some transactions and balances are denominated in british pounds other legal entities primarily use the local currency as the functional currency due to the relative size of entities with other functional currencies fluctuations of other currencies are not expected to have a material impact on our financial statements 

 

we translate income and expense activity at the approximate rate of exchange at the transaction date and all assets and liabilities at the rate of exchange in effect at the balance sheet date income and expense activity in a currency other than the us dollar can be impacted by exchange rate variations over time the majority of our consolidated foreign currency gain or loss is typically driven by exchange rate impacts on the significant cash receivables and payables held in a currency other than the functional currency at a given legal entity such gain or loss will create variations in our earnings per share however because there is minimal cash impact caused by such exchange rate variations management will continue to focus on our operating performance before the impact of foreign currency gains and losses 

 

changes in applicable tax laws or resolutions of tax disputes could result in adverse tax consequences to the company 

 

our tax positions could be adversely impacted by changes to tax laws tax treaties or tax regulations or the interpretation or enforcement thereof by any tax authority in which we file income tax returns particularly in the us switzerland taiwan and uk we cannot predict the outcome of any specific legislative proposals 

 

global taxing standards continue to evolve as a result of the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd recommendations aimed at preventing perceived base erosion and profit shifting beps by multinational corporations while these recommendations do not change tax law the countries where we operate may implement legislation or take unilateral actions which may result in adverse effects to our income tax provision and financial statements partially to respond to recent and continuing changes to global tax standards we initiated an intercompany transaction which migrates ownership of certain consumer products intellectual property from switzerland to the united states which is the primary location of research development and executive management due to the subjectivity inherent in transfer pricing associated with this intercompany transaction we are pursuing an advanced pricing agreement with relevant jurisdictions to provide certainty regarding the pricing however we are unable to predict the outcome of the final advanced pricing agreement and related negotiations which could materially andor adversely impact our income tax provision net income or cash flows for periods during negotiation and upon finalization 

 

significant judgment is required in determining our global provision for income taxes in the ordinary course of our business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain most notably in the area of transfer pricing we are regularly under audit by tax authorities although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals the results of an audit or litigation could have a material effect on our income tax provision net income or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made

 

changes to trade regulations including trade restrictions sanctions or tariffs could significantly harm our results of operations

 

we manufacture goods in the people’s republic of china also referred to as the prc and import certain materials from the prc that are used to manufacture goods in the united states the imposition of additional governmental controls or regulations that create new or enhanced restrictions on free trade trade sanctions or tariffs particularly those applicable to materials or goods from the prc could have a substantial adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition

 

 

economic regulatory and political conditions and uncertainty could adversely affect our revenue and profits

 

our revenue and profits depend significantly on general economic conditions and the demand for products in the markets in which we compete we have operations outside the united states that make up a significant portion of our total revenue which can present challenges depending on economic and geopolitical conditions on both a global and regional scale economic weakness or constrained consumer and business spending has resulted in periods of decreased revenue in the past and could in the future result in decreased revenue and problems with our ability to manage inventory levels and collect customer receivables in addition financial difficulties experienced by our retailers and oem customers have resulted and could result in the future in significant bad debt writeoffs and additions to reserves in our receivables and could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

 

we may experience unique economic and political risks associated with companies that operate in taiwan 

 

our principal manufacturing facilities where we manufacture most of our consumer products are located in taiwan relations between taiwan and the prc and other factors affecting the political or economic conditions of taiwan in the future could materially affect our business financial condition and results of operations and the market price and the liquidity of our shares 

 

the prc asserts sovereignty over all of china including taiwan certain other islands and all of mainland china the prc government does not recognize the legitimacy of the taiwan government although significant economic and cultural relations exist between taiwan and the prc the prc government has indicated that it may use military force to gain control over taiwan in certain circumstances such as the declaration of independence by taiwan the united states relations with taiwan are governed by the 1979 taiwan relations act which signifies when the us switched diplomatic recognition from taiwan to the prc referred to as the onechina policy deviations from the onechina policy could lead to adverse changes in chinaus and chinataiwan relations and could adversely affect our operations in taiwan in the future

 

if we do not correctly anticipate demand for our products we may not be able to secure sufficient quantities or costeffective production of our products or we could have costly excess production or inventories 

 

we have generally been able to increase or decrease production to meet fluctuations in demand however the demand for our products depends on many factors and may be difficult to forecast we expect that it will become more difficult to forecast demand as we introduce and support a diverse product portfolio competition in the market for our products intensifies and the markets for some of our products mature significant unanticipated fluctuations in demand could cause the following problems in our operations 

 







 

 

the effects of the united kingdom’s withdrawal from the european union “brexit” including trade agreements are not yet known and the uncertainty creates challenges and risks which could have a material effect on our business and results of operations

 

the united kingdom uk formally left the european union eu on january 31 2020 and a transition period through december 31 2020 was established to allow the uk and eu to negotiate the terms of the uk’s withdrawal as a result the uk is no longer part of the european single market and european union customs union effective january 1 2021 the uk and eu signed the eu–uk trade and cooperation agreement tca in december 2020 which has been applied provisionally since january 1 2021 until it is ratified by all parties to the agreement under the tca there is no longer the free movement of goods or people between the uk and the eu which has resulted and could continue to result in certain delays in the shipment of these goods the longterm risks of brexit include economic recessions in the uk or other european markets and currency instability for both the british pound sterling and the euro

 

we have operations in the uk including offices and a distribution facility and several eu member states brexit therefore has impacted and will continue to impact our operations while these impacts have not yet been material to our business operations results of operations and financial condition risks such as slow or inefficient border clearance prolonged economic recession and currency fluctuations could have material adverse effects in the future 

 

our intellectual property rights are important to our operations and we could suffer loss if they infringe upon others’ rights or are infringed upon by others 

 

we rely on a combination of patents copyrights trademarks and trade secrets confidentiality provisions and licensing arrangements to establish and protect our proprietary rights to this end we hold rights to a number of patents and registered trademarks and regularly file applications to attempt to protect our rights in new technology and trademarks however there is no guarantee that our patent applications will become issued patents or that our trademark applications will become registered trademarks in addition effective copyright patent and trade secret protection may be unavailable limited or not applied for in certain countries moreover even if approved our patents or trademarks may thereafter be successfully challenged by others or otherwise become invalidated for a variety of reasons thus any patents or trademarks we currently have or may later acquire may not provide us a significant competitive advantage 

 

the value of our products relies substantially on our technical innovation in fields in which there are many patent filings third parties may claim that we or our customers some of whom are indemnified by us are infringing their intellectual property rights for example individuals and groups may purchase intellectual property assets for the purpose of asserting claims of infringement and attempting to extract settlements from us or our customers the number of these claims has increased in recent years and may continue to increase in the future such claims could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition from time to time we receive letters alleging infringement of patents trademarks or other intellectual property rights and we have been and currently are a defendant in lawsuits alleging patent infringement litigation concerning patents or other intellectual property is costly and time consuming we may seek licenses from such parties but they could refuse to grant us a license or demand commercially unreasonable terms such infringement claims could also cause us to incur substantial liabilities and to suspend or permanently cease the use of critical technologies or processes or the production or sale of major products 

we may become subject to significant product liability costs 

 

if our products malfunction or contain errors or defects we could be subject to significant liability for personal injury and property damage and under certain circumstances could be subject to a judgment for punitive damages we maintain insurance against accidentrelated risks involving our products however there can be no assurance that such insurance would be sufficient to cover the cost of damages to others or that such insurance will continue to be available at commercially reasonable rates in addition insurance coverage may not cover awards of punitive damages and may not cover the cost of associated legal fees and defense costs which could result in lower margins if we are unable to maintain sufficient insurance to cover product liability costs or if our insurance coverage does not cover the award this could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we have claims and lawsuits against us that may result in adverse outcomes 

we are subject to a variety of claims and lawsuits adverse outcomes in some or all of these claims may result in significant monetary damages or injunctive relief that could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business litigation and other claims are subject to inherent uncertainties and the outcomes can be difficult to predict management may not adequately reserve for a contingent liability or we may suffer unforeseen liabilities which could then impact the results of a financial period a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements could occur for the period in which the effect of an unfavorable final outcome becomes probable and reasonably estimable and could harm our results of operations and financial condition

 

continued declines in consumer auto revenue could negatively impact the carrying value of the goodwill associated with the reporting unit 

 

we experienced substantial growth through 2008 in our auto segment as pnds became massmarket consumer electronics in both europe and north america the consumer auto market has been declining as competing technologies emerged and market saturation occurred navigation technologies have been incorporated into and become more prevalent in competing devices such as mobile handsets tablets and new automobiles through factoryinstalled systems the acceptance by consumers of these alternative solutions has negatively impacted sales and profits in the consumer auto segment there is no assurance that the decline in sales will end and thus no assurance that we can continue to generate profits from the consumer auto segment which could put some or all of the goodwill associated with the consumer auto reporting unit at further risk of impairment 

 

our products may contain undetected security vulnerabilities which could result in damage to our reputation lost revenue diverted development resources and increased warranty claims and litigation

 

undiscovered vulnerabilities in our products could expose them to hackers or other unscrupulous third parties who develop and deploy viruses and other malicious software programs that could attack our products actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products could harm our reputation and lead some customers to return products to reduce or delay future purchases or use competing products

 

our business is subject to a variety of united states and international laws regulations and other legal obligations regarding data protection 

 

we collect store process and use personal information and other user data our users’ personal information may include among other information names addresses phone numbers email addresses payment account information height weight age gender heart rates sleeping patterns gpsbased location and activity patterns 

 

regulatory authorities and legislative bodies around the world including in the united states have enacted or are considering enacting a number of legislative and regulatory proposals concerning data protection these laws continue to develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction complying with these various laws could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business noncompliance could result in significant penalties governmental investigations and regulatory proceedings litigation harm to our brand and a decrease in the use of our products and services many of these laws provide for significant penalties under the general data protection regulation in the european union for example potential penalties can be as high as 4 of a company’s total global revenue

gross margins for our products may fluctuate or erode 

 

gross margins in some of our segments are volatile and could decline in the future due to competitive price reductions that are not fully offset by material cost reductions in addition our overall gross margin may fluctuate from period to period due to a number of factors including product mix competition and unit volumes in particular the average selling prices of a specific product tend to decrease over that product’s life to offset such decreases we intend to rely primarily on component cost reduction obtaining yield improvements and corresponding cost reductions in the manufacturing of existing products and on introducing new products that incorporate advanced features and therefore can be sold at higher average selling prices however there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain any such yield improvements or cost reductions or introduce any such new products in the future to the extent that such cost reductions and new product introductions do not occur in a timely manner or our products do not achieve market acceptance our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected

 

 

changes in our united states federal income tax classification or that of our subsidiaries could result in adverse tax consequences to our 10 or greater us shareholders

 

the tax cuts and jobs act the “2017 act” signed on december 22 2017 may have changed the consequences to us shareholders that own or are considered to own as a result of the attribution rules ten percent or more of the voting power or value of the stock of a nonus corporation a 10 us shareholder under the us federal income tax law applicable to owners of us controlled foreign corporations “cfcs”

 

the 2017 act repealed internal revenue code section 958b4 which unless clarified in future regulations or other guidance may result in classification of certain of the company’s foreign subsidiaries as cfcs with respect to any single 10 us shareholder this may be the result without regard to whether 10 us shareholders together own directly or indirectly more than fifty percent of the voting power or value of the company as was the case under prior rules

 

additional tax consequences to 10 us shareholders of a cfc may result from other provisions of the 2017 act for example the 2017 act added section 951a which requires a 10 us shareholder of a cfc to include in income its prorata share of the global intangible lowtaxed income gilti of the cfc the 2017 act also eliminated the requirement in section 951a necessitating that a foreign corporation be considered a cfc for an uninterrupted period of at least 30 days in order for a 10 us shareholder to have a current income inclusion

 

from time to time the company may elect to employ antidilutive measures such as a stock buyback program these measures could inadvertently create additional 10 us shareholders and thus trigger adverse tax consequences for those shareholders as described above we urge shareholders to consult their individual tax advisers for advice regarding the 2017 act revisions to the us federal income tax law applicable to owners of cfcs given the current uncertainty regarding their scope of applicability

 

some of our products are subject to governmental regulation or certification failure to obtain required certifications of our products on a timely basis either due to government shutdown or other delays in the certification process could harm our business 

 

federal aviation administration faa certification is required for all of our aviation products that are intended for installation in typecertificated aircraft to the extent required certification is an expensive and timeconsuming process that requires significant focus and resources an inability to obtain or excessive delay in obtaining such certifications could have an adverse effect on our ability to introduce new products and for certain aviation oem products our customers’ ability to sell airplanes delays in our obtaining certification for our aviation products have resulted and may in the future result in our being required to pay compensation to our customers additionally failure of the united states congress to appropriate funds for faa operations that results in a shutdown of faa operations or furloughing of faa employees due to partial or complete government shutdowns or otherwise could result in delays in the required faa certification of our avionics products and in the production sale and registration of aircraft that use our avionics products therefore such inabilities or delays could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results in addition we cannot assure that our certified products will not be decertified any such decertification could have an adverse effect on our operating results 

 

in addition in accordance with fcc rules and regulations wireless transceiver products are required to be certified by the fcc in the united states and comparable authorities in foreign countries where they are sold garmin’s products sold in europe are required to comply with relevant directives of the european commission a delay in receiving required certifications for new products or enhancements to garmin’s products or losing certification for garmin’s existing products could adversely affect our business 

 

 

our business may suffer if we are not able to hire and retain sufficient qualified personnel or if we lose our key personnel 

 

our future success depends partly on the continued contribution of our key executive engineering sales marketing manufacturing and administrative personnel we currently do not have employment agreements with any of our key executive officers swiss law prohibits us from paying severance payments to our senior executive officers which may impair our ability to recruit for these positions we do not have key person life insurance on any of our key executive officers and do not currently intend to obtain such insurance the loss of the services of any of our senior level management or other key employees could harm our business recruiting and retaining the skilled personnel we require to maintain and grow our market position may be difficult for example in recent years there has been a global shortage of qualified engineers who are necessary for us to design and develop new products and therefore it has sometimes been challenging to recruit such personnel if we fail to hire and retain qualified employees we may not be able to maintain and expand our business 

 

our quarterly operating results are subject to fluctuations and seasonality 

 

our operating results are difficult to predict our future quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly if such operating results decline the price of our stock could decline as we have expanded our operations our operating expenses particularly our research and development costs have increased as a percentage of our sales in some periods if revenues decrease and we continue to increase research and development costs our operating results would be negatively affected 

 

historically our revenues have been lower in the first quarter of each fiscal year as many of our devices are highly consumeroriented and consumer buying is traditionally lower in this quarter sales of certain of our auto fitness marine and outdoor products tend to be higher in our second fiscal quarter due to increased consumer spending for such products in the spring season and travel season sales of many of our consumer products also have been higher in our fourth fiscal quarter due to increased consumer spending patterns on electronic devices during the holiday season 

 

we rely on independent dealers and distributors to sell our products and disruption to these channels would harm our business 

 

because we sell many of our products to independent dealers and distributors we are subject to many risks including risks related to their inventory levels and support for our products in particular our dealers and distributors maintain significant levels of our products in their inventories if dealers and distributors attempt to reduce their levels of inventory or if they do not maintain sufficient levels to meet customer demand our sales could be negatively impacted 

 

many of our dealers and distributors also sell products offered by our competitors if our competitors offer our dealers and distributors more favorable terms those dealers and distributors may deemphasize or decline to carry our products in the future we may not be able to retain or attract a sufficient number of qualified dealers and distributors if we are unable to maintain successful relationships with dealers and distributors or to expand our distribution channels our business will suffer 

 

we may pursue strategic acquisitions investments strategic partnerships or other ventures and our business could be materially harmed if we fail to successfully identify evaluate complete and integrate such transactions 

 

we continually evaluate acquisition opportunities and opportunities to make investments in complementary businesses technologies services or products or to enter into strategic partnerships with parties who can provide access to those assets additional product or services offerings additional distribution or marketing synergies or additional industry expertise we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition investment or strategic partnership candidates or if we do identify suitable candidates in the future we may not be able to complete those transactions on commercially favorable terms or at all 

 

 

any past or future acquisition could also result in difficulties assimilating acquired employees operations and products and diversion of capital and management’s attention away from other business issues and opportunities integration of acquired companies may result in problems related to integration of technology and inexperienced management teams due diligence performed prior to closing acquisitions may not uncover certain risks or liabilities that could materially impact our business and financial results in addition the key personnel of the acquired company may decide not to work for us we may not successfully integrate internal controls compliance under the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 the gdpr and other corporate governance and regulatory matters operations personnel or products related to acquisitions we may make in the future if we fail to successfully integrate such transactions our business could be materially harmed

 

many of our products rely on the global positioning system and other global satellite navigation systems gnss

 

the global positioning system gps is a satellitebased navigation and positioning system consisting of a constellation of orbiting satellites the satellites and their ground control and monitoring stations are maintained and operated by the united states department of defense the department of defense does not currently charge users for access to the satellite signals these satellites and their ground support systems are complex electronic systems subject to electronic and mechanical failures and possible sabotage gps satellites have a limited lifespan and are subject to damage by the hostile space environment in which they operate while many of the original satellites deployed by the us have been in operation for more than 20 years the us space force and missile systems center continue to launch new satellites to replace retired and aged satellites

 

despite ongoing efforts to repair maintain and replace nonoperational satellites if a significant number of satellites were to become inoperable there could be a substantial delay before they are replaced with new satellites a reduction in the number of operating satellites may impair the current utility of gps and the growth of current and additional market opportunities furthermore as gps satellites and ground control segments are being modernized software updates can cause problems we depend on public access to open technical specifications in advance of gps updates

 

gps is operated by the us government which is committed to maintenance and improvement of gps however if the policy were to change and commercial access to gps was no longer supported by the us government or if user fees were imposed it could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition

 

some of our products also use signals from satellite based augmentation systems sbas that augment gps such as the us wide area augmentation system waas japanese mtsatbased satellite augmentation system msas and european geostationary navigation overlay service egnos any curtailment of sbas operating capability could result in decreased user capability for many of our aviation products thereby impacting our markets

 

some of our products also use satellite signals from russia’s glonass japan’s msas egnos’ aviation sol service the european union galileo system and the chinese bds national or european authorities may provide preferential access to signals to companies associated with their markets including our competitors which could harm our competitive position use of nonus gnss signals may also be subject to fcc waiver requirements and to restrictions based upon international trade or geopolitical considerations if we are unable to develop timely and competitive commercial products using these systems or obtain timely and equal access to service signals it could result in lost revenue

 

our business is subject to disruptions and uncertainties caused by geopolitical instability war or terrorism

 

acts of war or acts of terrorism especially any directed at the gps signals could have a material adverse impact on our business operating results and financial condition the threat of terrorism and war and heightened security and military response to this threat or any future acts of terrorism may cause a redeployment of the satellites used in gps or interruptions of the system to the extent that such interruptions have an effect on sales of our products this could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition

 

 

a shut down of airspace or imposition of restrictions on general aviation would harm our business the shutdown of airspace could cause reduced sales of our general aviation products and delays in the shipment of our products manufactured in our taiwan manufacturing facilities to our global distribution facilities thereby adversely affecting our ability to supply new and existing products to our dealers and distributors

 

any reallocation or repurposing of radio frequency spectrum could cause harmful interference with the reception of global positioning system signals this interference could harm our business 

 

our global positioning system technology is dependent on the use of the standard positioning service sps provided by the us government’s gps satellites gps operates in radio frequency bands that are globally allocated for radio navigation satellite services international allocations of radio frequency are made by the international telecommunications union itu a specialized technical agency of the united nations these allocations are further governed by radio regulations that have treaty status and which may be subject to modification every two to three years by the world radio communication conference each country also has regulatory authority on how each band is used in the united states the fcc and the national telecommunications and information administration ntia share responsibility for radio frequency allocations and spectrum usage regulations 

 

any itu or national reallocation of radio frequency spectrum including frequency band segmentation or sharing of spectrum or other modifications of the permitted uses of relevant frequency bands may materially and adversely affect the utility and reliability of our products and have significant negative impacts on our business and our customers 

natural disasters catastrophic events or climate change could affect our financial results 

 

natural disasters and extreme weather events such as tsunamis typhoons floods wildfires or earthquakes could occur in a region where we have a manufacturing or warehousing facility which would cause disruptions in our business operations or loss of inventory global climate change could also result in certain types of natural disasters occurring more frequently or with more intense effects for descriptions and locations of our principal properties see item 2 “properties” these events could also have an impact on our suppliers and affect our supply chain if our backup and recovery plans are not sufficient to minimize business disruption and if our insurance is not sufficient to recover the costs associated with these types of events our financial results could be adversely affected

 

climate change can also pose a risk to our business due to evolving regulatory and legislative measures surrounding climate change the us environmental protection agency regulates greenhouse gas emissions under the authority granted to it under the clean air act us congress in addition to other regulatory authorities and legislative bodies around the world could pass further legislation to mandate greenhouse gas emission reduction implement capandtrade programs or promote renewable energy and energy efficiency such measures could influence mobility and transportation trends which could decrease the demand for certain of our products

 

if climate change has impacts on natural disasters or the regulatory environment as discussed above it could result in a change in demand for certain products in markets that we serve including auto aviation and marine if we fail to adjust our product and service offerings to respond to new opportunities driven by changes in regulation andor consumer preferences it could have an adverse effect on our financial results

 

because it is uncertain what laws and regulations will be enacted we cannot predict the potential impact of such laws and regulations on our future consolidated financial condition results of operations or cash flows

 

 

risks relating to our shares 

the volatility of our stock price could adversely affect investment in our common shares

 

the market price of our shares has been and may continue to be highly volatile during 2020 the closing price of our shares ranged from a low of 6363 to a high of 12285 a variety of factors could cause the price of our shares to fluctuate perhaps substantially including

 



























 

in addition in recent years the stock market in general and the markets for shares of technology companies in particular have experienced extreme price fluctuations which have often been unrelated to the operating performance of affected companies any such fluctuations in the future could adversely affect the market price of our common shares

 

our officers and directors exert substantial influence over us 

 

as of january 26 2021 members of our board of directors and our executive officers together with their respective immediate family members and entities that may be deemed affiliates of or related to such persons or entities beneficially owned approximately 22 of our outstanding shares accordingly these shareholders may be able to determine the outcome of corporate actions requiring shareholder approval such as mergers and acquisitions and shareholder proposals this level of ownership may have a significant effect in delaying deferring or preventing a change in control of garmin and may adversely affect the voting and other rights of other holders of our common shares

 

the rights of our shareholders are governed by swiss law

 

the rights of our shareholders are governed by swiss law and garmin ltd’s articles of association the rights of shareholders under swiss law differ from the rights of shareholders of companies incorporated in other jurisdictions for example swiss law allows our shareholders acting at a shareholders’ meeting to authorize share capital that can be issued by the board of directors without approval of a shareholders’ meeting but this authorization is limited to 50 of the existing registered share capital and must be renewed at a shareholders’ meeting at least every two years for it to continue to be available additionally subject to specified exceptions including the exceptions described in our articles of association swiss law grants preemptive rights to existing shareholders to subscribe for new issuances of shares and other securities swiss law also does not provide as much flexibility in the various terms that can attach to different classes of shares as the laws of some other jurisdictions swiss law also reserves for approval by shareholders certain corporate actions over which a board of directors would have authority in some other jurisdictions for example swiss law provides that dividends and other distributions must be approved by shareholders at the general meeting of shareholders these swiss law requirements relating to our capital management may limit our flexibility and situations may arise where greater flexibility would have provided substantial benefits to our shareholders

 

we have limited capital reserves from which to make distributions or repurchase shares without subjecting our shareholders to switzerland withholding tax

 

as of december 26 2020 we had chf 5214 million of unappropriated capital contribution reserves available from which the company may make dividend payments or utilize to repurchase shares for which no withholding tax applies at the time this reserve balance has been returned to shareholders through dividends or share repurchases a swiss federal withholding tax of 35 will generally be applicable to any dividends paid to shareholders the withholding tax must be withheld from the gross distribution and paid to the swiss federal tax administration a holder that qualifies for benefits under a double tax treaty may be able to recover partial withholding tax for example a us holder that qualifies for benefits under the convention between the united states of america and the swiss confederation for the avoidance of double taxation with respect to taxes on income may apply for a refund of the tax withheld in excess of the 15 treaty rate or in excess of the 5 reduced treaty rate for qualifying corporate shareholders with at least 10 participation in our voting stock or for a full refund in case of qualified pension funds

 

after we have exhausted our remaining capital contribution reserves by appropriating them for dividends or share repurchases any dividends paid by the company will generally be subject to a swiss federal withholding tax at 35 however there can be no assurance that our shareholders will approve a dividend out of capital contribution reserves or that swiss withholding rules will not be changed in the future or that a change in swiss law will not adversely affect us or our shareholders in particular as a result of distributions out of capital contribution reserves becoming subject to additional corporate law or other restrictions if we are unable to pay a dividend out of capital contribution reserves we may not be able to make distributions without subjecting our shareholders to swiss withholding taxes 

 

under current swiss tax law repurchases of shares for the purposes of capital reduction are treated as a partial liquidation subject to 35 swiss withholding tax on the difference between the par value and the repurchase price however the portion of the repurchase price that is attributed to capital contribution reserves of the shares repurchased will not be subject to the swiss withholding tax therefore repurchase of our own shares further limits the amount of capital reserves available for distributions to shareholders free of swiss withholding taxes no partial liquidation treatment applies and no withholding tax is triggered if the shares are not repurchased for cancellation but held by us as treasury shares to the extent sufficient capital reserves are available however should we not resell such treasury shares within six years and there is not sufficient capital contribution reserves the withholding tax becomes due at the end of the sixyear period

 

there is uncertainty as to our shareholders’ ability to enforce certain foreign civil liabilities in switzerland and taiwan 

 

we are a swiss company and a substantial portion of our assets are located outside the united states particularly in taiwan as a result it may be difficult to effect service of process within the united states upon us in addition there is uncertainty as to whether the courts of switzerland or taiwan would recognize or enforce judgments of united states courts obtained against us predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the united states or any state thereof or be competent to hear original actions brought in switzerland or taiwan against us predicated upon the securities laws of the united states or any state thereof

 

we have certain limitations on our ability to repurchase and hold our own shares

 

under swiss law we have certain limitations on our ability to repurchase and hold our own shares we and our subsidiaries may only repurchase and hold our own shares to the extent that sufficient freely distributable reserves including contributed surplus as determined for swiss tax and statutory purposes are available the aggregate par value of our registered shares held by us and our subsidiaries may not exceed 10 of our registered share capital we may repurchase our registered shares beyond the statutory limit of 10 however if our shareholders have adopted a resolution at a general meeting of shareholders authorizing the board of directors to repurchase registered shares in an amount in excess of 10 and the repurchased shares are dedicated for cancellation any restriction on our ability to repurchase our shares could make our stock less attractive to investors

overview

we are a leading worldwide provider of navigation communications and information devices most of which are enabled by global positioning system or gps technology garmin is organized in the six operating segments of auto oem aviation consumer auto fitness marine and outdoor the company’s chief executive officer who has been identified as the chief operating decision maker codm allocates resources and assesses performance of each operating segment individually the aviation fitness marine and outdoor operating segments represent reportable segments the auto oem and consumer auto operating segments which serve the auto market do not meet the quantitative thresholds to separately qualify as reportable segments and they are therefore reported together in an “all other” category captioned as auto auto aviation fitness marine and outdoor are collectively referred to as our reported segments 

the operating segments offer products through our network of subsidiary distributors and independent dealers and distributors our own webshop as well as through various auto aviation and marine oems each of the operating segments is managed separately the consumer auto operating segment was previously referred to as our auto pnd operating segment we have revised the name of this operating segment to reflect the evolution of the product lines and focus of that part of our business the name change did not impact the composition or operating results of the segment

 

since our first products were delivered in 1991 we have generated positive income from consolidated operations each year and have funded our growth from these profits 

 

 

impacts of covid19

 

the covid19 pandemic has created disruption and uncertainty in the global economy and has affected our business suppliers and customers our operating segments were not all impacted equally as covid19 had an unfavorable impact on net sales and profitability of the auto and aviation segments during fiscal year 2020 however the diversity of our business and product offerings helped mitigate the impacts to our consolidated net sales and operating income

 

with preexisting fundamentals such as trade credit insurance direct online sales through our webshops direct fulfillment arrangements with certain retailers our strong cash and marketable securities position market and product diversity a vertically integrated business model and ample inventory on hand we were wellpositioned to mitigate the initial impacts of covid19 while covid19 continues to evolve into a complicated and prolonged global pandemic we have implemented further mitigation measures such as initiating additional direct fulfillment arrangements with retailers mitigating single source supplier dependencies enhancing cleaning and sanitation within our facilities to maintain a healthy and safe environment for essential onsite functions boosting functionality and security of technology for employees who are working from home and fostering the safe reintegration of our onsite workforce these mitigation efforts complement our top priorities of ensuring the health and safety of our employees and continuing to serve our customers additional benefits have been provided to many of our employees including increased flexible work arrangements remote work access and flexible paid leave policies we have also focused on mitigating impacts to operating income and liquidity by monitoring our expense structure and balance sheet reducing and prioritizing certain discretionary operating expenses and capital expenditures and slowing the number of new employees hired

 

sustained adverse impacts to us our suppliers or our customers may affect the future valuation of certain assets and therefore may increase the likelihood of an impairment charge writeoff writedown reserve or accelerated expense associated with such assets including marketable securities accounts receivable inventories prepaid expenses property and equipment tax assets goodwill indefinite and finitelived intangible assets capitalized preproduction design and development costs and other assets 

 

although we believe we have taken appropriate actions to help mitigate risks associated with covid19 as described above the duration and magnitude of covid19 impacts to our business operations and financial results may be affected by a number of factors including uncertainty regarding the evolution of the pandemic the imposition or relaxation of government restrictions on business and social gathering activities voluntary behavior changes associated with public health guidance the efficacy distribution and uptake of vaccines and those presented above in item 1a risk factors of this annual report 

 

critical accounting policies and estimates

general

our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company’s consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the presentation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including those related to customer sales programs and incentives product returns bad debts inventories investments intangible assets income taxes warranty obligations and contingencies and litigation we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions

 

 

goodwill

 

we allocate goodwill to reporting units in proportion to the expected benefit from each business combination each of the company’s operating segments auto oem aviation consumer auto fitness marine and outdoor represents a distinct reporting unit goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value these events or circumstances could include a significant change in the operating performance indicators competition or expectations about future market or economic conditions

 

application of the goodwill impairment test requires significant judgment including the identification of reporting units assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units assignment of goodwill to reporting units and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit the fair value of each reporting unit is estimated through the use of a discounted cash flow methodology this analysis requires significant assumptions including discount rate projected future revenues projected future operating margins and terminal growth rates the estimates used to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit change from year to year based on operating results market conditions and other factors changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and goodwill impairment for each reporting unit

unrecognized income tax benefits

 

we recognize liabilities associated with uncertain income tax positions including those related to transfer pricing based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes will be due we recognize the tax benefits from an uncertain tax position only if payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be not required or it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are measured based on the largest amount of benefit that is more likely than not to be realized upon ultimate settlement 

 

assessing uncertain tax positions requires significant judgment including the evaluation of unique facts and circumstances and the interpretation of laws and regulations especially the assessment of pricing analyses that may produce various ranges of outcomes variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our consolidated financial statements

other

 

for further information on the company’s critical accounting policies refer to the discussion in the notes to the consolidated financial statements as indicated in the table below

 



 

 

accounting terms and characteristics

 

net sales

 

our net sales are primarily generated through sales to our retail partners dealer and distributor network our own webshop and to original equipment manufacturers oems refer to the revenue recognition discussion in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements we aim to achieve a quick turnaround on orders we receive from our retail dealer and distributor customers certain arrangements with oem customers are entered into at the beginning of an aircraft or vehicle life cycle with the intent to fulfill customer purchasing requirements for the entire production life although there are generally no firm volume commitments and sales are therefore generated on an orderbyorder basis as a result we do not believe backlog information is material to the understanding of our business 

 

net sales are subject to seasonal fluctuation typically sales of our consumer products are highest in the fourth quarter due to increased demand during the holiday buying season and in the second quarter due to increased demand during the spring and summer season our auto oem and aviation products do not experience much seasonal variation but are more influenced by the timing of auto program manufacturing aircraft certifications regulatory mandates and the release of new products when the initial demand is typically the strongest

raw material costs are our most significant component of cost of goods sold our existing practice of performing the design and manufacture of our products inhouse has enabled us to source components from different suppliers and where possible to redesign our products to leverage lower cost components we believe that our flexible production model allows our factories to experience relatively low costs of manufacturing in general products manufactured in taiwan have been our highest volume products our manufacturing labor costs historically have been lower in taiwan and china than in olathe and salem 

 

sales price variability has had and can be expected to have an effect on our gross profit our gross profit is dependent on segment mix and to a lesser extent product mix within each segment

 

advertising expense

 

our advertising expenses consist primarily of costs for media advertising cooperative advertising with our retail partners point of sale displays and sponsorships 

 

selling general and administrative expenses

 

our selling general and administrative expenses consist primarily of

 

















 

 

research and development

 

the majority of our research and development costs represent engineering personnel costs costs of test equipment and components used in product and prototype development and outside product development costs 

 

we are committed to increasing the level of innovative design and development of new products as we strive for expanded ability to serve our existing consumer and aviation markets as well as new auto oem programs and new markets for active lifestyle products 

 

income taxes

we have experienced a relatively low effective income tax rate due to the proportion of our income generated by entities in tax jurisdictions with low statutory rates 

 

results of operations

 

the following table sets forth our results of operations as a percentage of net sales during the periods shown the table may not foot due to rounding

 



 

the table below sets forth our results of operations through operating income for each of our five reported segments and supplemental information for the consumer auto and auto oem operating segments that management believes is useful the company’s codm uses operating income as the measure of profit or loss combined with other measures to assess segment performance and allocate resources operating income represents net sales less costs of goods sold and operating expenses net sales are directly attributed to each segment most costs of goods sold and the majority of operating expenses are also directly attributed to each segment while certain other costs of goods sold and operating expenses are allocated to the segments in a manner appropriate to the specific facts and circumstances of the expenses being allocated for each line item in the table below the total of the reported segments’ amounts equals the amount in the consolidated statements of income data included in item 6

 

as indicated in note 8 to the consolidated financial statements the methodology used to allocate certain selling general and administrative expenses was refined at the beginning of the 2019 fiscal year the amounts presented below for the 52weeks ended december 29 2018 are presented here as they were originally reported for comparative purposes we estimate operating income for the 52weeks ended december 29 2018 would have been approximately 18 million less for aviation approximately 11 million more for marine approximately 7 million more for outdoor and not significantly different for auto and fitness

 

 

 



 

net sales

 



 

 

net sales increased 11 in 2020 when compared to the yearago period all operating segments had an increase in revenue except for aviation and consumer auto fitness revenue represented the largest portion of our revenue mix in 2020 at 31 compared to 28 in 2019 

 

total unit sales decreased 13 to 154 million units in 2020 from 156 million units in 2019

 

fitness outdoor marine and auto oem revenues increased 26 23 29 and 1 respectively when compared to the yearago period the fitness revenue increase was primarily driven by strong demand for advanced wearables and cycling products the outdoor revenue increase was driven by sales growth across multiple product categories primarily led by adventure watches marine revenue increases were driven by sales growth across all product categories led primarily by chartplotters and sonar products the auto oem revenue increase was driven by sales growth in new auto oem programs aviation revenue decreased 15 from the yearago period due to fewer shipments to oem customers and reduced contributions from adsb products consumer auto revenue decreased 25 from the yearago period primarily due to the ongoing personal navigation device market contraction

gross profit

 



 

gross profit dollars in fiscal year 2020 increased 11 primarily due to the increase in net sales compared to the yearago period consolidated gross margin was relatively flat compared to fiscal year 2019 the fitness and consumer auto gross margin increases of 210 basis points and 365 basis points respectively were primarily attributable to product mix gross margin remained relatively flat within the outdoor segment the marine and aviation gross margin decreases of 110 basis points and 115 basis points respectively were primarily attributable to product mix the auto oem gross margin decrease of 1010 basis points was primarily attributable to product mix associated with growth in new auto oem programs this product mix and associated gross margin trend is generally expected to continue into 2021 and beyond

advertising expenses

 



 

 

advertising expense decreased 8 in absolute dollars and decreased slightly as a percent of revenue in fiscal year 2020 compared to fiscal year 2019 the overall decrease in absolute dollars was primarily attributable to decreased media advertising in fitness and outdoor and decreased cooperative advertising in consumer auto these decreases were partially offset by increased cooperative advertising expense in fitness outdoor and marine advertising expenses in all operating segments decreased slightly as a percent of revenue compared to the prior year

selling general and administrative expenses

 



 

selling general and administrative expense increased 10 in absolute dollars and was relatively flat as a percent of revenue when compared to the prior year the absolute dollar increase was primarily attributable to information technology costs and personnel related expenses

 

as noted above and in note 8 to the consolidated financial statements the company refined its methodology to allocate certain selling general and administrative expenses at the beginning of the 2019 fiscal year the prior year amounts are presented here as originally reported for comparative purposes we estimate selling general and administrative expenses for fiscal year 2018 would have been approximately 18 million more for aviation approximately 11 million less for marine approximately 7 million less for outdoor and not significantly different for fitness and auto 

 

research and development expense

 



 

 

research and development expense increased 17 in absolute dollars when compared to the yearago period and increased slightly as a percent of revenue the absolute dollar increase was primarily due to engineering personnel costs across all of our operating segments and other expenses related to auto oem programs the auto oem increase in absolute dollars and as a percent of revenue was primarily attributable to higher engineering personnel costs and other expenses related to investments in auto oem programs and a lower proportion of such costs being contractually reimbursable in fiscal year 2020 this trend of increasing auto oem research and development expense is expected to continue in 2021 as we expect higher total costs and the majority of costs will not be contractually reimbursable 

 

operating income

 



 

total operating income increased 11 in absolute dollars and was relatively flat as a percent of revenue when compared to fiscal year 2019 the growth in total operating income on an absolute dollar basis was the result of revenue growth as discussed above operating income in absolute dollars and as a percent of revenue decreased in aviation primarily due to a decline in sales compared to the yearago period auto oem experienced an operating loss in fiscal year 2020 and we expect this trend of an operating loss to continue in 2021 primarily due to a lower gross margin and increased expense associated with certain programs as described above

other income expense

 



 

the average returns on cash and investments including interest and capital gainloss returns during the 52weeks ended december 26 2020 and december 28 2019 were 14 and 20 respectively interest income decreased primarily due to lower yields on fixedincome securities

 

foreign currency gains and losses for the company are typically driven by movements of a number of currencies in relation to the us dollar the taiwan dollar is the functional currency of garmin corporation the euro is the functional currency of several subsidiaries and the us dollar is the functional currency of garmin europe ltd although some transactions and balances are denominated in british pounds other notable currency exposures include the australian dollar and chinese yuan the majority of the company’s consolidated foreign currency gain or loss is typically driven by the significant cash and marketable securities receivables and payables held in a currency other than the functional currency at a given legal entity 

 

the 28 million currency gain recognized in fiscal 2020 was primarily due to the us dollar weakening against the euro australian dollar chinese yuan and british pound sterling partially offset by the us dollar weakening against the taiwan dollar during fiscal 2020 the us dollar weakened 92 against the euro 94 against the australian dollar 72 against the chinese yuan and 36 against the british pound sterling resulting in gains of 211 million 65 million 29 million and 26 million respectively while the us dollar weakened 71 against the taiwan dollar resulting in a loss of 322 million the remaining net currency gain of 19 million is related to the timing of transactions and impacts of other currencies each of which was individually immaterial

 

the 168 million currency loss recognized in fiscal 2019 was primarily due to the us dollar strengthening against the euro and weakening against the taiwan dollar offset by the us dollar weakening against the british pound sterling during fiscal 2019 the us dollar strengthened 23 against the euro and weakened 15 against the taiwan dollar resulting in losses of 93 million and 71 million respectively while the us dollar weakened 29 against the british pound sterling resulting in a gain of 28 million the remaining net currency loss of 32 million is related to the timing of transactions and impacts of other currencies each of which was individually immaterial

 

income tax provision

 

income tax expense for the fiscal year ended december 26 2020 was 1111 million compared to income tax expense of 347 million for the fiscal year ended december 28 2019 representing a net increase of 764 million contributing to the yearoveryear increase in income tax expense in fiscal year 2020 was an income tax benefit of 1180 million recognized in fiscal year 2019 associated with the revaluation and stepup of certain switzerland tax assets as a result of the october 2019 enactment of switzerland federal and schaffhausen cantonal tax reform and related transitional measures a revaluation of these assets performed in the fourth quarter of 2020 resulted in an 110 million income tax expense in fiscal year 2020 in connection with these transitional measures included in switzerland tax reform a reduced income tax rate will be utilized on certain switzerland taxable income for up to five years the company also recognized a 143 million income tax benefit in fiscal 2020 due to the release of uncertain tax position reserves associated with a 2014 intercompany restructuring

 

excluding the aforementioned 110 million income tax expense and 143 million income tax benefit in fiscal 2020 and the 1180 million tax benefit in fiscal 2019 income tax expense for fiscal years 2020 and 2019 was 1144 million and 1527 million respectively in this comparison income tax expense for fiscal year 2020 was lower primarily due to a transaction initiated by the company in february 2020 between whollyowned subsidiaries to migrate ownership of certain intellectual property from switzerland to the united states the primary location of research development and executive management the migration which includes a multiyear intercompany license of intellectual property has resulted in a favorable shift of income mix by jurisdiction and a reduction in expense related to uncertain tax positions during the term of the license agreement this transaction is expected to continue to result in a lower effective income tax rate as compared to the fiscal year 2019 effective income tax rate excluding the 1180 million income tax benefit in 2019 described above the company is pursuing an advance pricing agreement between relevant jurisdictions related to this transaction at the end of the license agreement a higher percentage of income will be recognized in the united states

 

net income 

 

as a result of the various factors noted above net income increased 4 to 9923 million from 9525 million in the prior year 

 

 

liquidity and capital resources

 

as of december 26 2020 we had approximately 30 billion of cash cash equivalents and marketable securities we primarily use cash flow from operations and expect that future cash requirements may be used to fund our capital expenditures support our working capital requirements pay dividends and fund strategic acquisitions we believe that our existing cash balances and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our short and longterm projected working capital needs capital expenditures and other cash requirements

 

it is management’s goal to invest the onhand cash in accordance with the investment policy which has been approved by the company’s board of directors the investment policy’s primary purpose is to preserve capital maintain an acceptable degree of liquidity and maximize yield within the constraint of low credit risk garmin’s average interest rate returns on cash and investments during fiscal 2020 2019 and 2018 were approximately 14 20 and 19 respectively the fair value of our securities varies from period to period due to changes in interest rates in the performance of the underlying collateral and in the credit performance of the underlying issuer among other factors see note 8 for additional information regarding marketable securities

operating activities

 



 

the 4367 million increase in cash provided by operating activities in fiscal year 2020 compared to fiscal year 2019 was due to a decrease in cash used in working capital of 2943 million which included an increase of 145 million in net receipts of accounts receivable a decrease of 1989 million in cash paid for inventory a decrease of 136 million net cash used for income taxes and a decrease of 920 million net cash used in other activities primarily driven by prior year payments associated with an amendment to a license agreement partially offset by an increase of 247 million net cash used in accounts payable additional changes were due to the yearoveryear increase in net income of 398 million and an increase in other noncash adjustments to net income of 1026 million primarily driven by a prior year income tax benefit of 1180 million associated with the revaluation and stepup of certain switzerland tax assets 

investing activities

 



 

the 1902 million decrease in cash used in investing activities in fiscal year 2020 compared to fiscal year 2019 was primarily due to a decrease in cash payments for acquisitions of 1516 million an increase in net redemptions of marketable securities of 1042 million and partially offset by increased net purchases of property and equipment of 659 million

financing activities

 



 

the 457 million increase in cash used in financing activities in fiscal year 2020 compared to fiscal year 2019 was primarily due to an increase in dividend payments of 334 million

 

our declared dividend has increased from 053 per share for the four calendar quarters beginning in june 2018 to 057 per share for the four calendar quarters beginning in june 2019 and to 061 per share for the four calendar quarters beginning in june 2020

contractual obligations and commercial commitments 

as of december 26 2020 operating leases comprise the substance of the company’s commercial commitments with longterm scheduled payments as summarized below

 



 

the company is party to certain other commitments which include purchases of raw materials capital expenditures advertising and other indirect purchases in connection with conducting our business the aggregate amount of purchase orders and other commitments open as of december 26 2020 was approximately 8800 million we cannot determine the aggregate amount of such purchase orders that represent contractual obligations because purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements our purchase orders are generally based on our current needs and are typically fulfilled within short periods of time

 

we may be required to make significant cash outlays related to unrecognized tax benefits however due to the uncertainty of the timing of future cash flows associated with our unrecognized tax benefits we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement if any with the respective taxing authorities accordingly unrecognized tax benefits of 850 million as of december 26 2020 have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above for further information related to unrecognized tax benefits see note 2 – summary of significant accounting policies income taxes and note 6 – income taxes to the consolidated financial statements included in this report

offbalance sheet arrangements

we do not have any offbalance sheet arrangements

 item 7a 

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

tableend

market sensitivity

 

we have market risk primarily in connection with the pricing of our products and services and the purchase of raw materials product pricing and raw materials costs are both significantly influenced by semiconductor market conditions historically during cyclical industry downturns we have been able to offset pricing declines for our products through a combination of improved product mix and success in obtaining price reductions in raw materials costs

 

inflation

 

we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our business financial condition or results of operations if our costs were to become subject to significant inflationary pressures we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs through price increases our inability or failure to do so could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations

foreign currency exchange rate risk

 

the operation of garmin’s subsidiaries in international markets results in exposure to movements in currency exchange rates we have experienced significant foreign currency gains and losses due to the strengthening and weakening of the us dollar the potential of volatile foreign exchange rate fluctuations in the future could have a significant effect on our results of operations the company has not historically hedged its foreign currency exchange rate risks

 

 

the currencies that create a majority of the company’s exchange rate exposure are the taiwan dollar euro british pound sterling australian dollar chinese yuan and japanese yen garmin corporation headquartered in xizhi taiwan uses the local currency as the functional currency the company translates all assets and liabilities at year ‐ end exchange rates and income and expense accounts at average rates during the year in order to minimize the effect of the currency exchange fluctuations on our net assets we have elected to retain most of our taiwan subsidiary’s cash and investments denominated in us dollars

 

most european subsidiaries use the euro as the functional currency the functional currency of our largest european subsidiary garmin europe ltd remains the us dollar and as some transactions occur in british pounds sterling or euros foreign currency gains or losses have been realized historically related to the movements of those currencies relative to the us dollar the company believes that gains and losses may become more material in the future as our european presence grows

 

during fiscal year 2020 the company incurred a net foreign currency gain of 28 million the us dollar weakening against the euro australian dollar chinese yuan and british pound sterling was partially offset by the us dollar weakening against the taiwan dollar during fiscal 2020 the us dollar weakened 92 against the euro 94 against the australian dollar 72 against the chinese yuan and 36 against the british pound sterling resulting in gains of 211 million 65 million 29 million and 26 million respectively while the us dollar weakened 71 against the taiwan dollar resulting in a loss of 322 million the remaining net currency gain of 19 million was related to the timing of transactions and impacts of other currencies each of which was individually immaterial these and other currency moves during fiscal year 2020 also resulted in a currency translation adjustment of 1077 million within accumulated other comprehensive income

 

we assessed the company’s exposure to movements in currency exchange rates by performing a sensitivity analysis of adverse changes in exchange rates and the corresponding impact to our results of operations based on monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than respective functional currencies as of december 26 2020 and december 28 2019 hypothetical and reasonably possible adverse changes of 10 for the taiwan dollar euro and british pound sterling would have resulted in an adverse impact on income before income taxes of approximately 84 million and 90 million at december 26 2020 and december 28 2019

interest rate risk

 

we have no outstanding longterm debt as of december 26 2020 we therefore have no meaningful debtrelated interest rate risk 

 

we are exposed to interest rate risk in connection with our investments in marketable securities as interest rates change the unrealized gains and losses associated with those securities will fluctuate accordingly 

 

the company’s investment policy targets low risk investments with the objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss the company does not intend to sell securities in an unrealized loss position and it is not more likely than not that the company will be required to sell such investments before recovery of their amortized costs bases which may be maturity during 2020 and 2019 the company did not record any material impairment charges on its outstanding securities

 

we assessed the company’s exposure to interest rate risk by performing a sensitivity analysis of a parallel shift in the yield curve and the corresponding impact to the company’s portfolio of marketable securities based on balance sheet positions as of december 26 2020 and december 28 2019 the hypothetical and reasonably possible 100 basis point increases in interest rates across all securities would have resulted in declines in portfolio fair market value of approximately 34 million and 35 million at december 26 2020 and december 28 2019 respectively such losses would only be realized if the company sold the investments prior to maturity

competition 

 

we operate in highly competitive markets though competitive conditions do vary among our diverse products and geographies garmin believes the principal competitive factors impacting the market for its products are design functionality quality and reliability customer service brand price timetomarket and availability garmin believes that it generally competes favorably in each of these areas and as such is generally a significant competitor in each of our major markets

 

garmin believes that its principal competitor for portable automotive products is tomtom nv garmin believes that its principal competitors for infotainment solutions are alpine electronics harman international industries the mitsubishi group and panasonic corporation garmin believes that its principal competitors for outdoor product lines are casio dogtra samsung shearwater research sportdog brand suunto tag heuer tissot and vista outdoor garmin believes that its principal competitors for fitness products are apple bryton fitbit huami huawei polar electro oy samsung sigma sports suunto and wahoo fitness for marine products garmin believes that its principal competitors are flir systems furuno the humminbird division of johnson outdoors and navico for garmin’s aviation product lines garmin considers its principal competitors to be aspen avionics avidyne corporation cmc electronics collins aerospace dynon avionics genesys aerosystems honeywell aerospace  defense innovative solutions and support inc l3 avionics systems safran sa thales and universal avionics systems corporation

 

research and development 

 

garmin’s product innovations are driven by its strong emphasis on research and development and the close partnership between garmin’s engineering and manufacturing teams garmin’s products are created by its engineering and development staff which numbered approximately 4500 people worldwide as of december 28 2019 garmin’s manufacturing staff which numbered approximately 4900 people worldwide as of december 28 2019 includes manufacturing process engineers who work closely with garmin’s design engineers to ensure manufacturability and manufacturing cost control for its products garmin’s development staff includes industrial designers as well as software engineers electrical engineers mechanical engineers and cartographic engineers garmin believes the industrial design of its products has played an important role in garmin’s success once a development project is initiated and approved a multidisciplinary team is created to design the product and transition it into manufacturing

 

manufacturing and operations 

 

garmin believes one of its core competencies and strengths is its vertically integrated manufacturing capabilities at its taiwan facilities in xizhi jhongli and linkou its china facility in yangzhou its netherlands facility in wassenaar and at its us facilities in olathe kansas and salem oregon garmin believes that its ownership and operation of its own manufacturing facilities and distribution networks provides significant capability and flexibility to address the breadth and depth of resources necessary to serve its diverse products and markets

 

specifically garmin believes that its vertical integration of its manufacturing capabilities provides advantages to product cost quality and time to market 

 

cost garmin’s manufacturing resources rapidly and iteratively prototype designs concepts products and processes achieving higher efficiency resulting in lower cost garmin’s vertical integration approach enables leveraging of manufacturing resources across high mid and low volume products sharing of these resources across product lines favorably affects garmin’s costs to produce its range of products with lower volume products realizing the economies of scale of higher volume products the ownership and integration of its resources allows garmin to optimize the design for manufacturing of its products yielding improved cost  

 

quality garmin’s automation and sophisticated production processes provide inservice robustness and consistent reliability standards that enable garmin to maintain strict process and quality control of the products manufactured thereby improving the overall quality of our products additionally the immediate feedback throughout the manufacturing processes is provided to the development teams providing integrated continuous improvement throughout design and supply chain 

 

time to market garmin uses multidisciplinary teams of design engineers process engineers and supply chain specialists to develop products allowing them to quickly move from concept to manufacturing this integrated ownership provides inherent flexibility to enable faster time to market 

 

garmin’s design manufacturing distribution and servicing processes in its us taiwan china and uk facilities are certified to iso 9001 an international quality standard developed by the international organization for standardization garmin’s automotive operations in taiwan china uk and olathe have achieved iatf 16949 certification a quality standard for automotive suppliers garmin’s olathe and salem aviation operations have achieved certification to as9100 the quality standard for the aviation industry 

 

garmin international inc garmin europe ltd and garmin corporation have also achieved certification of their environmental management systems to the iso 14001 standard recognizing garmin’s systems and processes which minimize or prevent harmful effects on the environment and continually strive to improve its environmental performance

 

materials 

 

although most components essential to garmin’s business are generally available from multiple sources certain key components are currently obtained by the company from single or limited sources which subjects garmin to supply and pricing risks many of these and other key components that are available from multiple sources including but not limited to nand flash memory dynamic random access memory dram gps chipsets and certain lcds are subject at times to industrywide shortages and commodity pricing fluctuations 

 

garmin and other participants in the personal computer tablet mobile communication aviation electronics and consumer electronics industries also compete for various components with other industries that have experienced increased demand for their products in addition garmin uses some custom components that are not common to the rest of the personal computer tablet mobile communication and consumer electronics industries new products introduced by the company often utilize custom components available from only one source until garmin has evaluated whether there is a need for and subsequently qualifies additional suppliers when a component or product uses new technologies initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields have matured or manufacturing capacity has increased garmin makes efforts to manage risks in these areas through the use of supply agreements and safety stock for strategically important components 

 

seasonality

 

our net sales are subject to seasonal fluctuation sales of our consumer products are generally higher in the fourth quarter due to increased demand during the holiday buying season and to a lesser extent the second quarter due to increased demand during the spring and summer season sales of consumer products are also influenced by the timing of the release of new products our auto oem and aviation products do not experience much seasonal variation but are more influenced by the timing of auto program manufacturing aircraft certifications regulatory mandates and the release of new products when the initial demand is typically the strongest

 

backlog

 

there is a relatively short cycle between order and shipment therefore we believe that backlog information is not material to the understanding of our business we typically ship most orders within 72 hours of receipt

 

intellectual property 

 

our success and ability to compete is dependent in part on our proprietary technology we rely on a combination of patent copyright trademark and trade secret laws as well as confidentiality agreements to establish and protect our proprietary rights in addition garmin often relies on licenses of intellectual property for use in its business for example garmin obtains licenses from various sources for digital cartography technology for use in our products 

 

as of january 10 2020 garmin has been issued over 1350 patents throughout the world and holds more than 900 trademark registrations the duration of patents varies in accordance with the provisions of applicable local law we believe that our continued success depends on the intellectual skills of our employees and their ability to continue to innovate garmin will continue to file and prosecute patent applications when appropriate to attempt to protect garmin’s rights in its proprietary technologies 

 

there is no assurance that our current patents or patents which we may later acquire may successfully withstand any challenge in whole or in part it is also possible that any patent issued to us may not provide us with any competitive advantages or that the patents of others will preclude us from manufacturing and marketing certain products despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights to protect our trade secrets to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others or to defend against claims of infringement or invalidity

 

regulations 

 

the telecommunications industry is highly regulated and the regulatory environment in which garmin operates is subject to change in accordance with the united states’ federal communications commission fcc rules and regulations wireless transceiver products are required to be certified by the fcc and comparable authorities in foreign countries where they are sold garmin’s products sold in europe are required to comply with relevant directives of the european commission a delay in receiving required certifications for new products or enhancements to garmin’s products or losing certification for garmin’s existing products could adversely affect our business in addition aviation products that are intended for installation in “type certificated aircraft” are required to be certified by the faa its european counterpart the european aviation safety agency and other comparable organizations before they can be used in an aircraft 

 

because garmin corporation one of the company’s principal subsidiaries is located in taiwan foreign exchange control laws and regulations of taiwan with respect to remittances into and out of taiwan may have an impact on garmin’s operations the taiwan foreign exchange control statute and regulations thereunder provides that all foreign exchange transactions must be executed by banks designated to handle such business by the ministry of finance of taiwan and by the central bank of the republic of china taiwan also referred to as the cbc current regulations favor traderelated foreign exchange transactions consequently foreign currency earned from exports of merchandise and services may now be retained and used freely by exporters while all foreign currency needed for the import of merchandise and services may be purchased freely from the designated foreign exchange banks aside from traderelated foreign exchange transactions taiwan companies and residents may without foreign exchange approval remit outside and into taiwan foreign currencies of up to 50 million and 5 million respectively or their equivalent each calendar year currency conversions within the limits are processed by the designated banks and do not have to be reviewed and approved by the cbc the above limits apply to remittances involving a conversion between taiwan dollars and us dollars or other foreign currencies the cbc typically approves foreign exchange in excess of the limits if a party applies with the cbc for review and presents legitimate business reasons justifying the currency conversion a requirement is also imposed on all enterprises to register all medium and longterm foreign debt with the cbc 

 

environmental matters 

 

garmin’s operations are subject to various environmental laws including laws addressing air and water pollution and management of hazardous substances and wastes substantial noncompliance with applicable environmental laws could have a material adverse effect on our business capital expenditures for environmental controls are included in our normal capital budget historically capital expenditures associated with environmental controls have not been material and compliance with environmental laws has not had a material impact on the company’s competitive position 

 

many of garmins products are subject to laws relating to the chemical and material composition of our products and their energy efficiency garmin is also subject to laws requiring manufacturers to be financially responsible for collection recovery and recycling of wastes from certain electronic products compliance with current environmental laws does not have a material impact on our business but the impact of future enactment of environmental laws cannot yet be fully determined and could be substantial

 

garmin has implemented multiple environmental management system ems policies in accordance with the international organization for standardization iso 14001 standard for environmental health and safety management garmin’s ems policies set forth practices standards and procedures to ensure compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations at garmin’s kansas headquarters facility garmin’s european headquarters facility and garmin’s taiwan and china manufacturing facilities 

 

garmin continues to strive to reduce our carbon footprint by increasing our environmental sustainability efforts our manufacturing locations have implemented increased recycling processes that keep all obsolete garmin manufactured material from entering the waste stream additionally our newly completed facility in olathe kansas has been constructed with energy efficient considerations including reduced water consumption led lighting and reflective roofing to deflect solar radiation

 

employees 

 

as of december 28 2019 the company had approximately 15000 full and parttime employees worldwide of whom approximately 5700 were in americas region 7300 were in apac and 2000 were in emea except for some of garmin’s employees in sweden none of garmin’s employees are represented by a labor union and none of garmins north american or taiwan employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement garmin considers its employee relations to be positive

risk factors

tableend

the risks described below are not the only ones facing our company additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also impair our business operations if any of the following risks occur our business financial condition or operating results could be materially adversely affected

risks related to the company

if we are not successful in the continued development timely manufacture and introduction of new products or product categories demand for our products could decrease to the extent that lost sales and profits from declining segments or product categories are not entirely offset 

we expect that a significant portion of our future revenue will continue to be derived from sales of newly introduced products this is particularly important to replace sales and profits lost in declining segments or product categories the market for our products is characterized by rapidly changing technology evolving industry standards and changes in customer needs if we fail to introduce new products or to modify or improve our existing products in response to changes in technology industry standards or customer needs our products could rapidly become less competitive or obsolete we must continue to make significant investments in research and development in order to continue to develop new products enhance existing products and achieve market acceptance for such products however there can be no assurance that development stage products will be successfully completed or if developed will achieve significant customer acceptance 

if we are unable to successfully develop and introduce competitive new products and enhance our existing products our future results of operations would be adversely affected our pursuit of necessary technology may require substantial time and expense we may need to license new technologies to respond to technological change these licenses may not be available to us on terms that we can accept or may materially change the gross profits that we are able to obtain on our products we may not succeed in adapting our products to new technologies as they emerge development and manufacturing schedules for technology products are difficult to predict and there can be no assurance that we will achieve timely initial customer shipments of new products the timely availability of these products in volume and their acceptance by customers are important to our future success any future challenges related to new products whether due to product development delays manufacturing delays lack of market acceptance delays in regulatory approval or otherwise could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

if we are unable to compete effectively with existing or new competitors our resulting loss of competitive position could result in price reductions fewer customer orders reduced margins and loss of market share 

the markets for many of our products are highly competitive and we expect competition to increase in the future some of our competitors have significantly greater financial technical and marketing resources than we do these competitors may be able to respond more rapidly to new or emerging technologies or changes in customer requirements they may also be able to devote greater resources to the development promotion and sale of their products or secure better product positioning with retailers increased competition could result in price reductions fewer customer orders reduced margins and loss of market share our failure to compete successfully against current or future competitors could seriously harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

maturation or contraction of the market for wearable devices or categories of devices could adversely affect our revenue and profits 

we have experienced growth in sales and profits in our outdoor and fitness segments which in recent years have benefited from increased sales of wearable devices if the overall wearable device market declines or categories of devices within the wearable device market decline significantly our business financial condition or operating results could be materially adversely affected

 

our annual and quarterly financial statements will reflect fluctuations in foreign currency translation

 

the operation of our subsidiaries in global markets results in exposure to movements in currency exchange rates we have experienced significant foreign currency gains and losses due to the strengthening and weakening of the us dollar relative to certain other currencies the potential of volatile foreign exchange rate fluctuations in the future could have a significant effect on our results of operations we have not historically used financial instruments to hedge our foreign currency exchange rate risks

 

the currencies that typically create a majority of our exchange rate exposure are the taiwan dollar euro and british pound sterling the taiwan dollar is the functional currency of garmin corporation the us dollar is the functional currency of garmin europe ltd and the euro is the functional currency of most of our other european subsidiaries although some transactions and balances are denominated in british pounds other legal entities primarily use the local currency as the functional currency due to the relative size of entities using a functional currency other than the taiwan dollar euro and british pound sterling fluctuations of other currencies are not expected to have a material impact on our financial statements 

 

we translate income and expense activity at the approximate rate of exchange at the transaction date and all assets and liabilities at the rate of exchange in effect at the balance sheet date income and expense activity in a currency other than the us dollar can be impacted by exchange rate variations over time the majority of our consolidated foreign currency gain or loss is typically driven by exchange rate impacts on the significant cash receivables and payables held in a currency other than the functional currency at a given legal entity such gain or loss will create variations in our earnings per share however because there is minimal cash impact caused by such exchange rate variations management will continue to focus on our operating performance before the impact of foreign currency gains and losses 

 

changes in applicable tax laws or resolutions of tax disputes could result in adverse tax consequences to the company 

 

our tax positions could be adversely impacted by changes to tax laws tax treaties or tax regulations or the interpretation or enforcement thereof by any tax authority in which we file income tax returns particularly in the us switzerland taiwan and uk we cannot predict the outcome of any specific legislative proposals 

 

global taxing standards continue to evolve as a result of the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd recommendations aimed at preventing perceived base erosion and profit shifting beps by multinational corporations while these recommendations do not change tax law the countries where we operate may implement legislation or take unilateral actions which may result in adverse effects to our income tax provision and financial statements partially to respond to recent and continuing changes to global tax standards we initiated an intercompany transaction which migrates ownership of certain consumer products intellectual property from switzerland to the united states which is the primary location of research development and executive management due to the subjectivity inherent in transfer pricing associated with this intercompany transaction we are pursuing an advanced pricing agreement with relevant jurisdictions to provide certainty regarding the pricing however we are unable to predict the outcome of the final advanced pricing agreement and related negotiations which could materially andor adversely impact our income tax provision net income or cash flows for periods during negotiation and upon finalization 

 

significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes in the ordinary course of our business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain most notably in the area of transfer pricing we are regularly under audit by tax authorities although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals the results of an audit or litigation could have a material effect on our income tax provision net income or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made

 

changes to trade regulations including trade restrictions sanctions or tariffs could significantly harm our results of operations 

 

we manufacture goods in the people’s republic of china and import certain materials from the people’s republic of china that are used to manufacture goods in the united states the imposition of additional governmental controls or regulations that create new or enhanced restrictions on free trade trade sanctions or tariffs particularly those applicable to materials or goods from the people’s republic of china could have a substantial adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition

 

economic regulatory and political conditions and uncertainty could adversely affect our revenue and profits

 

our revenue and profits depend significantly on general economic conditions and the demand for products in the markets in which we compete we have global operations which make up a significant portion of our total revenue which can present challenges depending on economic and geopolitical conditions on both a global and regional scale economic weakness or constrained consumer and business spending has resulted in periods of decreased revenue in the past and could in the future result in decreased revenue and problems with our ability to manage inventory levels and collect customer receivables in addition financial difficulties experienced by our retailers and oem customers have resulted and could result in the future in significant bad debt writeoffs and additions to reserves in our receivables and could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

 

we may experience unique economic and political risks associated with companies that operate in taiwan 

 

our principal manufacturing facilities where we manufacture most of our consumer products are located in taiwan relations between taiwan and the people’s republic of china also referred to as the prc and other factors affecting the political or economic conditions of taiwan in the future could materially affect our business financial condition and results of operations and the market price and the liquidity of our shares 

 

the prc asserts sovereignty over all of china including taiwan certain other islands and all of mainland china the prc government does not recognize the legitimacy of the taiwan government although significant economic and cultural relations have been established during recent years between taiwan and the prc the prc government has indicated that it may use military force to gain control over taiwan in certain circumstances such as the declaration of independence by taiwan the united states relations with taiwan are governed by the 1979 taiwan relations act which signifies when the us switched diplomatic recognition from taiwan to the prc referred to as the onechina policy deviations from the onechina policy could lead to adverse changes in chinaus and chinataiwan relations and could adversely affect our operations in taiwan in the future

 

if we do not correctly anticipate demand for our products we may not be able to secure sufficient quantities or costeffective production of our products or we could have costly excess production or inventories 

 

we have generally been able to increase or decrease production to meet fluctuations in demand however the demand for our products depends on many factors and may be difficult to forecast we expect that it will become more difficult to forecast demand as we introduce and support a diverse product portfolio as competition in the market for our products intensifies and as the markets for some of our products mature significant unanticipated fluctuations in demand could cause the following problems in our operations 

 







 

we depend on third party suppliers and licensors some of which are sole source for specific components and map data used in our products our production and business would be seriously harmed if these suppliers are not able to meet our demand and alternative sources are not available or if the costs of components rise 

 

we are dependent on third party suppliers for various components used in our current products some of the components that we procure from third party suppliers include semiconductors and electroluminescent panels liquid crystal displays memory chips batteries and microprocessors the cost quality and availability of components are essential to the successful production and sale of our products some components we use are from sole source suppliers certain applicationspecific integrated circuits incorporating our proprietary designs are manufactured for us by sole source suppliers alternative sources may not be currently available for these sole source components 

 

in the past we have experienced shortages of certain components in addition if there are shortages in supply of components the costs of such components may rise if suppliers are unable to meet our demand for components on a timely basis and if we are unable to obtain an alternative source or if the price of the alternative source is prohibitive our ability to maintain timely and costeffective production of our products would be seriously harmed 

 

we are also dependent on third party licensors for digital mapping data used in our products there are only a limited number of suppliers of mapping data for some of our products and geographical regions if we are unable to continue licensing such mapping data from our suppliers and are unable to obtain an alternative source or if our relationships with our suppliers change detrimentally our ability to supply mapping data for use in our products would be seriously harmed 

 

the effects of the united kingdom’s withdrawal from the european union “brexit” including trade agreements are not yet known and the uncertainty creates challenges and risks which could have a material effect on our business and results of operations

 

the united kingdom uk formally left the european union eu on january 31 2020 a transition period through december 31 2020 has been established to allow the uk and eu to negotiate the terms of the uk’s withdrawal however there is continued uncertainty surrounding the future relationship between the uk and eu including trade agreements between the uk and eu additionally longterm risks of brexit include economic recessions in the uk or other european markets and currency instability for both the british pound sterling and the euro

 

we have operations in the uk including offices and a distribution facility and several eu member states and therefore brexit will impact our operations we have certain measures in place to reduce the impact to our business operations however risks such as slow or inefficient border clearance prolonged economic recession and currency fluctuations could have material adverse effects on our business operations results of operations and financial condition as noted in our other risk factors currency volatility of the british sterling pound and euro could have significant effects on our results of operations depending on finalization of a trade agreement between the uk and the eu during the transition period the impacts of brexit may have a lesser impact to our financial condition and business operations given the number of different outcomes still possible the impacts of brexit are difficult to determine until specific terms of the withdrawal are reached

 

our intellectual property rights are important to our operations and we could suffer loss if they infringe upon others’ rights or are infringed upon by others 

 

we rely on a combination of patents copyrights trademarks and trade secrets confidentiality provisions and licensing arrangements to establish and protect our proprietary rights to this end we hold rights to a number of patents and registered trademarks and regularly file applications to attempt to protect our rights in new technology and trademarks however there is no guarantee that our patent applications will become issued patents or that our trademark applications will become registered trademarks in addition effective copyright patent and trade secret protection may be unavailable limited or not applied for in certain countries moreover even if approved our patents or trademarks may thereafter be successfully challenged by others or otherwise become invalidated for a variety of reasons thus any patents or trademarks we currently have or may later acquire may not provide us a significant competitive advantage 

 

the value of our products relies substantially on our technical innovation in fields in which there are many patent filings third parties may claim that we or our customers some of whom are indemnified by us are infringing their intellectual property rights for example individuals and groups may purchase intellectual property assets for the purpose of asserting claims of infringement and attempting to extract settlements from us or our customers the number of these claims has increased in recent years and may continue to increase in the future such claims could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition from time to time we receive letters alleging infringement of patents trademarks or other intellectual property rights and we have been and currently are a defendant in lawsuits alleging patent infringement litigation concerning patents or other intellectual property is costly and time consuming we may seek licenses from such parties but they could refuse to grant us a license or demand commercially unreasonable terms such infringement claims could also cause us to incur substantial liabilities and to suspend or permanently cease the use of critical technologies or processes or the production or sale of major products 

 

we may become subject to significant product liability costs 

 

if our products malfunction or contain errors or defects we could be subject to significant liability for personal injury and property damage and under certain circumstances could be subject to a judgment for punitive damages we maintain insurance against accidentrelated risks involving our products however there can be no assurance that such insurance would be sufficient to cover the cost of damages to others or that such insurance will continue to be available at commercially reasonable rates in addition insurance coverage may not cover awards of punitive damages and may not cover the cost of associated legal fees and defense costs which could result in lower margins if we are unable to maintain sufficient insurance to cover product liability costs or if our insurance coverage does not cover the award this could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we have claims and lawsuits against us that may result in adverse outcomes

we are subject to a variety of claims and lawsuits adverse outcomes in some or all of these claims may result in significant monetary damages or injunctive relief that could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business litigation and other claims are subject to inherent uncertainties and the outcomes can be difficult to predict management may not adequately reserve for a contingent liability or we may suffer unforeseen liabilities which could then impact the results of a financial period a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements could occur for the period in which the effect of an unfavorable final outcome becomes probable and reasonably estimable which if not expected could harm our results of operations and financial condition

 

continued declines in auto pnd revenue and significant investments in auto oem could negatively impact total company profits and shareholder value 

 

we experienced substantial growth through 2008 in our auto segment as pnds became massmarket consumer electronics in both europe and north america this auto pnd market is declining as competing technologies emerged and market saturation occurred navigation technologies have been incorporated into and become more prevalent in competing devices such as mobile handsets tablets and new automobiles through factoryinstalled systems the acceptance by consumers of these alternative solutions has negatively impacted sales and profits in the auto segment there is no assurance that the decline in sales will end and thus no assurance that we can continue to generate profits from the auto segment

 

we have recently been awarded several tierone and tiertwo auto oem supplier contracts to fulfill the associated program commitments we are investing significantly in facilities research and development and other operating expenses and we will continue to do so in the coming years gross margins associated with these auto oem programs are expected to be lower than the gross margins realized in the auto segment and the company as a whole in recent periods if we are not successful in winning additional contract awards or substantially leveraging our investments periods of lower operating income or operating losses in the auto segment could negatively impact total company profits and shareholder value

 

our products may contain undetected security vulnerabilities which could result in damage to our reputation lost revenue diverted development resources and increased warranty claims and litigation  

 

undiscovered vulnerabilities in our products could expose them to hackers or other unscrupulous third parties who develop and deploy viruses and other malicious software programs that could attack our products actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products could harm our reputation and lead some customers to return products to reduce or delay future purchases or use competitive products

 

we collect store process and use personal information and other customer data which subjects us to governmental regulation and other legal obligations related to privacy information security and data protection and our actual or perceived failure to comply with such regulations and obligations could harm our business 

 

we collect store process and use personal information and other user data our users’ personal information may include among other information names addresses phone numbers email addresses payment account information height weight age gender heart rates sleeping patterns gpsbased location and activity patterns due to the volume and types of the personal information and data we manage and the nature of our products and applications the security features of our platform and information systems are critical if our security measures or applications are breached are disrupted or fail unauthorized persons may be able to obtain access to user data if we or our thirdparty service providers business partners or thirdparty apps with which our users choose to share their garmin data were to experience a breach disruption or failure of systems compromising our users’ data or the media suggested that our security measures or those of our thirdparty service providers were insufficient our brand and reputation could be adversely affected use of our products and services could decrease and we could be exposed to a risk of loss litigation and regulatory proceedings depending on the nature of the information compromised in the event of a data breach disruption or other unauthorized access to our user data we may also have obligations to notify users about the incident and we may need to provide some form of remedy for the individuals affected by the incident 

a growing number of legislative and regulatory bodies have adopted consumer notification requirements in the event of unauthorized access to or acquisition of certain types of personal data such breach notification laws continue to evolve and may be inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another complying with these obligations could cause us to incur substantial costs and could increase negative publicity surrounding any incident that compromises user data our users may also accidentally disclose or lose control of their passwords creating the perception that our systems or those of our thirdparty service providers are not secure against thirdparty access additionally if third parties we work with such as vendors business partners service providers or developers violate applicable laws agreements or our policies such violations may also put our users’ information at risk and could in turn have an adverse effect on our business while we maintain insurance coverage that subject to policy terms and conditions and a significant selfinsured retention is designed to address certain aspects of cyber risks such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise in the continually evolving area of cyber risk 

regulatory authorities and legislative bodies around the world including in the united states have enacted or are considering a number of legislative and regulatory proposals concerning data protection in may 2018 the general data protection regulation gdpr went into effect in the eu on january 1 2020 the california consumer privacy act ccpa went into effect and other states in the united states are considering adopting data privacy laws noncompliance with gdpr ccpa or other data protection laws in other states in the united states or in other countries could result in significant fines and penalties in addition the interpretation and application of consumer and data protection laws in the us europe asia latin america and elsewhere are sometimes uncertain and in flux it is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our interpretation and data practices if so in addition to the possibility of fines this could result in an order requiring that we change our data practices which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations complying with these various laws could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business 

 

we rely on information technology systems for our business operations failures or disruptions including security breaches or cyber attacks to our information technology systems may harm our reputation and adversely affect our business and result of operations 

 

our information technology systems allow for our daily business operations to operate efficiently and effectively these systems assist in our business processes including but not limited to communications financial management supply chain management order processing shipping and billing and providing services and support to our customers additionally we electronically maintain sensitive data including intellectual property our proprietary business information and that of our customers and suppliers and some personally identifiable information of our customers and employees in our facilities and on our networks the secure processing maintenance and transmission of this information is important to our operations a disruption to any of these processes can adversely affect our business and results of operations furthermore a breach of our security systems and procedures or those of our vendors could result in significant data losses or theft of our intellectual property as well as our customers or our employees intellectual property proprietary business information or personally identifiable information a cybersecurity breach could negatively affect our competitive position and operating results as a result of theft of our intellectual property and could negatively affect our reputation as a trusted product and service provider by adversely affecting the markets perception of the security or reliability of our products or services 

 

we have technology and processes in place to detect and respond to data security incidents however because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access disable or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently and may be difficult to detect for long periods of time we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventive measures in addition hardware software or applications we develop or procure from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture or other problems that could unexpectedly compromise information security unauthorized parties may also attempt to gain access to our systems or facilities through fraud trickery or other forms of deceiving our customers and employees accordingly we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate security barriers or other preventative measures or if such measures are implemented and even with appropriate training conducted in support of such measures human errors may still occur it is virtually impossible for us to entirely mitigate this risk a party whether internal or external who is able to circumvent our security measures could misappropriate information 

 

actual or anticipated attacks and risks may cause us to incur increasing costs including costs to deploy additional personnel and protection technologies to conduct additional employee training and to engage third party security experts and consultants our technology errors and omissions insurance may not protect against all of the costs liabilities and other adverse effects arising from a security breach or system failure if we fail to reasonably maintain the security of confidential information we may suffer significant reputational and financial losses and our results of operations cash flows financial condition and liquidity may be adversely affected in addition a system breach could result in other negative consequences including disruption of internal operations and may subject us to private litigation government investigations enforcement actions and cause us to incur potentially significant liability damages or remediation costs 

 

gross margins for our products may fluctuate or erode 

 

gross margins in some of our segments are volatile and could decline in the future due to competitive price reductions that are not fully offset by material cost reductions in addition our overall gross margin may fluctuate from period to period due to a number of factors including product mix competition and unit volumes in particular the average selling prices of a specific product tend to decrease over that product’s life to offset such decreases we intend to rely primarily on component cost reduction obtaining yield improvements and corresponding cost reductions in the manufacturing of existing products and on introducing new products that incorporate advanced features and therefore can be sold at higher average selling prices however there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain any such yield improvements or cost reductions or introduce any such new products in the future to the extent that such cost reductions and new product introductions do not occur in a timely manner or our products do not achieve market acceptance our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected

 

changes in our united states federal income tax classification or that of our subsidiaries could result in adverse tax consequences to our 10 or greater us shareholders 

 

the tax cuts and jobs act the “2017 act” signed on december 22 2017 may have changed the consequences to us shareholders that own or are considered to own as a result of the attribution rules ten percent or more of the voting power or value of the stock of a nonus corporation a 10 us shareholder under the us federal income tax law applicable to owners of us controlled foreign corporations “cfcs” 

 

prior to the 2017 act the company did not believe we or any of our nonus subsidiaries were considered a cfc which is a determination made daily based on whether the 10 us shareholders together own or are considered to own as a result of the attribution rules more than fifty percent of the voting power or value of a nonus corporation the 2017 act repealed internal revenue code section 958b4 which unless clarified in future regulations or other guidance may result in classification of certain of the company’s foreign subsidiaries as cfcs with respect to any single 10 us shareholder this may be the result without regard to whether 10 us shareholders together own directly or indirectly more than fifty percent of the voting power or value of the company as was the case under prior rules the repeal is effective as of the last taxable year of cfcs beginning before january 1 2018 and for the taxable year of 10 us shareholders in which the cfcs taxable year ends 

 

additional tax consequences to 10 us shareholders of a cfc may result from other provisions of the 2017 act for example the 2017 act amended section 965 to require 10 us shareholders to include in income their prorata share of certain earnings and profits ep of cfcs this section 965 inclusion is accompanied by a partial dividendsreceived deduction the 2017 act also added section 951a which requires a 10 us shareholder of a cfc to include in income its prorata share of the global intangible lowtaxed income gilti of the cfc finally the 2017 act eliminated the requirement in section 951a necessitating that a foreign corporation be considered a cfc for an uninterrupted period of at least 30 days in order for a 10 us shareholder to have a current income inclusion

 

from time to time the company may elect to employ antidilutive measures such as a stock buyback program these measures could inadvertently create additional 10 us shareholders and thus trigger adverse tax consequences for those shareholders as described above we urge shareholders to consult their individual tax advisers for advice regarding the 2017 act revisions to the us federal income tax law applicable to owners of cfcs given the current uncertainty regarding their scope of applicability

 

some of our products are subject to governmental regulation or certification failure to obtain required certifications of our products on a timely basis either due to government shutdown or other delays in the certification process could harm our business 

 

federal aviation administration faa certification is required for all of our aviation products that are intended for installation in typecertificated aircraft to the extent required certification is an expensive and timeconsuming process that requires significant focus and resources an inability to obtain or excessive delay in obtaining such certifications could have an adverse effect on our ability to introduce new products and for certain aviation oem products our customers’ ability to sell airplanes delays in our obtaining certification for our aviation products have resulted and may in the future result in our being required to pay compensation to our customers additionally failure of the united states congress to appropriate funds for faa operations that results in a shut down of faa operations or furloughing of faa employees due to partial or complete government shutdowns or otherwise could result in delays in the required faa certification of our avionics products and in the production sale and registration of aircraft that use our avionics products therefore such inabilities or delays could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results in addition we cannot assure that our certified products will not be decertified any such decertification could have an adverse effect on our operating results 

 

in addition in accordance with fcc rules and regulations wireless transceiver products are required to be certified by the fcc in the united states and comparable authorities in foreign countries where they are sold garmin’s products sold in europe are required to comply with relevant directives of the european commission a delay in receiving required certifications for new products or enhancements to garmin’s products or losing certification for garmin’s existing products could adversely affect our business 

 

our business may suffer if we are not able to hire and retain sufficient qualified personnel or if we lose our key personnel 

 

our future success depends partly on the continued contribution of our key executive engineering sales marketing manufacturing and administrative personnel we currently do not have employment agreements with any of our key executive officers swiss law prohibits us from paying severance payments to our senior executive officers which may impair our ability to recruit for these positions we do not have key person life insurance on any of our key executive officers and do not currently intend to obtain such insurance the loss of the services of any of our senior level management or other key employees could harm our business recruiting and retaining the skilled personnel we require to maintain and grow our market position may be difficult for example in some recent years there has been a nationwide shortage of qualified engineers in the united states who are necessary for us to design and develop new products and therefore it has sometimes been challenging to recruit such personnel if we fail to hire and retain qualified employees we may not be able to maintain and expand our business 

 

our quarterly operating results are subject to fluctuations and seasonality 

 

our operating results are difficult to predict our future quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly if such operating results decline the price of our stock could decline as we have expanded our operations our operating expenses particularly our research and development costs have increased as a percentage of our sales in some periods if revenues decrease and we continue to increase research and development costs our operating results would be negatively affected 

 

historically our revenues have been lower in the first quarter of each fiscal year as many of our devices are highly consumeroriented and consumer buying is traditionally lower in this quarter sales of certain of our auto fitness marine and outdoor products tend to be higher in our second fiscal quarter due to increased consumer spending for such products in the spring season and travel season sales of many of our consumer products also have been higher in our fourth fiscal quarter due to increased consumer spending patterns on electronic devices during the holiday season   

 

we rely on independent dealers and distributors to sell our products and disruption to these channels would harm our business 

 

because we sell many of our products to independent dealers and distributors we are subject to many risks including risks related to their inventory levels and support for our products in particular our dealers and distributors maintain significant levels of our products in their inventories if dealers and distributors attempt to reduce their levels of inventory or if they do not maintain sufficient levels to meet customer demand our sales could be negatively impacted 

 

many of our dealers and distributors also sell products offered by our competitors if our competitors offer our dealers and distributors more favorable terms those dealers and distributors may deemphasize or decline to carry our products in the future we may not be able to retain or attract a sufficient number of qualified dealers and distributors if we are unable to maintain successful relationships with dealers and distributors or to expand our distribution channels our business will suffer 

 

we may pursue strategic acquisitions investments strategic partnerships or other ventures and our business could be materially harmed if we fail to successfully identify evaluate complete and integrate such transactions 

 

we intend to evaluate acquisition opportunities and opportunities to make investments in complementary businesses technologies services or products or to enter into strategic partnerships with parties who can provide access to those assets additional product or services offerings additional distribution or marketing synergies or additional industry expertise we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition investment or strategic partnership candidates or if we do identify suitable candidates in the future we may not be able to complete those transactions on commercially favorable terms or at all 

 

any past or future acquisition could also result in difficulties assimilating acquired employees operations and products and diversion of capital and management’s attention away from other business issues and opportunities integration of acquired companies may result in problems related to integration of technology and inexperienced management teams due diligence performed prior to closing acquisitions may not uncover certain risks or liabilities that could materially impact our business and financial results in addition the key personnel of the acquired company may decide not to work for us we may not successfully integrate internal controls compliance under the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 the gdpr and other corporate governance and regulatory matters operations personnel or products related to acquisitions we may make in the future if we fail to successfully integrate such transactions our business could be materially harmed 

 

many of our products rely on the global positioning system and other global satellite navigation systems gnss

 

the global positioning system gps is a satellitebased navigation and positioning system consisting of a constellation of orbiting satellites the satellites and their ground control and monitoring stations are maintained and operated by the united states department of defense the department of defense does not currently charge users for access to the satellite signals these satellites and their ground support systems are complex electronic systems subject to electronic and mechanical failures and possible sabotage the satellites were originally designed to have lives of 75 years and are subject to damage by the hostile space environment in which they operate however of the current deployment of satellites in place some have been operating for more than 20 years 

 

to repair damaged or malfunctioning satellites is currently not economically feasible if a significant number of satellites were to become inoperable there could be a substantial delay before they are replaced with new satellites a reduction in the number of operating satellites may impair the current utility of gps and the growth of current and additional market opportunities gps satellites and ground control segments are being modernized gps modernization software updates can cause problems we depend on public access to open technical specifications in advance of gps updates

 

gps is operated by the us government which is committed to maintenance and improvement of gps however if the policy were to change and gps were no longer supported by the us government or if user fees were imposed it could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

 

some of our products also use signals from satellite based augmentation systems sbas that augment gps such as the us wide area augmentation system waas japanese mtsatbased satellite augmentation system msas and european geostationary navigation overlay service egnos any curtailment of sbas operating capability could result in decreased user capability for many of our aviation products thereby impacting our markets

 

some of our products also use satellite signals from the russian glonass system other countries including china and india are in the process of creating their own gnss systems and we either have developed or will develop products which use gnss signals from these systems the european community is developing an independent radio navigation satellite system known as galileo national or european authorities may provide preferential access to signals to companies associated with their markets including our competitors which could harm our competitive position use of nonus gnss signals may also be subject to fcc waiver requirements and to restrictions based upon international trade or geopolitical considerations if we are unable to develop timely and competitive commercial products using these systems or obtain timely and equal access to service signals it could result in lost revenue 

 

any of the foregoing factors could affect the willingness of buyers of our products to select global positioning systembased products instead of products based on competing technologies 

 

our business is subject to disruptions and uncertainties caused by geopolitical instability war or terrorism 

 

acts of war or acts of terrorism especially any directed at the gps signals could have a material adverse impact on our business operating results and financial condition the threat of terrorism and war and heightened security and military response to this threat or any future acts of terrorism may cause a redeployment of the satellites used in gps or interruptions of the system to the extent that such interruptions have an effect on sales of our products this could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition

 

a shut down of airspace or imposition of restrictions on general aviation would harm our business the shutdown of airspace could cause reduced sales of our general aviation products and delays in the shipment of our products manufactured in our taiwan manufacturing facilities to our global distribution facilities thereby adversely affecting our ability to supply new and existing products to our dealers and distributors

 

any reallocation or repurposing of radio frequency spectrum could cause harmful interference with the reception of global positioning system signals this interference could harm our business 

 

our global positioning system technology is dependent on the use of the standard positioning service sps provided by the us government’s gps satellites gps operates in radio frequency bands that are globally allocated for radio navigation satellite services international allocations of radio frequency are made by the international telecommunications union itu a specialized technical agency of the united nations these allocations are further governed by radio regulations that have treaty status and which may be subject to modification every two to three years by the world radio communication conference each country also has regulatory authority on how each band is used in the united states the fcc and the national telecommunications and information administration ntia share responsibility for radio frequency allocations and spectrum usage regulations 

 

any itu or national reallocation of radio frequency spectrum including frequency band segmentation or sharing of spectrum or other modifications of the permitted uses of relevant frequency bands may materially and adversely affect the utility and reliability of our products and have significant negative impacts on our business and our customers 

 

natural disasters catastrophic events or climate change could affect our financial results 

 

natural disasters and extreme weather events such as tsunamis or earthquakes and medical epidemics or pandemics such as covid19 coronavirus disease could occur in a region where we have a manufacturing or warehousing facility which would cause disruptions in our business operations or loss of inventory these events could also have an impact on our suppliers and affect our supply chain if our backup and recovery plans are not sufficient to minimize business disruption and if our insurance is not sufficient to recover the costs associated with these types of events our financial results could be adversely affected

 

climate change can also pose a risk to our business due to evolving regulatory and legislative measures surrounding climate change the us environmental protection agency has begun to regulate greenhouse gas emissions under the authority granted to it under the clean air act at the federal legislative level us congress could pass legislation to adopt some form of federal mandatory greenhouse gas emission reduction such as a nationwide capandtrade program it is also possible that the us congress may pass alternative climate change bills that do not mandate a nationwide capandtrade program and instead focus on promoting renewable energy and energy efficiency such measures could influence mobility and transportation trends which could decrease the demand for certain of our products

 

because it is uncertain what laws and regulations will be enacted we cannot predict the potential impact of such laws and regulations on our future consolidated financial condition results of operations or cash flows

 

risks relating to our shares 

the volatility of our stock price could adversely affect investment in our common shares

 

the market price of our shares has been and may continue to be highly volatile during 2019 the closing price of our shares ranged from a low of 6139 to a high of 9868 a variety of factors could cause the price of our shares to fluctuate perhaps substantially including

 



























 

in addition in recent years the stock market in general and the markets for shares of technology companies in particular have experienced extreme price fluctuations which have often been unrelated to the operating performance of affected companies any such fluctuations in the future could adversely affect the market price of our common shares

 

our officers and directors exert substantial influence over us 

 

as of january 16 2020 members of our board of directors and our executive officers together with their respective immediate family members and entities that may be deemed affiliates of or related to such persons or entities beneficially owned approximately 22 of our outstanding shares accordingly these shareholders may be able to determine the outcome of corporate actions requiring shareholder approval such as mergers and acquisitions and shareholder proposals this level of ownership may have a significant effect in delaying deferring or preventing a change in control of garmin and may adversely affect the voting and other rights of other holders of our common shares

 

the rights of our shareholders are governed by swiss law

 

the rights of our shareholders are governed by swiss law and garmin ltd’s articles of association the rights of shareholders under swiss law differ from the rights of shareholders of companies incorporated in other jurisdictions for example swiss law allows our shareholders acting at a shareholders’ meeting to authorize share capital that can be issued by the board of directors without approval of a shareholders’ meeting but this authorization is limited to 50 of the existing registered share capital and must be renewed at a shareholders’ meeting at least every two years for it to continue to be available additionally subject to specified exceptions including the exceptions described in our articles of association swiss law grants preemptive rights to existing shareholders to subscribe for new issuances of shares and other securities swiss law also does not provide as much flexibility in the various terms that can attach to different classes of shares as the laws of some other jurisdictions swiss law also reserves for approval by shareholders certain corporate actions over which a board of directors would have authority in some other jurisdictions for example swiss law provides that dividends and other distributions must be approved by shareholders at the general meeting of shareholders these swiss law requirements relating to our capital management may limit our flexibility and situations may arise where greater flexibility would have provided substantial benefits to our shareholders

 

we have limited capital reserves from which to make distributions or repurchase shares without subjecting our shareholders to switzerland withholding tax

 

as of december 28 2019 we had chf 5650 million of unappropriated capital contribution reserves available from which the company may make dividend payments or utilize to repurchase shares for which no withholding tax applies at the time this reserve balance has been returned to shareholders through dividends or share repurchases a swiss federal withholding tax of 35 will generally be applicable to any dividends paid to shareholders the withholding tax must be withheld from the gross distribution and paid to the swiss federal tax administration a holder that qualifies for benefits under a double tax treaty may be able to recover partial withholding tax for example a us holder that qualifies for benefits under the convention between the united states of america and the swiss confederation for the avoidance of double taxation with respect to taxes on income may apply for a refund of the tax withheld in excess of the 15 treaty rate or in excess of the 5 reduced treaty rate for qualifying corporate shareholders with at least 10 participation in our voting stock or for a full refund in case of qualified pension funds

 

after we have exhausted our remaining capital contribution reserves by appropriating them for dividends or share repurchases any dividends paid by the company will generally be subject to a swiss federal withholding tax at 35 however there can be no assurance that our shareholders will approve a dividend out of capital contribution reserves or that swiss withholding rules will not be changed in the future or that a change in swiss law will not adversely affect us or our shareholders in particular as a result of distributions out of capital contribution reserves becoming subject to additional corporate law or other restrictions if we are unable to pay a dividend out of capital contribution reserves we may not be able to make distributions without subjecting our shareholders to swiss withholding taxes 

 

under current swiss tax law repurchases of shares for the purposes of capital reduction are treated as a partial liquidation subject to 35 swiss withholding tax on the difference between the par value and the repurchase price however the portion of the repurchase price that is attributed to capital contribution reserves of the shares repurchased will not be subject to the swiss withholding tax therefore repurchase of our own shares further limits the amount of capital reserves available for distributions to shareholders free of swiss withholding taxes no partial liquidation treatment applies and no withholding tax is triggered if the shares are not repurchased for cancellation but held by us as treasury shares to the extent sufficient capital reserves are available however should we not resell such treasury shares within six years and there is not sufficient capital contribution reserves the withholding tax becomes due at the end of the sixyear period

 

there is uncertainty as to our shareholders’ ability to enforce certain foreign civil liabilities in switzerland and taiwan 

 

we are a swiss company and a substantial portion of our assets are located outside the united states particularly in taiwan as a result it may be difficult to effect service of process within the united states upon us in addition there is uncertainty as to whether the courts of switzerland or taiwan would recognize or enforce judgments of united states courts obtained against us predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the united states or any state thereof or be competent to hear original actions brought in switzerland or taiwan against us predicated upon the securities laws of the united states or any state thereof

 

we have certain limitations on our ability to repurchase and hold our own shares

 

under swiss law we have certain limitations on our ability to repurchase and hold our own shares we and our subsidiaries may only repurchase and hold our own shares to the extent that sufficient freely distributable reserves including contributed surplus as determined for swiss tax and statutory purposes are available the aggregate par value of our registered shares held by us and our subsidiaries may not exceed 10 of our registered share capital we may repurchase our registered shares beyond the statutory limit of 10 however if our shareholders have adopted a resolution at a general meeting of shareholders authorizing the board of directors to repurchase registered shares in an amount in excess of 10 and the repurchased shares are dedicated for cancellation any restriction on our ability to repurchase our shares could make our stock less attractive to investors

overview

we are a leading worldwide provider of navigation communications and information devices most of which are enabled by global positioning system or gps technology we operate in five reportable segments which serve the auto aviation fitness marine and outdoor markets our auto reportable segment is comprised of two operating segments auto pnd and auto oem each operating segment offers products through our network of subsidiary distributors and independent dealers and distributors as well as through oems each of the operating segments is managed separately 

 

since our first products were delivered in 1991 we have generated positive income from operations each year and have funded our growth from these profits 

 

critical accounting policies and estimates

general

our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company’s consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the presentation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including those related to customer sales programs and incentives product returns bad debts inventories investments intangible assets income taxes warranty obligations and contingencies and litigation we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions

 

goodwill 

 

we allocate goodwill to reporting units in proportion to the expected benefit from each business combination each of the company’s operating segments auto pnd auto oem aviation fitness marine and outdoor represents a distinct reporting unit goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value these events or circumstances could include a significant change in the operating performance indicators competition or expectations about future market or economic conditions

 

application of the goodwill impairment test requires significant judgment including the identification of reporting units assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units assignment of goodwill to reporting units and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit the fair value of each reporting unit is estimated through the use of a discounted cash flow methodology this analysis requires significant assumptions including discount rate projected future revenues projected future operating margins and terminal growth rates the estimates used to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit change from year to year based on operating results market conditions and other factors changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and goodwill impairment for each reporting unit

unrecognized income tax benefits

 

we recognize liabilities associated with uncertain income tax positions including those related to transfer pricing based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes will be due we recognize the tax benefits from an uncertain tax position only if payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be not required or it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are measured based on the largest amount of benefit that is more likely than not to be realized upon ultimate settlement 

 

assessing uncertain tax positions requires significant judgment including the evaluation of unique facts and circumstances and the interpretation of laws and regulations especially the assessment of pricing analyses that may produce various ranges of outcomes variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our consolidated financial statements

other

 

for further information on the company’s critical accounting policies refer to the discussion in the notes to the consolidated financial statements as indicated in the table below

 



 

accounting terms and characteristics

 

net sales

 

our net sales are primarily generated through sales to our retail partners dealer and distributor network and to original equipment manufacturers oems refer to the revenue recognition discussion in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements we aim to achieve a quick turnaround on orders we receive and we typically ship most orders within 72 hours therefore we believe that backlog information is not material to the understanding of our business 

 

net sales are subject to seasonal fluctuation typically sales of our consumer products are highest in the fourth quarter due to increased demand during the holiday buying season and in the second quarter due to increased demand during the spring and summer season our auto oem and aviation products do not experience much seasonal variation but are more influenced by the timing of auto program manufacturing aircraft certifications  regulatory mandates and the release of new products when the initial demand is typically the strongest 

 

cost of salesgross profit

raw material costs are our most significant component of cost of goods sold our existing practice of performing the design and manufacture of our products inhouse has enabled us to source components from different suppliers and where possible to redesign our products to leverage lower cost components we believe that our flexible production model allows our xizhi jhongli and linkou manufacturing plants in taiwan yangzhou manufacturing plant in china our wassenaar manufacturing plant in the netherlands and our olathe kansas and salem oregon manufacturing plants in the us to experience relatively low costs of manufacturing in general products manufactured in taiwan have been our highest volume products our manufacturing labor costs historically have been lower in taiwan and china than in olathe and salem 

 

sales price variability has had and can be expected to have an effect on our gross profit our gross profit is dependent on segment mix and to a lesser extent product mix within each segment

 

advertising expense

 

our advertising expenses consist primarily of costs for media advertising cooperative advertising with our retail partners point of sale displays and sponsorships 

 

selling general and administrative expenses

 

our selling general and administrative expenses consist primarily of

 

















 

research and development

 

the majority of our research and development costs represent salaries for our engineers and costs of test equipment and components used in product and prototype development 

 

we are committed to increasing the level of innovative design and development of new products as we strive for expanded ability to serve our existing consumer and aviation markets as well as new markets for active lifestyle products 

 

income taxes

we have experienced a relatively low effective income tax rate due to the proportion of our income generated by entities in tax jurisdictions with low statutory rates 

 

 

 

 

 

 

results of operations 

 

the following table sets forth our results of operations as a percentage of net sales during the periods shown the table may not foot due to rounding

 



 

the following table sets forth our results of operations through operating income for each of our five segments during the period shown the company’s codm uses operating income as the measure of profit or loss combined with other measures to assess segment performance and allocate resources operating income represents net sales less costs of goods sold and operating expenses net sales are directly attributed to each segment most costs of goods sold and the majority of operating expenses are also directly attributed to each segment while certain other costs of goods sold and operating expenses are allocated to the segments in a manner appropriate to the specific facts and circumstances of the expenses being allocated for each line item in the table the total of the segments’ amounts equals the amount in the consolidated statements of income data included in item 6

 

as indicated in note 8 to the consolidated financial statements the methodology used to allocate certain selling general and administrative expenses was refined at the beginning of the 2019 fiscal year the amounts presented below for the 52weeks ended december 29 2018 and december 30 2017 are presented here as they were originally reported for comparative purposes we estimate operating income for the 52weeks ended december 29 2018 would have been approximately 18 million less for the aviation segment approximately 11 million more for the marine segment approximately 7 million more for the outdoor segment and not significantly different for the auto and fitness segments we estimate operating income for the 52weeks ended december 30 2017 would have been approximately 14 million less for the aviation segment approximately 8 million less for the fitness segment approximately 8 million more for the marine segment and approximately 7 million more for each of the outdoor and auto segments

 



 

net sales

 



 

net sales increased 12 in 2019 when compared to the yearago period all segments had an increase in revenue except for auto fitness revenue represented the largest portion of our revenue mix in 2019 at 28 compared to 26 in 2018 

 

total unit sales increased 5 to 156 million units in 2019 from 149 million units in 2018

 

fitness outdoor aviation and marine revenues increased 22 13 22 and 15 respectively when compared to the yearago period the fitness segment revenue increase was primarily driven by strong sales in wearables and sales from tacx a newly acquired group of subsidiaries that designs and manufactures indoor bike trainers the outdoor segment revenue increase was driven by sales growth in multiple product categories primarily led by adventure watches aviation segment revenue increases were driven by sales growth in both aftermarket and oem categories marine segment revenue increases were driven by sales growth across multiple product categories primarily chartplotters and sonar products auto segment revenue decreased 14 from the yearago period due to the ongoing auto pnd market contraction and lower auto oem program sales

gross profit

 



 

gross profit dollars in fiscal year 2019 increased 13 while gross margin was slightly higher compared to fiscal year 2018 gross margin increased 410 basis points in the auto segment when compared to the prior year primarily attributable to lower license expense gross margin remained relatively flat within the outdoor marine and aviation segments gross margin decreased in the fitness segment primarily due to lower average selling prices and product mix 

advertising expenses

 



 

advertising expense increased 6 in absolute dollars and was relatively flat as a percent of revenue in fiscal year 2019 compared to fiscal year 2018 the overall increase in absolute dollars was primarily attributable to increased cooperative advertising in the outdoor fitness and marine segments and increased media advertising in the outdoor and fitness segments these increases were partially offset by decreased cooperative advertising expense in the auto and aviation segments all segments were relatively flat as a percent of revenue compared to the prior year

selling general and administrative expenses 

 



 

selling general and administrative expense increased 8 in absolute dollars and was relatively flat as a percent of revenue when compared to the prior year the absolute dollar increase was primarily attributable to personnel costs legal related costs and expenses from recent acquisitions

 

as noted above and in note 8 to the consolidated financial statements the company refined its methodology to allocate certain selling general and administrative expenses at the beginning of the 2019 fiscal year the prior year amounts are presented here as originally reported for comparative purposes we estimate selling general and administrative expenses for fiscal year 2018 would have been approximately 18 million more for the aviation segment approximately 11 million less for the marine segment approximately 7 million less for the outdoor segment and not significantly different for the fitness and auto segments we estimate the selling general and administrative expense for fiscal 2017 would have been approximately 14 million more for the aviation segment approximately 8 million more for the fitness segment approximately 8 million less for the marine segment and approximately 7 million less for each of the outdoor and auto segments 

 

in addition to the change in methodology of allocating certain selling general and administrative expenses noted above marine decreased in fiscal 2019 as a percent of revenue from the previous year due to greater leverage of operating costs

research and development expense

 



 

research and development expense increased 7 in absolute dollars when compared to the yearago period and was relatively flat as a percent of revenue the absolute dollar increase was primarily due to engineering personnel costs related to our wearable and aviation product offerings and expenses resulting from recent acquisitions partially offset by the capitalization of certain contractually reimbursable preproduction design and development personnel costs within the auto segment our research and development spending is focused on product development improving existing software capabilities and exploring new categories

 

operating income 

 



 

total operating income increased 21 in absolute dollars and increased 190 basis points as a percent of revenue when compared to fiscal year 2018 the growth in total operating income on an absolute dollar basis and as a percent of revenue was the result of revenue growth slightly higher gross margin and greater leverage of operating expenses as discussed above 

other income expense

 



 

the average returns on cash and investments including interest and capital gainloss returns during the 52weeks ended december 28 2019 and december 29 2018 were 20 and 18 respectively interest income increased primarily due to slightly higher yields on fixedincome securities

 

foreign currency gains and losses for the company are typically driven by movements in the taiwan dollar euro and british pound sterling in relation to the us dollar the taiwan dollar is the functional currency of garmin corporation the us dollar is the functional currency of garmin europe ltd and the euro is the functional currency of most of our other european subsidiaries although some transactions and balances are denominated in british pounds the majority of the company’s consolidated foreign currency gain or loss is typically driven by the significant cash and marketable securities receivables and payables held in a currency other than the functional currency at a given legal entity due to the relative size of the entities using a functional currency other than the taiwan dollar euro and british pound sterling currency fluctuations related to these entities are not expected to have a material impact on the company’s financial statements

 

the 168 million currency loss recognized in fiscal 2019 was primarily due to the us dollar strengthening against the euro and weakening against the taiwan dollar partially offset by the us dollar weakening against the british pound sterling during fiscal 2019 the us dollar strengthened 23 against the euro and weakened 15 against the taiwan dollar resulting in losses of 93 million and 71 million respectively while the us dollar weakened 29 against the british pound sterling resulting in a gain of 28 million the remaining net currency loss of 32 million was related to the timing of transactions and impacts of other currencies each of which was individually immaterial

 

the 76 million currency loss recognized in fiscal 2018 was primarily due to the strengthening of the us dollar against the euro and the british pound sterling offset by the us dollar strengthening against the taiwan dollar during fiscal 2018 the us dollar strengthened 47 against the euro and 60 against the british pound sterling resulting in losses of 100 million and 17 million respectively while the us dollar strengthened 30 against the taiwan dollar resulting in a gain of 151 million the remaining net currency loss of 110 million was related to the timing of transactions and impacts of other currencies each of which was individually immaterial

 

income tax provision 

 

income tax expense for the fiscal year ended december 28 2019 was 347 million compared to income tax expense of 1292 million for the fiscal year ended december 29 2018 representing a net decrease of 945 million contributing to the decrease in income tax expense was an income tax benefit of 1180 million associated with the revaluation and stepup of certain switzerland tax assets as a result of the october 2019 enactment of switzerland federal and schaffhausen cantonal tax reform and related transitional measures in connection with these transitional measures included in switzerland tax reform a reduced income tax rate will be utilized on certain switzerland taxable income for up to five years 

 

in february 2020 the company initiated a transaction between whollyowned subsidiaries to migrate ownership of certain intellectual property from switzerland to the united states the primary location of research development and executive management the migration which includes a multiyear intercompany license of intellectual property is expected to result in a favorable shift of income mix by jurisdiction and a reduction in expense related to uncertain tax positions during the term of the license agreement this transaction is expected to decrease the company’s effective income tax rate as compared to the fiscal year 2019 effective income tax rate excluding the 1180 million income tax benefit associated with the revaluation and stepup of certain switzerland tax assets as described above the company plans to pursue an advance pricing agreement between relevant jurisdictions related to this transaction at the end of the license agreement a higher percentage of income will be recognized in the united states

 

net income 

 

as a result of the various factors noted above income before taxes increased 20 to 9872 million from 8232 million in the prior year while net income increased 37 to 9525 million from 6941 million in the prior year 

 

liquidity and capital resources

 

as of december 28 2019 we had approximately 26 billion of cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities we primarily use cash flow from operations and expect that future cash requirements may be used to fund our capital expenditures support our working capital requirements pay dividends and fund strategic acquisitions we believe that our existing cash balances and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our short and longterm projected working capital needs capital expenditures and other cash requirements

 

it is management’s goal to invest the onhand cash in accordance with the investment policy which has been approved by the company’s board of directors the investment policy’s primary purpose is to preserve capital maintain an acceptable degree of liquidity and maximize yield within the constraint of low credit risk garmin’s average interest income returns on cash and investments during fiscal 2019 2018 and 2017 were approximately 20 19 and 16 respectively the fair value of our securities varies from period to period due to changes in interest rates in the performance of the underlying collateral and in the credit performance of the underlying issuer among other factors see note 3 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding marketable securities

operating activities

 



 

the 2210 million decrease in cash provided by operating activities in fiscal year 2019 compared to fiscal year 2018 was primarily due to a decrease of cash provided by working capital of 3031 million which included a decrease of 1307 million in net collections of accounts receivable associated primarily with strong fourth quarter sales a net increase of 1124 million in cash paid for inventory associated primarily with the company’s strategy to increase days of supply to support our increasingly diversified product lines and a net increase of 600 million in cash used in other activities primarily driven by payments associated with an amendment to a license agreement and income taxes payable of 694 million the decrease was partially offset by an increase in net income of 2584 million reduced by other noncash adjustments to net income of 1069 million which included an income tax benefit of 1180 million associated with the revaluation and stepup of certain switzerland tax assets 

investing activities 

 



 

the 1432 million increase in cash used in investing activities in fiscal year 2019 compared to fiscal year 2018 was primarily due to increased net cash paid for acquisitions of 2711 million partially offset by a decrease in net purchases of marketable securities of 890 million and decreased cash payments for net purchases of property and equipment of 367 million

financing activities

 



 

the 1299 million increase in cash used in financing activities in fiscal year 2019 compared to fiscal year 2018 was primarily due to an increase in dividend payments of 1211 million associated with the timing of dividend payments that resulted in one more dividend payment in 2019 compared to 2018

 

our declared dividend has increased from 051 per share for the twelve calendar quarters beginning in june 2016 to 057 per share for the four calendar quarters beginning june 2019

contractual obligations and commercial commitments

as of december 28 2019 operating leases comprise the substance of the company’s commercial commitments with longterm scheduled payments as summarized below

 



 

the company is party to certain other commitments which include purchases of raw materials capital expenditures advertising and other indirect purchases in connection with conducting our business the aggregate amount of purchase orders and other commitments open as of december 28 2019 was approximately 5863 million we cannot determine the aggregate amount of such purchase orders that represent contractual obligations because purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements our purchase orders are generally based on our current needs and are typically fulfilled within short periods of time

 

we may be required to make significant cash outlays related to unrecognized tax benefits however due to the uncertainty of the timing of future cash flows associated with our unrecognized tax benefits we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement if any with the respective taxing authorities accordingly unrecognized tax benefits of 1013 million as of december 28 2019 have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above for further information related to unrecognized tax benefits see note 2 – summary of significant accounting policies income taxes and note 6 – income taxes to the consolidated financial statements included in this report

offbalance sheet arrangements

we do not have any offbalance sheet arrangements

tablestart 


 item 7a 

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

tableend

market sensitivity

 

we have market risk primarily in connection with the pricing of our products and services and the purchase of raw materials product pricing and raw materials costs are both significantly influenced by semiconductor market conditions historically during cyclical industry downturns we have been able to offset pricing declines for our products through a combination of improved product mix and success in obtaining price reductions in raw materials costs

 

inflation

 

we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our business financial condition or results of operations if our costs were to become subject to significant inflationary pressures we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs through price increases our inability or failure to do so could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations

foreign currency exchange rate risk

 

the operation of garmin’s subsidiaries in international markets results in exposure to movements in currency exchange rates we have experienced significant foreign currency gains and losses due to the strengthening and weakening of the us dollar the potential of volatile foreign exchange rate fluctuations in the future could have a significant effect on our results of operations the company has not historically used financial instruments to hedge its foreign currency exchange rate risks 

 

the currencies that create a majority of the company’s exchange rate exposure are the taiwan dollar euro and british pound sterling garmin corporation headquartered in taiwan uses the local currency as the functional currency the company translates all assets and liabilities at the rate of exchange in effect at the balance sheet date and income and expense activity at the approximate rate of exchange at the transaction date in order to minimize the effect of the currency exchange fluctuations on our net assets we have elected to retain most of our taiwan subsidiary’s cash and investments in accounts denominated in us dollars 

 

most european subsidiaries use the euro as the functional currency however the functional currency of our largest european subsidiary garmin europe ltd is the us dollar and as some transactions have occurred and balances reside in british pounds sterling or euros foreign currency gains or losses have been realized historically related to the movements of those currencies relative to the us dollar gains and losses may become more material in the future as our european presence grows

 

during fiscal year 2019 the company incurred a net foreign currency loss of 168 million the us dollar strengthening against the euro and weakening against the taiwan dollar was partially offset by the us dollar weakening against the british pound sterling during fiscal 2019 the us dollar strengthened 23 against the euro and weakened 15 against the taiwan dollar resulting in losses of 93 million and 71 million respectively while the us dollar weakened 29 against the british pound sterling resulting in a gain of 28 million the remaining net currency loss of 32 million was related to the timing of transactions and impacts of other currencies each of which was individually immaterial these and other currency moves during fiscal year 2019 also resulted in a currency translation adjustment of 80 million within accumulated other comprehensive income on the company’s consolidated balance sheets 

 

we assessed the company’s exposure to movements in currency exchange rates by performing a sensitivity analysis of adverse changes in exchange rates and the corresponding impact to our results of operations based on monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than respective functional currencies as of december 28 2019 and december 29 2018 hypothetical and reasonably possible adverse changes of 10 for the taiwan dollar euro and british pound sterling would have resulted in an adverse impact on income before income taxes on the company’s consolidated statements of income of approximately 90 and 109 million at december 28 2019 and december 29 2018 respectively

interest rate risk 

 

we have no outstanding longterm debt as of december 29 2018 we therefore have no meaningful debtrelated interest rate risk 

 

we are exposed to interest rate risk in connection with our investments in marketable securities as interest rates change the unrealized gains and losses associated with those securities will fluctuate accordingly 

 

the company’s investment policy targets low risk investments with the objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss the company does not intend to sell securities in an unrealized loss position and it is not more likely than not that the company will be required to sell such investments before recovery of their amortized costs bases which may be maturity during 2019 and 2018 the company did not record any material impairment charges on its outstanding securities

 

we assessed the company’s exposure to interest rate risk by performing a sensitivity analysis of a parallel shift in the yield curve and the corresponding impact to the company’s portfolio of marketable securities based on balance sheet positions as of december 28 2019 and december 29 2018 the hypothetical and reasonably possible 100 basis point increases in interest rates across all securities would have resulted in declines in portfolio fair market value of approximately 35 million and 38 million at december 28 2019 and december 29 2018 respectively such losses would only be realized if the company sold the investments prior to maturity

company overview 

  

for nearly 30 years garmin ltd and subsidiaries together the “company” has pioneered new global positioning system gps navigation and wireless devices and applications that are designed for people who live an active lifestyle garmin serves five primary business units including auto aviation fitness marine and outdoor we believe it is through these business units that garmin is able to achieve synergies in raw material purchases manufacturing distribution research and development and marketing efforts making for a stronger more effective company garmin designs develops manufactures markets and distributes a diverse family of handheld wearable portable and fixedmount gpsenabled products and other navigation communications sensorbased and information products in 2018 garmin celebrated a milestone in delivering its 200 millionth product since the inception of the business and delivered more than 149 million products during the year 

  

overview of the global positioning system 

  

the global positioning system gps is a global navigation satellite system that is able to provide precise geographic location and data to gps receivers the system consists of a constellation of orbiting satellites and provides global coverage access to gps is provided free of charge gps satellites and their ground control and monitoring stations are maintained and operated by the united states department of defense which maintains an ongoing satellite replenishment program to ensure continuous global system coverage 

  

garmin utilizes a variety of other global navigation satellite systems gnss including but not limited to 

       

in certain urban canyon or restricted sky visibility situations the combination of multiple global navigation satellite systems to produce a navigation fix may result in improved accuracy 

  

on a subscription basis certain garmin products offer access to the iridium satellite network a synchronized constellation of 66 low earth orbit leo satellites offering global data communication coverage the iridium network is the only network that spans the entire globe offering 100 percent coverage worldwide to enable satellitebased communication 

 

 

  

the accuracy and utility of gps can be enhanced through augmentation techniques which compute any remaining errors in the signal and broadcast these corrections to a gps device the federal aviation administration “faa” has developed a wide area augmentation system waas comprising ground reference stations and additional satellites that improve the accuracy of gps positioning available in the united states and most of canada and mexico to approximately 3 meters waas supports the use of gps as the primary means of enroute terminal and approach navigation for aviation in the united states the increased accuracy offered by waas also enhances the utility of waasenabled gps receivers for consumer applications

competition 

  

in general we operate in highly competitive markets though competitive conditions do vary among our diverse products and geographies garmin believes the principal competitive factors impacting the market for its products are design functionality quality and reliability customer service brand price timetomarket and availability garmin believes that it generally competes favorably in each of these areas and as such is generally a significant competitor in each of our major markets 

  

garmin believes that its principal competitors for portable automotive products are mitac digital corporation mitac which distributes products under the brand names of magellan mio and navman and tomtom nv garmin believes that its principal competitors for infotainment solutions are alpine electronics inc a subsidiary of alps electric co ltd harman international industries the mitsubishi group and panasonic corporation garmin believes that its principal competitors for outdoor product lines are dogtra company magellan a subsidiary of mitac sportdog brand suunto oy and vista outdoor garmin believes that its principal competitors for fitness products are apple inc bryton corp fitbit inc huami corporation huawei technologies co ltd polar electro oy samsung electronics co ltd sigma sports suunto oy and wahoo fitness for marine products garmin believes that its principal competitors are flir systems inc furuno electronic company the humminbird division of johnson outdoors inc and navico for garmin’s aviation product lines garmin considers its principal competitors to be appareo systems aspen avionics avidyne corporation cmc electronics collins aerospace dynon avionics foreflight genesys aerosystems honeywell aerospace  defense innovative solutions and support inc l3 avionics systems safran sa thales and universal avionics systems corporation 

  

research and development 

  

garmin’s product innovations are driven by its strong emphasis on research and development and the close partnership between garmin’s engineering and manufacturing teams garmin’s products are created by its engineering and development staff which numbered approximately 4200 people worldwide as of december 29 2018 garmin’s manufacturing staff includes manufacturing process engineers who work closely with garmin’s design engineers to ensure manufacturability and manufacturing cost control for its products garmin’s development staff includes industrial designers as well as software engineers electrical engineers mechanical engineers and cartographic engineers garmin believes the industrial design of its products has played an important role in garmin’s success once a development project is initiated and approved a multidisciplinary team is created to design the product and transition it into manufacturing 

  

manufacturing and operations 

  

garmin believes one of its core competencies and strengths is its vertically integrated manufacturing capabilities at its taiwan facilities in xizhi jhongli and linkou its china facility in yangzhou and at its us facilities in olathe kansas and salem oregon garmin believes that its ownership and operation of its own manufacturing facilities and distribution networks provides significant capability and flexibility to address the breadth and depth of resources necessary to serve its diverse products and markets 

 

 

  

specifically garmin believes that its vertical integration of its manufacturing capabilities provides advantages to product cost quality and time to market 

  

cost garmin’s manufacturing resources rapidly and iteratively prototype designs concepts products and processes achieving higher efficiency resulting in lower cost garmin’s vertical integration approach enables leveraging our manufacturing resources across high mid and low volume products sharing of these resources across our product lines favorably affects garmin’s costs to produce its range of products with lower volume products realizing the economies of scale of the high volume products the ownership and integration of our resources allows garmin to optimize the design for manufacturing of our products yielding improved cost 

  

quality garmin’s automation and sophisticated production processes provide inservice robustness and consistent reliability standards that enables garmin to maintain strict process and quality control of the products manufactured thereby improving the overall quality of our products additionally the immediate feedback throughout the manufacturing processes is provided to the development teams providing integrated continuous improvement throughout design and supply chain 

  

time to market garmin uses multidisciplinary teams of design engineers process engineers and supply chain specialists to develop products allowing them to quickly move from concept to manufacturing this integrated ownership provides inherent flexibility to enable faster time to market 

  

garmin’s design manufacturing distribution and servicing processes in its us taiwan china and uk facilities are certified to iso 9001 an international quality standard developed by the international organization for standardization garmin’s automotive operations in taiwan china uk and olathe have achieved iatf 16949 certification a quality standard for automotive suppliers garmin’s olathe and salem aviation operations have achieved certification to as9100 the quality standard for the aviation industry 

  

garmin international inc garmin europe ltd and garmin corporation have also achieved certification of their environmental management systems to the iso 14001 standard recognizing garmin’s systems and processes which minimize or prevent harmful effects on the environment and continually strive to improve its environmental performance 

  

materials 

  

although most components essential to garmin’s business are generally available from multiple sources certain key components are currently obtained by the company from single or limited sources which subjects garmin to supply and pricing risks many of these and other key components that are available from multiple sources including but not limited to nand flash memory dynamic random access memory dram gps chipsets and certain lcds are subject at times to industrywide shortages and commodity pricing fluctuations 

  

garmin and other participants in the personal computer tablet mobile communication aviation electronics and consumer electronics industries also compete for various components with other industries that have experienced increased demand for their products in addition garmin uses some custom components that are not common to the rest of the personal computer tablet mobile communication and consumer electronics industries and new products introduced by the company often utilize custom components available from only one source until garmin has evaluated whether there is a need for and subsequently qualifies additional suppliers when a component or product uses new technologies initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields have matured or manufacturing capacity has increased garmin makes efforts to manage risks in these areas through the use of supply agreements and safety stock for strategically important components nevertheless if garmin’s supply of a key singlesourced component for a new or existing product was delayed or constrained if such components were available only at significantly higher prices or if a key manufacturing vendor delayed shipments of completed products to garmin garmin’s financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected garmin’s business and financial performance could also be adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the original source or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source continued availability of these components at acceptable prices or at all may be affected if those suppliers decided to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet garmin’s requirements 

  

 

  

seasonality 

  

our net sales are subject to seasonal fluctuation sales of our consumer products are generally higher in the fourth quarter due to increased demand during the holiday buying season and to a lesser extent the second quarter due to increased demand during the spring and summer season sales of consumer products are also influenced by the timing of the release of new products our aviation and auto oem products do not experience much seasonal variation but are more influenced by the timing of aircraft certifications and the release of new products when the initial demand is typically the strongest 

  

backlog 

  

there is a relatively short cycle between order and shipment therefore we believe that backlog information is not material to the understanding of our business we typically ship most orders within 72 hours of receipt 

  

intellectual property 

  

our success and ability to compete is dependent in part on our proprietary technology we rely on a combination of patent copyright trademark and trade secret laws as well as confidentiality agreements to establish and protect our proprietary rights in addition garmin often relies on licenses of intellectual property for use in its business for example garmin obtains licenses for digital cartography technology for use in our products from various sources 

  

as of january 10 2019 garmin has been issued over 1170 patents throughout the world and holds more than 800 trademark registrations the duration of patents varies in accordance with the provisions of applicable local law we believe that our continued success depends on the intellectual skills of our employees and their ability to continue to innovate garmin will continue to file and prosecute patent applications when appropriate to attempt to protect garmin’s rights in its proprietary technologies 

  

there is no assurance that our current patents or patents which we may later acquire may successfully withstand any challenge in whole or in part it is also possible that any patent issued to us may not provide us with any competitive advantages or that the patents of others will preclude us from manufacturing and marketing certain products despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights to protect our trade secrets to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others or to defend against claims of infringement or invalidity 

  

regulations 

  

the telecommunications industry is highly regulated and the regulatory environment in which garmin operates is subject to change in accordance with the united states’ federal communications commission fcc rules and regulations wireless transceiver products are required to be certified by the fcc and comparable authorities in foreign countries where they are sold garmin’s products sold in europe are required to comply with relevant directives of the european commission a delay in receiving required certifications for new products or enhancements to garmin’s products or losing certification for garmin’s existing products could adversely affect our business in addition aviation products that are intended for installation in “type certificated aircraft” are required to be certified by the faa its european counterpart the european aviation safety agency and other comparable organizations before they can be used in an aircraft 

  

 

  

because garmin corporation one of the company’s principal subsidiaries is located in taiwan foreign exchange control laws and regulations of taiwan with respect to remittances into and out of taiwan may have an impact on garmin’s operations the taiwan foreign exchange control statute and regulations thereunder provides that all foreign exchange transactions must be executed by banks designated to handle such business by the ministry of finance of taiwan and by the central bank of the republic of china taiwan also referred to as the cbc current regulations favor traderelated foreign exchange transactions consequently foreign currency earned from exports of merchandise and services may now be retained and used freely by exporters while all foreign currency needed for the import of merchandise and services may be purchased freely from the designated foreign exchange banks aside from traderelated foreign exchange transactions taiwan companies and residents may without foreign exchange approval remit outside and into taiwan foreign currencies of up to 50 million and 5 million respectively or their equivalent each calendar year currency conversions within the limits are processed by the designated banks and do not have to be reviewed and approved by the cbc the above limits apply to remittances involving a conversion between taiwan dollars and us dollars or other foreign currencies the cbc typically approves foreign exchange in excess of the limits if a party applies with the cbc for review and presents legitimate business reasons justifying the currency conversion a requirement is also imposed on all enterprises to register all medium and longterm foreign debt with the cbc 

  

environmental matters 

  

garmin’s operations are subject to various environmental laws including laws addressing air and water pollution and management of hazardous substances and wastes substantial noncompliance with applicable environmental laws could have a material adverse effect on our business capital expenditures for environmental controls are included in our normal capital budget 

  

environmental regulation of garmin’s products is increasing many of garmin’s products are subject to laws relating to the chemical and material composition of our products and their energy efficiency garmin is also subject to laws requiring manufacturers to be financially responsible for collection recovery and recycling of wastes from certain electronic products compliance with current environmental laws does not have a material impact on our business but the impact of future enactment of environmental laws cannot yet be fully determined and could be substantial 

  

garmin has implemented multiple environmental management system ems policies in accordance with the international organization for standardization iso 14001 standard for environmental health and safety management garmin’s ems policies set forth practices standards and procedures to ensure compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations at garmin’s kansas headquarters facility garmin’s european headquarters facility and garmin’s taiwan and china manufacturing facilities 

  

garmin continues to strive to reduce our carbon footprint by increasing our environmental sustainability efforts our manufacturing locations have implemented increased recycling processes that keep all obsolete garmin manufactured material from entering the waste stream additionally our new facility in olathe kansas has been constructed with energy efficient considerations including reduced water consumption led lighting and reflective roofing to deflect solar radiation 

  

employees 

  

as of december 29 2018 garmin had approximately 13000 full and parttime employees worldwide of whom approximately 5000 were in north america 5300 were in taiwan 1600 were in europe and 1100 were in other global locations except for some of garmin’s employees in sweden none of garmin’s employees are represented by a labor union and none of garmin’s north american or taiwan employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement garmin considers its employee relations to be positive 

  

 

  




 item 1a risk factors 

  

the risks described below are not the only ones facing our company additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also impair our business operations if any of the following risks occur our business financial condition or operating results could be materially adversely affected 

  

risks related to the company 

  

if we are not successful in the continued development timely manufacture and introduction of new products or product categories demand for our products could decrease to the extent that lost sales and profits from declining segments or product categories are not entirely offset 

  

we expect that a significant portion of our future revenue will continue to be derived from sales of newly introduced products this is particularly important to replace sales and profits lost in declining segments or product categories the market for our products is characterized by rapidly changing technology evolving industry standards and changes in customer needs if we fail to introduce new products or to modify or improve our existing products in response to changes in technology industry standards or customer needs our products could rapidly become less competitive or obsolete we must continue to make significant investments in research and development in order to continue to develop new products enhance existing products and achieve market acceptance for such products however there can be no assurance that development stage products will be successfully completed or if developed will achieve significant customer acceptance 

  

if we are unable to successfully develop and introduce competitive new products and enhance our existing products our future results of operations would be adversely affected our pursuit of necessary technology may require substantial time and expense we may need to license new technologies to respond to technological change these licenses may not be available to us on terms that we can accept or may materially change the gross profits that we are able to obtain on our products we may not succeed in adapting our products to new technologies as they emerge development and manufacturing schedules for technology products are difficult to predict and there can be no assurance that we will achieve timely initial customer shipments of new products the timely availability of these products in volume and their acceptance by customers are important to our future success any future challenges related to new products whether due to product development delays manufacturing delays lack of market acceptance delays in regulatory approval or otherwise could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

  

if we are unable to compete effectively with existing or new competitors our resulting loss of competitive position could result in price reductions fewer customer orders reduced margins and loss of market share 

  

the markets for many of our products are highly competitive and we expect competition to increase in the future some of our competitors have significantly greater financial technical and marketing resources than we do these competitors may be able to respond more rapidly to new or emerging technologies or changes in customer requirements they may also be able to devote greater resources to the development promotion and sale of their products or secure better product positioning with retailers increased competition could result in price reductions fewer customer orders reduced margins and loss of market share our failure to compete successfully against current or future competitors could seriously harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

 

  

maturation or contraction of the market for wearable devices or categories of devices could adversely affect our revenue and profits 

  

we have experienced growth in sales and profits in our outdoor and fitness segments which in recent years have benefited from increased sales of wearable devices if the overall wearable device market declines or categories of devices within the wearable device market decline significantly our business financial condition or operating results could be materially adversely affected 

  

our annual and quarterly financial statements will reflect fluctuations in foreign currency translation 

  

the operation of our subsidiaries in international markets results in exposure to movements in currency exchange rates we have experienced significant foreign currency gains and losses due to the strengthening and weakening of the us dollar relative to certain other currencies the potential of volatile foreign exchange rate fluctuations in the future could have a significant effect on our results of operations we have not historically hedged our foreign currency exchange rate risks 

  

the currencies that typically create a majority of our exchange rate exposure are the taiwan dollar euro and british pound sterling the taiwan dollar is the functional currency of garmin corporation the us dollar is the functional currency of garmin europe ltd and the euro is the functional currency of most of our other european subsidiaries although some transactions and balances are denominated in british pounds other legal entities primarily use the local currency as the functional currency due to the relative size of entities using a functional currency other than the taiwan dollar euro and british pound sterling fluctuations of other currencies are not expected to have a material impact on our financial statements 

  

we translate income and expense activity at the approximate rate of exchange at the transaction date and all assets and liabilities at the rate of exchange in effect at the balance sheet date income and expense activity in a currency other than the us dollar can be impacted by exchange rate variations over time the majority of our consolidated foreign currency gain or loss is typically driven by exchange rate impacts on the significant cash receivables and payables held in a currency other than the functional currency at a given legal entity such gain or loss will create variations in our earnings per share however because there is minimal cash impact caused by such exchange rate variations management will continue to focus on our operating performance before the impact of foreign currency gains and losses 

  

changes in applicable tax laws or resolutions of tax disputes could result in adverse tax consequences to the company 

  

our tax position could be adversely impacted by changes to tax laws tax treaties or tax regulations or the interpretation or enforcement thereof by any tax authority in which we file income tax returns we cannot predict the outcome of any specific legislative proposals legislative proposals are being considered in switzerland that could make significant changes in the corporate tax regime and increase the taxes applicable to us in switzerland switzerland has agreed with the european union eu to execute tax reform by 2019 in exchange for the eu’s waiver of countermeasures a failure to accomplish tax reform in the agreed timeframe may result in the eu member states reasserting countermeasure provisions which could result in additional tax for the company 

  

moreover international taxing standards continue to evolve as a result of the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd recommendations aimed at preventing perceived base erosion and profit shifting by multinational corporations while these recommendations are not changes to tax law the countries where we operate may implement legislation or take unilateral actions which may result in adverse effects to our income tax provision and financial statements   

  

significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes in the ordinary course of our business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain we are regularly under audit by tax authorities although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals the results of an audit or litigation could have a material effect on our income tax provision net income or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made 

  

 

  

changes to trade regulations including trade restrictions sanctions or tariffs could significantly harm our results of operations 

  

a significant portion of our global and us sales are comprised of goods assembled and manufactured in our facilities in taiwan and the people’s republic of china and components for a number of our goods are sourced from suppliers in the people’s republic of china the imposition of additional us or foreign governmental controls regulations that create new or enhanced restrictions on free trade trade sanctions or tariffs particularly those applicable to goods imported from taiwan or the people’s republic of china could have substantial adverse effects on our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

economic regulatory and political conditions and uncertainty could adversely affect our revenue and profits 

  

our revenue and profits depend significantly on general economic conditions and the demand for products in the markets in which we compete we have international operations which make up a significant portion of our total revenue which can present challenges depending on economic and geopolitical conditions on both a global and regional scale economic weakness or constrained consumer and business spending has resulted in periods of decreased revenue and in the future could result in decreased revenue and problems with our ability to manage inventory levels and collect customer receivables in addition financial difficulties experienced by our retailers and oem customers have resulted and could result in the future in significant bad debt writeoffs and additions to reserves in our receivables and could have an adverse effect on our results of operations uncertainty in the geopolitical climate could create trade disputes or increased tariffs which could adversely affect our results of operations 

  

the auto segment which represents approximately 19 of our revenue is expected to continue to decline in 2019 the demand for personal navigation devices pnds has been and continues to be reduced by replacement technologies becoming available on mobile devices and factoryinstalled systems in new autos as well as by market saturation 

  

we experienced substantial growth through 2008 in the auto segment of our business as pnds became massmarket consumer electronics in both europe and north america this market is declining as competing technologies emerged and market saturation occurred gpsnavigation technologies have been incorporated into competing devices such as mobile handsets tablets and new automobiles through factoryinstalled systems many companies are now offering navigation software for these mobile devices the acceptance of this technology by consumers has reduced sales in the auto segment and has reduced profits in some periods navigation systems are also becoming more prevalent as standard andor optional equipment on new automobiles increased navigation penetration on mobile handsets and in new automobiles is expected to cause further declines in sales of our portable navigation devices and could further reduce profits 

  

the united kingdom uk is scheduled to formally leave the european union eu on march 29 2019 the effects of the uk’s withdrawal from the eu are not yet known and the uncertainty creates challenges and risks which could have a material effect on our business and results of operations 

  

the united kingdom uk held a referendum in june 2016 where a majority vote was reached supporting the uk withdrawal from the european union eu commonly referred to as brexit brexit is currently scheduled to occur on march 29 2019 the uk and eu have had ongoing negotiations with respect to the uks withdrawal terms however there is continued uncertainty surrounding the future relationship between the uk and eu barring an approved agreement by parliament the uk will exit the eu on march 29 2019 without a transition plan if the uk withdraws from the eu without a transition plan the uk would lose its tarifffree trade status with other eu members and create customs border issues increased tariffs would apply to both goods imported to and exported from the uk the longterm risks of brexit include economic recessions in the uk and in other european markets raising concerns over currency stability for both the british pound sterling and the euro there is risk that other current eu member states may also consider withdrawal from the eu depending on the eu economy following brexit which would increase the longterm risk of economic recessions in european markets and could result in further currency instability for the euro 

  

 

  

we have operations in the uk including offices and a distribution facility and several eu member states and therefore brexit will impact our operations we have certain measures in place to reduce the impact to our business operations however risks such as slow or inefficient border clearance prolonged economic recession and currency fluctuations could have material adverse effects on our business operations results of operations and financial condition as noted in our other risk factors currency volatility of the british sterling pound and euro could have significant effects on our results of operations if a deal is reached between the uk and the eu the impacts of brexit would have a lesser impact to our financial condition and business operations given the number of different outcomes still possible including delaying the exit or holding a second referendum the impacts of brexit are difficult to determine until specific terms of the withdrawal are reached 

  

if we do not correctly anticipate demand for our products we may not be able to secure sufficient quantities or costeffective production of our products or we could have costly excess production or inventories 

  

we have generally been able to increase or decrease production to meet fluctuations in demand however the demand for our products depends on many factors and may be difficult to forecast we expect that it will become more difficult to forecast demand as we introduce and support a diverse product portfolio as competition in the market for our products intensifies and as the markets for some of our products mature significant unanticipated fluctuations in demand could cause the following problems in our operations 

  

   

   

   

we depend on third party suppliers and licensors some of which are sole source for specific components and map data used in our products our production and business would be seriously harmed if these suppliers are not able to meet our demand and alternative sources are not available or if the costs of components rise 

  

we are dependent on third party suppliers for various components used in our current products some of the components that we procure from third party suppliers include semiconductors and electroluminescent panels liquid crystal displays memory chips batteries and microprocessors the cost quality and availability of components are essential to the successful production and sale of our products some components we use are from sole source suppliers certain applicationspecific integrated circuits incorporating our proprietary designs are manufactured for us by sole source suppliers alternative sources may not be currently available for these sole source components 

  

in the past we have experienced shortages of certain components in addition if there are shortages in supply of components the costs of such components may rise if suppliers are unable to meet our demand for components on a timely basis and if we are unable to obtain an alternative source or if the price of the alternative source is prohibitive our ability to maintain timely and costeffective production of our products would be seriously harmed 

  

 

  

we are also dependent on third party licensors for digital mapping data used in our products there are only a limited number of suppliers of mapping data for some of our products and geographical regions the largest digital map supplier for our auto products is here formerly known as navteq which is majorityowned by a consortium of daimler ag bmw ag and audi ag although we do not foresee difficulty in continuing to license data from here at reasonable pricing due to a long term license agreement with an option to extend through 2028 if we are unable to continue licensing such mapping data from here and other primary suppliers and are unable to obtain an alternative source or if the nature of our relationships with primary suppliers changes detrimentally our ability to supply mapping data for use in our products would be seriously harmed 

   

our intellectual property rights are important to our operations and we could suffer loss if they infringe upon other’s rights or are infringed upon by others 

  

we rely on a combination of patents copyrights trademarks and trade secrets confidentiality provisions and licensing arrangements to establish and protect our proprietary rights to this end we hold rights to a number of patents and registered trademarks and regularly file applications to attempt to protect our rights in new technology and trademarks however there is no guarantee that our patent applications will become issued patents or that our trademark applications will become registered trademarks in addition effective copyright patent and trade secret protection may be unavailable limited or not applied for in certain countries moreover even if approved our patents or trademarks may thereafter be successfully challenged by others or otherwise become invalidated for a variety of reasons thus any patents or trademarks we currently have or may later acquire may not provide us a significant competitive advantage 

  

the value of our products relies substantially on our technical innovation in fields in which there are many patent filings third parties may claim that we or our customers some of whom are indemnified by us are infringing their intellectual property rights for example individuals and groups may purchase intellectual property assets for the purpose of asserting claims of infringement and attempting to extract settlements from us or our customers the number of these claims has increased in recent years and may continue to increase in the future such claims could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition from time to time we receive letters alleging infringement of patents trademarks or other intellectual property rights and we have been and currently are a defendant in lawsuits alleging patent infringement litigation concerning patents or other intellectual property is costly and time consuming we may seek licenses from such parties but they could refuse to grant us a license or demand commercially unreasonable terms such infringement claims could also cause us to incur substantial liabilities and to suspend or permanently cease the use of critical technologies or processes or the production or sale of major products 

  

we may become subject to significant product liability costs 

  

if our products malfunction or contain errors or defects we could be subject to significant liability for personal injury and property damage and under certain circumstances could be subject to a judgment for punitive damages we maintain insurance against accidentrelated risks involving our products however there can be no assurance that such insurance would be sufficient to cover the cost of damages to others or that such insurance will continue to be available at commercially reasonable rates in addition insurance coverage may not cover awards of punitive damages and may not cover the cost of associated legal fees and defense costs which could result in lower margins if we are unable to maintain sufficient insurance to cover product liability costs or if our insurance coverage does not cover the award this could have a materially adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

we have claims and lawsuits against us that may result in adverse outcomes 

  

we are subject to a variety of claims and lawsuits adverse outcomes in some or all of these claims may result in significant monetary damages or injunctive relief that could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business litigation and other claims are subject to inherent uncertainties and the outcomes can be difficult to predict management may not adequately reserve for a contingent liability or we may suffer unforeseen liabilities which could then impact the results of a financial period a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements could occur for the period in which the effect of an unfavorable final outcome becomes probable and reasonably estimable which if not expected could harm our results of operations and financial condition 

  

 

  

our products may contain undetected security vulnerabilities which could result in damage to our reputation lost revenue diverted development resources and increased warranty claims and litigation 

  

undiscovered vulnerabilities in our products could expose them to hackers or other unscrupulous third parties who develop and deploy viruses and other malicious software programs that could attack our products actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products could harm our reputation and lead some customers to return products to reduce or delay future purchases or use competitive products 

  

we collect store process and use personal information and other customer data which subjects us to governmental regulation and other legal obligations related to privacy information security and data protection and our actual or perceived failure to comply with such obligations could harm our business 

  

we collect store process and use personal information and other user data our users’ personal information may include among other information names addresses phone numbers email addresses payment account information height weight age gender heart rates sleeping patterns gpsbased location and activity patterns due to the volume and types of the personal information and data we manage and the nature of our products and applications the security features of our platform and information systems are critical if our security measures or applications are breached disrupted or fail unauthorized persons may be able to obtain access to user data if we or our thirdparty service providers business partners or thirdparty apps with which our users choose to share their garmin data were to experience a breach disruption or failure of systems compromising our users’ data or the media suggested that our security measures or those of our thirdparty service providers were insufficient our brand and reputation could be adversely affected use of our products and services could decrease and we could be exposed to a risk of loss litigation and regulatory proceedings depending on the nature of the information compromised in the event of a data breach disruption or other unauthorized access to our user data we may also have obligations to notify users about the incident and we may need to provide some form of remedy for the individuals affected by the incident a growing number of legislative and regulatory bodies have adopted consumer notification requirements in the event of unauthorized access to or acquisition of certain types of personal data such breach notification laws continue to evolve and may be inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another complying with these obligations could cause us to incur substantial costs and could increase negative publicity surrounding any incident that compromises user data our users may also accidentally disclose or lose control of their passwords creating the perception that our systems or those of our thirdparty service providers are not secure against thirdparty access additionally if third parties we work with such as vendors business partners service providers or developers violate applicable laws agreements or our policies such violations may also put our users’ information at risk and could in turn have an adverse effect on our business while we maintain insurance coverage that subject to policy terms and conditions and a significant selfinsured retention is designed to address certain aspects of cyber risks such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise in the continually evolving area of cyber risk 

  

regulatory authorities and legislative bodies around the world including in the united states have enacted or are considering a number of legislative and regulatory proposals concerning data protection in may 2018 the general data protection regulation gdpr a new data protection regulation went into effect in the eu noncompliance with gdpr could result in significant fines and penalties in addition the interpretation and application of consumer and data protection laws in the us europe asia latin america and elsewhere are sometimes uncertain and in flux it is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our interpretation and data practices if so in addition to the possibility of fines this could result in an order requiring that we change our data practices which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations complying with these various laws could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business 

  

 

  

we rely on information technology systems for our business operations failures or disruptions including security breaches or cyber attacks to our information technology systems may harm our reputation and adversely affect our business and result of operations 

  

our information technology systems allow for our daily business operations to operate efficiently and effectively these systems assist in our business processes including but not limited to communications financial management supply chain management order processing shipping and billing and providing services and support to our customers additionally we electronically maintain sensitive data including intellectual property our proprietary business information and that of our customers and suppliers and some personally identifiable information of our customers and employees in our facilities and on our networks the secure processing maintenance and transmission of this information is important to our operations a disruption to any of these processes can adversely affect our business and results of operations furthermore a breach of our security systems and procedures or those of our vendors could result in significant data losses or theft of our intellectual property as well as our customers’ or our employees’ intellectual property proprietary business information or personally identifiable information a cybersecurity breach could negatively affect our competitive position and operating results as a result of theft of our intellectual property and could negatively affect our reputation as a trusted product and service provider by adversely affecting the market’s perception of the security or reliability of our products or services 

  

we have technology and processes in place to detect and respond to data security incidents however because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access disable or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently and may be difficult to detect for long periods of time we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventive measures in addition hardware software or applications we develop or procure from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture or other problems that could unexpectedly compromise information security unauthorized parties may also attempt to gain access to our systems or facilities through fraud trickery or other forms of deceiving our customers and employees accordingly we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate security barriers or other preventative measures or if such measures are implemented and even with appropriate training conducted in support of such measures human errors may still occur it is virtually impossible for us to entirely mitigate this risk a party whether internal or external who is able to circumvent our security measures could misappropriate information 

  

actual or anticipated attacks and risks may cause us to incur increasing costs including costs to deploy additional personnel and protection technologies to conduct additional employee training and to engage third party security experts and consultants our technology errors and omissions insurance may not protect against all of the costs liabilities and other adverse effects arising from a security breach or system failure if we fail to reasonably maintain the security of confidential information we may suffer significant reputational and financial losses and our results of operations cash flows financial condition and liquidity may be adversely affected in addition a system breach could result in other negative consequences including disruption of internal operations and may subject us to private litigation government investigations enforcement actions and cause us to incur potentially significant liability damages or remediation costs 

 

 

  

gross margins for our products may fluctuate or erode 

  

gross margins in some of our segments are volatile and could decline in the future due to competitive price reductions that are not fully offset by material cost reductions in addition our overall gross margin may fluctuate from period to period due to a number of factors including product mix competition and unit volumes in particular the average selling prices of a specific product tend to decrease over that product’s life to offset such decreases we intend to rely primarily on component cost reduction obtaining yield improvements and corresponding cost reductions in the manufacturing of existing products and on introducing new products that incorporate advanced features and therefore can be sold at higher average selling prices however there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain any such yield improvements or cost reductions or introduce any such new products in the future to the extent that such cost reductions and new product introductions do not occur in a timely manner or our products do not achieve market acceptance our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

  

we may experience unique economic and political risks associated with companies that operate in taiwan 

  

our principal manufacturing facilities where we manufacture most of our consumer products are located in taiwan relations between taiwan and the people’s republic of china also referred to as the prc and other factors affecting the political or economic conditions of taiwan in the future could materially affect our business financial condition and results of operations and the market price and the liquidity of our shares 

  

the prc asserts sovereignty over all of china including taiwan certain other islands and all of mainland china the prc government does not recognize the legitimacy of the taiwan government although significant economic and cultural relations have been established during recent years between taiwan and the prc the prc government has indicated that it may use military force to gain control over taiwan in certain circumstances such as the declaration of independence by taiwan the united states’ relations with taiwan are governed by the 1979 taiwan relations act which signifies when the us switched diplomatic recognition from taiwan to the prc referred to as the “onechina” policy deviations from the “onechina” policy could lead to adverse changes in chinaus and chinataiwan relations and could adversely affect our operations in taiwan in the future 

  

changes in our united states federal income tax classification or that of our subsidiaries could result in adverse tax consequences to our 10 or greater us shareholders 

  

the tax cuts and jobs act the “2017 act” signed on december 22 2017 may have changed the consequences to us shareholders that own or are considered to own as a result of the attribution rules ten percent or more of the voting power or value of the stock of a nonus corporation a 10 us shareholder under the us federal income tax law applicable to owners of us controlled foreign corporations “cfcs” 

  

prior to the 2017 act the company did not believe we or any of our nonus subsidiaries were considered a cfc which is a determination made daily based on whether the 10 us shareholders together own or are considered to own as a result of the attribution rules more than fifty percent of the voting power or value of a nonus corporation the 2017 act repealed internal revenue code section 958b4 which unless clarified in future regulations or other guidance may result in classification of certain of the company’s foreign subsidiaries as cfcs with respect to any single 10 us shareholder this may be the result without regard to whether 10 us shareholders together own directly or indirectly more than fifty percent of the voting power or value of the company as was the case under prior rules the repeal is effective as of the last taxable year of cfcs beginning before january 1 2018 and for the taxable year of 10 us shareholders in which the cfcs’ taxable year ends 

  

additional tax consequences to 10 us shareholders of a cfc may result from other provisions of the 2017 act for example the 2017 act amended section 965 to require 10 us shareholders to include in income their prorata share of certain earnings and profits ep of cfcs this section 965 inclusion is accompanied by a partial dividendsreceived deduction the 2017 act also added section 951a which requires a 10 us shareholder of a cfc to include in income its prorata share of the global intangible lowtaxed income gilti of the cfc finally the 2017 act eliminated the requirement in section 951a necessitating that a foreign corporation be considered a cfc for an uninterrupted period of at least 30 days in order for a 10 us shareholder to have a current income inclusion 

  

 

  

from time to time the company may elect to employ antidilutive measures such as a stock buyback program these measures could inadvertently create additional 10 us shareholders and thus trigger adverse tax consequences for those shareholders as described above we urge shareholders to consult their individual tax advisers for advice regarding the 2017 act revisions to the us federal income tax law applicable to owners of cfcs given the current uncertainty regarding their scope of applicability 

  

some of our products are subject to governmental regulation or certification failure to obtain required certifications of our products on a timely basis either due to government shutdown or other delays in the certification process could harm our business 

  

federal aviation administration faa certification is required for all of our aviation products that are intended for installation in typecertificated aircraft to the extent required certification is an expensive and timeconsuming process that requires significant focus and resources an inability to obtain or excessive delay in obtaining such certifications could have an adverse effect on our ability to introduce new products and for certain aviation oem products our customers’ ability to sell airplanes delays in our obtaining certification for our aviation products have resulted and may in the future result in our being required to pay compensation to our customers additionally failure of the united states congress to appropriate funds for faa operations that results in a shut down of faa operations or furloughing of faa employees due to partial or complete government shutdowns or otherwise could result in delays in the required faa certification of our avionics products and in the production sale and registration of aircraft that use our avionics products therefore such inabilities or delays could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results in addition we cannot assure that our certified products will not be decertified any such decertification could have an adverse effect on our operating results 

  

in addition in accordance with fcc rules and regulations wireless transceiver products are required to be certified by the fcc in the united states and comparable authorities in foreign countries where they are sold garmin’s products sold in europe are required to comply with relevant directives of the european commission a delay in receiving required certifications for new products or enhancements to garmin’s products or losing certification for garmin’s existing products could adversely affect our business 

  

our business may suffer if we are not able to hire and retain sufficient qualified personnel or if we lose our key personnel 

  

our future success depends partly on the continued contribution of our key executive engineering sales marketing manufacturing and administrative personnel we currently do not have employment agreements with any of our key executive officers swiss law prohibits us from paying severance payments to our senior executive officers which may impair our ability to recruit for these positions we do not have key person life insurance on any of our key executive officers and do not currently intend to obtain such insurance the loss of the services of any of our senior level management or other key employees could harm our business recruiting and retaining the skilled personnel we require to maintain and grow our market position may be difficult for example in some recent years there has been a nationwide shortage of qualified engineers in the united states who are necessary for us to design and develop new products and therefore it has sometimes been challenging to recruit such personnel if we fail to hire and retain qualified employees we may not be able to maintain and expand our business 

  

our quarterly operating results are subject to fluctuations and seasonality 

  

our operating results are difficult to predict our future quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly if such operating results decline the price of our stock could decline as we have expanded our operations our operating expenses particularly our research and development costs have increased as a percentage of our sales in some periods if revenues decrease and we continue to increase research and development costs our operating results would be negatively affected 

 

 

  

historically our revenues have been weaker in the first quarter of each fiscal year as many of our devices are highly consumeroriented and consumer buying is traditionally lower in this quarter sales of certain of our fitness outdoor marine and automotive products tend to be higher in our second fiscal quarter due to increased consumer spending for such products in the spring season and travel season sales of many of our consumer products also have been higher in our fourth fiscal quarter due to increased consumer spending patterns on electronic devices during the holiday season in addition we attempt to time our new product releases to coincide with relatively higher consumer spending in the second and fourth fiscal quarters which contributes to these seasonal variations 

  

we rely on independent dealers and distributors to sell our products and disruption to these channels would harm our business 

  

because we sell many of our products to independent dealers and distributors we are subject to many risks including risks related to their inventory levels and support for our products in particular our dealers and distributors maintain significant levels of our products in their inventories if dealers and distributors attempt to reduce their levels of inventory or if they do not maintain sufficient levels to meet customer demand our sales could be negatively impacted 

  

many of our dealers and distributors also sell products offered by our competitors if our competitors offer our dealers and distributors more favorable terms those dealers and distributors may deemphasize or decline to carry our products in the future we may not be able to retain or attract a sufficient number of qualified dealers and distributors if we are unable to maintain successful relationships with dealers and distributors or to expand our distribution channels our business will suffer 

  

we may pursue strategic acquisitions investments strategic partnerships or other ventures and our business could be materially harmed if we fail to successfully identify evaluate complete and integrate such transactions 

  

we intend to evaluate acquisition opportunities and opportunities to make investments in complementary businesses technologies services or products or to enter into strategic partnerships with parties who can provide access to those assets additional product or services offerings additional distribution or marketing synergies or additional industry expertise we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition investment or strategic partnership candidates or if we do identify suitable candidates in the future we may not be able to complete those transactions on commercially favorable terms or at all 

  

any past or future acquisition could also result in difficulties assimilating acquired employees operations and products and diversion of capital and management’s attention away from other business issues and opportunities integration of acquired companies may result in problems related to integration of technology and inexperienced management teams due diligence performed prior to closing acquisitions may not uncover certain risks or liabilities that could materially impact our business and financial results in addition the key personnel of the acquired company may decide not to work for us we may not successfully integrate internal controls compliance under the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 the gdpr and other corporate governance and regulatory matters operations personnel or products related to acquisitions we may make in the future if we fail to successfully integrate such transactions our business could be materially harmed 

  

there is uncertainty as to our shareholders’ ability to enforce certain foreign civil liabilities in switzerland and taiwan 

  

we are a swiss company and a substantial portion of our assets are located outside the united states particularly in taiwan as a result it may be difficult to effect service of process within the united states upon us in addition there is uncertainty as to whether the courts of switzerland or taiwan would recognize or enforce judgments of united states courts obtained against us predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the united states or any state thereof or be competent to hear original actions brought in switzerland or taiwan against us predicated upon the securities laws of the united states or any state thereof 

  

 

  

many of our products rely on the global positioning system and other global satellite navigation systems gnss 

  

the global positioning system gps is a satellitebased navigation and positioning system consisting of a constellation of orbiting satellites the satellites and their ground control and monitoring stations are maintained and operated by the united states department of defense the department of defense does not currently charge users for access to the satellite signals these satellites and their ground support systems are complex electronic systems subject to electronic and mechanical failures and possible sabotage the satellites were originally designed to have lives of 75 years and are subject to damage by the hostile space environment in which they operate however of the current deployment of satellites in place some have been operating for more than 20 years 

  

to repair damaged or malfunctioning satellites is currently not economically feasible if a significant number of satellites were to become inoperable there could be a substantial delay before they are replaced with new satellites a reduction in the number of operating satellites may impair the current utility of the gps system and the growth of current and additional market opportunities gps satellites and ground control segments are being modernized gps modernization software updates can cause problems we depend on public access to open technical specifications in advance of gps updates 

  

gps is operated by the us government which is committed to maintenance and improvement of gps however if the policy were to change and gps were no longer supported by the us government or if user fees were imposed it could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

some of our products also use signals from satellite based augmentation systems sbas that augment gps such as the us wide area augmentation system waas japanese mtsatbased satellite augmentation system msas and european geostationary navigation overlay service egnos any curtailment of sbas operating capability could result in decreased user capability for many of our aviation products thereby impacting our markets 

  

some of our products also use satellite signals from the russian glonass system other countries including china and india are in the process of creating their own gnss systems and we either have developed or will develop products which use gnss signals from these systems the european community is developing an independent radio navigation satellite system known as galileo national or european authorities may provide preferential access to signals to companies associated with their markets including our competitors which could harm our competitive position use of nonus gnss signals may also be subject to fcc waiver requirements and to restrictions based upon international trade or geopolitical considerations if we are unable to develop timely and competitive commercial products using these systems or obtain timely and equal access to service signals it could result in lost revenue 

  

any of the foregoing factors could affect the willingness of buyers of our products to select global positioning systembased products instead of products based on competing technologies 

  

our business is subject to disruptions and uncertainties caused by geopolitical instability war or terrorism 

  

acts of war or acts of terrorism especially any directed at the gps signals could have a material adverse impact on our business operating results and financial condition the threat of terrorism and war and heightened security and military response to this threat or any future acts of terrorism may cause a redeployment of the satellites used in gps or interruptions of the system to the extent that such interruptions have an effect on sales of our products this could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

 

  

a shut down of airspace or imposition of restrictions on general aviation would harm our business the shutdown of airspace could cause reduced sales of our general aviation products and delays in the shipment of our products manufactured in our taiwan manufacturing facilities to our global distribution facilities thereby adversely affecting our ability to supply new and existing products to our dealers and distributors 

  

any reallocation or repurposing of radio frequency spectrum could cause harmful interference with the reception of global positioning system signals this interference could harm our business 

  

our global positioning system technology is dependent on the use of the standard positioning service sps provided by the us government’s global positioning system satellites the global positioning system operates in radio frequency bands that are globally allocated for radio navigation satellite services international allocations of radio frequency are made by the international telecommunications union itu a specialized technical agency of the united nations these allocations are further governed by radio regulations that have treaty status and which may be subject to modification every two to three years by the world radio communication conference each country also has regulatory authority on how each band is used in the united states the fcc and the national telecommunications and information administration ntia share responsibility for radio frequency allocations and spectrum usage regulations 

  

any itu or national reallocation of radio frequency spectrum including frequency band segmentation or sharing of spectrum or other modifications of the permitted uses of relevant frequency bands may materially and adversely affect the utility and reliability of our products and have significant negative impacts on our business and our customers 

  

natural disasters catastrophic events or climate change could affect our financial results 

  

natural disasters and extreme weather events such as tsunamis or earthquakes could occur in a region where we have a manufacturing or warehousing facility which would cause disruptions in our business operations or loss of inventory if our backup and recovery plans are not sufficient to minimize business disruption andor if our insurance is not sufficient to recover the costs associated with these types of events our financial results could be adversely affected 

  

climate change can also pose a risk to our business due to evolving regulatory and legislative measures surrounding climate change the environmental protection agency has begun to regulate greenhouse gas emissions under the authority granted to it under the clean air act at the federal legislative level congressional passage of legislation adopting some form of federal mandatory greenhouse gas emission reduction such as a nationwide capandtrade program does not appear likely at this time although it could be adopted at a future date it is also possible that the us congress may pass alternative climate change bills that do not mandate a nationwide capandtrade program and instead focus on promoting renewable energy and energy efficiency which could increase the cost of doing business 

  

because it is uncertain what laws and regulations will be enacted we cannot predict the potential impact of such laws and regulations on our future consolidated financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

 

risks relating to our shares 

  

the volatility of our stock price could adversely affect investment in our common shares 

  

the market price of our shares has been and may continue to be highly volatile during 2018 the closing price of our shares ranged from a low of 5766 to a high of 7005 a variety of factors could cause the price of our shares to fluctuate perhaps substantially including 

  

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

in addition in recent years the stock market in general and the markets for shares of technology companies in particular have experienced extreme price fluctuations which have often been unrelated to the operating performance of affected companies any such fluctuations in the future could adversely affect the market price of our common shares 

 

our officers and directors exert substantial influence over us 

  

as of january 17 2019 members of our board of directors and our executive officers together with members of their families and entities that may be deemed affiliates of or related to such persons or entities beneficially owned approximately 3179 of our outstanding shares accordingly these shareholders may be able to determine the outcome of corporate actions requiring shareholder approval such as mergers and acquisitions and shareholder proposals this level of ownership may have a significant effect in delaying deferring or preventing a change in control of garmin and may adversely affect the voting and other rights of other holders of our common shares 

  

the rights of our shareholders are governed by swiss law 

  

the rights of our shareholders are governed by swiss law and garmin ltd’s articles of association the rights of shareholders under swiss law differ from the rights of shareholders of companies incorporated in other jurisdictions for example swiss law allows our shareholders acting at a shareholders’ meeting to authorize share capital that can be issued by the board of directors without approval of a shareholders’ meeting but this authorization is limited to 50 of the existing registered share capital and must be renewed at a shareholders’ meeting at least every two years for it to continue to be available additionally subject to specified exceptions including the exceptions described in our articles of association swiss law grants preemptive rights to existing shareholders to subscribe for new issuances of shares and other securities swiss law also does not provide as much flexibility in the various terms that can attach to different classes of shares as the laws of some other jurisdictions swiss law also reserves for approval by shareholders certain corporate actions over which a board of directors would have authority in some other jurisdictions for example swiss law provides that dividends and other distributions must be approved by shareholders at the general meeting of shareholders these swiss law requirements relating to our capital management may limit our flexibility and situations may arise where greater flexibility would have provided substantial benefits to our shareholders 

 

 

  

we have limited capital reserves from which to make distributions or repurchase shares without subjecting our shareholders swiss withholding tax 

  

if we are unable to make distributions if any through a reduction of par value or to pay dividends if any out of qualifying capital contribution reserves then any dividends paid by us will generally be subject to a swiss federal withholding tax at a rate of 35 over the long term the amount of par value and qualifying capital contribution reserves available for us to use for par value reductions or dividends will be limited the withholding tax must be withheld from the gross distribution and paid to the swiss federal tax administration a us holder that qualifies for benefits under the convention between the united states of america and the swiss confederation for the avoidance of double taxation with respect to taxes on income may apply for a refund of the tax withheld in excess of the 15 treaty rate or in excess of the 5 reduced treaty rate for qualifying corporate shareholders with at least 10 participation in our voting stock or for a full refund in case of qualified pension funds however there can be no assurance that our shareholders will approve a reduction in par value or a dividend out of qualifying capital contribution reserves that we will be able to meet the other legal requirements for a reduction in par value or that swiss withholding rules will not be changed in the future or that a change in swiss law will not adversely affect us or our shareholders in particular as a result of distributions out of qualifying capital contribution reserves becoming subject to additional corporate law or other restrictions if we are unable to make a distribution through a reduction in par value or to pay a dividend out of qualifying capital contribution reserves we may not be able to make distributions without subjecting our shareholders to swiss withholding taxes 

  

under current swiss tax law repurchases of shares for the purposes of capital reduction are treated as a partial liquidation subject to 35 swiss withholding tax on the difference between the par value and the repurchase price however the portion of the repurchase price that is attributed to qualifying capital contribution reserves of the shares repurchased will not be subject to the swiss withholding tax therefore repurchase of our own shares further limits the amount of qualifying capital reserves available for distributions to shareholders free of swiss withholding taxes no partial liquidation treatment applies and no withholding tax is triggered if the shares are not repurchased for cancellation but held by us as treasury shares to the extent sufficient qualifying capital reserves are available however should we not resell such treasury shares within six years and there is not sufficient qualifying capital contribution reserves the withholding tax becomes due at the end of the sixyear period 

  

we may follow a share repurchase process for future share repurchases if any similar to a “second trading line” on the six swiss exchange in which swiss institutional investors buy shares on the open market and sell these shares to us and are generally able to receive a refund of the swiss withholding tax however if we are unable to use this process successfully we may not be able to repurchase shares for the purposes of capital reduction without subjecting our shareholders to swiss withholding taxes if and to the extent that the repurchase of shares is made out of retained earnings or other taxable reserves no withholding tax would be applicable if and to the extent that qualifying capital contribution reserves are attributable to the share repurchase 

  

we have certain limitations on our ability to repurchase and hold our own shares 

  

under swiss law we have certain limitations on our ability to repurchase and hold our own shares we and our subsidiaries may only repurchase and hold our own shares to the extent that sufficient freely distributable reserves including contributed surplus as determined for swiss tax and statutory purposes are available the aggregate par value of our registered shares held by us and our subsidiaries may not exceed 10 of our registered share capital we may repurchase our registered shares beyond the statutory limit of 10 however if our shareholders have adopted a resolution at a general meeting of shareholders authorizing the board of directors to repurchase registered shares in an amount in excess of 10 and the repurchased shares are dedicated for cancellation our ability to repurchase and hold our own shares has been a component of our capital management and shareholder return practices and any restriction on our ability to repurchase our shares could make our stock less attractive to investors

overview 

  

we are a leading worldwide provider of navigation communications and information devices most of which are enabled by global positioning system or gps technology we operate in five business segments which serve the marine outdoor fitness auto and aviation markets our segments offer products through our network of subsidiary distributors and independent dealers and distributors however the nature of products and types of customers for the five segments can vary significantly as such the segments are managed separately 

  

since our first products were delivered in 1991 we have generated positive income from operations each year and have funded our growth from these profits 

  

critical accounting policies and estimates 

  

general 

  

garmin’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon garmin’s consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the presentation of these financial statements requires garmin to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis garmin evaluates its estimates including those related to customer sales programs and incentives product returns bad debts inventories investments intangible assets income taxes warranty obligations and contingencies and litigation garmin bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

  

 

  

for information on each of the following critical accounting policies andor estimates refer to the discussion in the notes to the consolidated financial statements as indicated in the table below 

  

  

accounting terms and characteristics 

  

net sales 

  

our net sales are primarily generated through sales to our retail partners dealer and distributor network and to original equipment manufacturers refer to the revenue recognition discussion in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements we aim to achieve a quick turnaround on orders we receive and we typically ship most orders within 72 hours therefore we believe that backlog information is not material to the understanding of our business 

  

net sales are subject to seasonal fluctuation typically sales of our consumer products are highest in the fourth quarter due to increased demand during the holiday buying season and in the second quarter due to increased demand during the spring and summer season our aviation and auto oem products do not experience much seasonal variation but are more influenced by the timing of aircraft certifications and the release of new products when the initial demand is typically the strongest 

  

cost of salesgross profit 

  

raw material costs are our most significant component of cost of goods sold our existing practice of performing the design and manufacture of our products inhouse has enabled us to source components from different suppliers and where possible to redesign our products to leverage lower cost components we believe that our flexible production model allows our xizhi jhongli and linkou manufacturing plants in taiwan yangzhou manufacturing plant in china and our olathe kansas and salem oregon manufacturing plants in the us to experience relatively low costs of manufacturing in general products manufactured in taiwan have been our highest volume products our manufacturing labor costs historically have been lower in taiwan and china than in olathe and salem 

  

sales price variability has had and can be expected to have an effect on our gross profit our gross profit is dependent on segment mix and to a lesser extent product mix within each segment 

  

advertising expense 

  

our advertising expenses consist of costs for media advertising cooperative advertising with our retail partners point of sale displays and sponsorships 

  

 

  

selling general and administrative expenses 

  

our selling general and administrative expenses consist primarily of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

research and development 

  

the majority of our research and development costs represent salaries for our engineers and costs of test equipment and components used in product and prototype development 

  

we are committed to increasing the level of innovative design and development of new products as we strive for expanded ability to serve our existing consumer and aviation markets as well as new markets for active lifestyle products 

  

income taxes 

  

we have experienced a relatively low effective corporate tax rate due to the proportion of our revenue generated by entities in tax jurisdictions with low statutory rates in particular the profit entitlement afforded our swissbased companies based on their intellectual property rights ownership of our consumer products have contributed to our relatively low effective corporate tax rate 

  

results of operations 

  

the following table sets forth our results of operations as a percentage of net sales during the periods shown the table may not foot due to rounding 

  

 

  

 

  

the following table sets forth our results of operations through operating income for each of our five segments during the period shown the company’s codm uses operating income as the measure of profit or loss to assess segment performance and allocate resources operating income represents net sales less costs of goods sold and operating expenses net sales are directly attributed to each segment most costs of goods sold and the majority of operating expenses are also directly attributed to each segment while certain other costs of goods sold and operating expenses are allocated to the segments in a manner appropriate to the specific facts and circumstances of the expenses being allocated for each line item in the table the total of the segments’ amounts equals the amount in the consolidated statements of income data included in item 6 

  

   

comparison of 52weeks ended december 29 2018 and december 30 2017 

  

net sales 

  

   

 

  

net sales increased 7 in 2018 when compared to the yearago period all segments had an increase in revenue except for auto fitness revenue represented the largest portion of our revenue mix in 2018 at 26 and auto revenue represented the largest portion of our revenue mix in 2017 at 25 

  

total unit sales decreased 3 to 149 million units in 2018 from 154 million units in 2017 

  

outdoor fitness marine and aviation revenues increased 16 13 18 and 20 respectively when compared to the yearago period the outdoor and fitness segment revenue increases were primarily driven by growth in wearables marine segment revenue increases were driven by sales growth across most product lines and sales from recent acquisitions aviation segment revenue increases were driven by sales growth across most product lines in both oem and aftermarket categories auto segment revenue decreased 19 from the yearago period primarily due to the ongoing pnd market contraction and lower yearoveryear oem sales driven by the timing of oem programs 

  

cost of goods sold 

  

   

cost of goods sold increased 3 in absolute dollars for fiscal year 2018 when compared to fiscal year 2017 the increase in revenue outpaced the increase in cost of goods sold which resulted in a 150 basis point decrease in cost of goods sold as a percent of revenue compared to the prior fiscal year 

  

the marine segment decrease in cost of goods sold as a percent of revenue primarily resulted from the favorable impact of higher margin cartography sales on product mix the outdoor segment decrease in cost of goods sold as a percent of revenue was primarily due to shifts in product mix in the fitness and aviation segments cost of goods sold as a percent of revenue was relatively flat compared to the prior year the auto segment cost of goods decline was largely consistent with the segment revenue decline 

  

gross profit 

  

   

gross profit dollars in 2018 increased 10 while gross margin increased 150 basis points when compared to the prior year gross margin increased in the outdoor and marine segments as a result of the reasons discussed above gross margins remained relatively flat as a percent of revenue in the fitness auto and aviation segments 

  

 

  

advertising expenses 

  

   

advertising expense decreased 6 in absolute dollars and was relatively flat as a percent of revenue in fiscal year 2018 compared to fiscal year 2017 the overall decrease in absolute dollars was primarily attributable to decreased media advertising in the fitness segment and decreased media and cooperative advertising in the auto segment partially offset by increased media advertising in the outdoor segment and increased media and cooperative advertising in the marine segment 

  

selling general and administrative expenses 

  

   

selling general and administrative expense increased 9 in absolute dollars and was relatively flat as a percent of revenue when compared to the yearago period the absolute dollar increase was primarily attributable to expenses from recent acquisitions and personnel costs partially offset by a reduction in litigation settlement costs in the marine segment all segments were relatively flat as a percent of revenue 

  

research and development expense 

  

   

research and development expense increased 11 in absolute dollars when compared to the yearago period and was relatively flat as a percent of revenue the absolute dollar increase was primarily due to engineering personnel costs related to wearable and aviation product offerings and expenses resulting from recent acquisitions within the marine segment our research and development spending is focused on product development improving existing software capabilities and exploring new categories 

  

 

  

operating income 

  

   

operating income increased 14 in absolute dollars and increased 140 basis points as a percent of revenue when compared to fiscal year 2017 the growth in operating income on an absolute dollar basis and as a percent of revenue was the result of strong revenue growth and increased gross margins 

  

other income expense 

  

   

the average returns on cash and investments including interest and capital gainloss returns during the 52weeks ended december 29 2018 and december 30 2017 were 18 and 15 respectively interest income increased primarily due to higher yields on fixedincome securities 

  

foreign currency gains and losses for the company are typically driven by movements in the taiwan dollar euro and british pound sterling in relation to the us dollar the taiwan dollar is the functional currency of garmin corporation the us dollar is the functional currency of garmin europe ltd and the euro is the functional currency of most of our other european subsidiaries although some transactions and balances are denominated in british pounds the majority of the company’s consolidated foreign currency gain or loss is typically driven by the significant cash and marketable securities receivables and payables held in a currency other than the functional currency at a given legal entity due to the relative size of the entities using a functional currency other than the taiwan dollar euro and british pound sterling currency fluctuations related to these entities are not expected to have a material impact on the company’s financial statements 

  

the 76 million currency loss recognized in fiscal 2018 was primarily due to the strengthening of the us dollar against the euro and the british pound sterling offset by the us dollar strengthening against the taiwan dollar during fiscal 2018 the us dollar strengthened 47 against the euro and 60 against the british pound sterling resulting in losses of 100 million and 17 million respectively while the us dollar strengthened 30 against the taiwan dollar resulting in a gain of 151 million the remaining net currency loss of 110 million was related to timing of transactions and impacts of other currencies each of which was individually immaterial 

  

the 226 million currency loss recognized in fiscal 2017 was primarily due to the weakening of the us dollar against the taiwan dollar partially offset by the us dollar weakening against the euro and the british pound sterling during fiscal 2017 the us dollar weakened 94 against the taiwan dollar resulting in a loss of 559 million while the us dollar weakened 141 against the euro and 95 against the british pound sterling resulting in gains of 272 million and 31 million respectively the remaining net currency gain of 30 million was related to timing of transactions and impacts of other currencies each of which was individually immaterial 

  

 

 

income tax provision 

 

our income tax expense for the fiscal year ended december 29 2018 was 1292 million compared to income tax benefit of 119 million for the fiscal year ended december 30 2017 resulting in a net change of 1411 million contributing to the increase in tax expense was

 

  

partially offset by

 

   

net income 

 

as a result of the various factors noted above income before taxes increased 18 to 8232 million from 6971 million in the prior year while net income decreased 2 to 6941 million from 7090 million in the prior year

net sales 

 

 

 

net sales increased 2 in 2017 when compared to the yearago period outdoor marine and aviation segments had an increase in revenue while fitness and auto segments had a decrease in revenue auto revenue represented the largest portion of our revenue mix in 2017 at 25 which was a decline from 30 in 2016

 

total unit sales decreased 8 to 154 million units in the 52weeks ended 2017 from 168 million units in the 53weeks ended 2016

 

outdoor marine and aviation revenues increased 28 13 and 14 respectively when compared to the yearago period growth in outdoor was driven by growth in our wearables and subscriptions categories our marine segment revenue increased primarily due to growth in chartplotters fishfinders and entertainment systems and the newly acquired navionics aviation revenues increased due to growth in both oem and aftermarket sales fitness segment revenue decreased 7 from the yearago period primary driven by the general decline of the basic activity tracker market auto segment revenue decreased 14 from the yearago period primarily due to the ongoing pnd market contraction

 

 

 

cost of goods sold 

 

 

 

cost of goods sold decreased 2 in absolute dollars for the 52weeks ended december 30 2017 when compared to the 53weeks ended december 31 2016

 

in the outdoor fitness and marine segments the decrease in cost of goods sold as a percent of revenues was a result of a shift in product mix toward higher margin products the aviation segment increase in cost of goods sold was generally consistent with the segment revenue increase the auto segment cost of goods decline was largely consistent with the segment revenue decline

 

gross profit 

 

 

 

gross profit dollars in the 52weeks ended december 30 2017 increased 6 while gross profit margin increased 220 basis points compared to the 53weeks ended december 31 2016 growth in sales of higher margin segments contributed to the increase in gross profit dollars and gross margin percentage outdoor fitness and marine segment increases to gross profit margin were primarily due to product mix within those segments auto and aviation segment gross margin rates were relatively consistent between fiscal periods

 

advertising expenses 

 

 

  

advertising expense decreased 7 in absolute dollars and was relatively flat as a percent of revenues in the 52weeks ended december 30 2017 compared to the 53weeks ended december 31 2016 the decrease in absolute dollars is primarily attributable to decreases in spend on media advertising

selling general and administrative expense increased 7 in absolute dollars and was relatively flat as a percent of revenues in the 52weeks ended december 30 2017 compared to the 53weeks ended december 31 2016 the absolute dollar increase is primarily attributable to legalrelated costs and information technology costs as a percent of revenues selling general and administrative expenses in all segments except marine were relatively consistent on a year over year basis the increase in the marine segment as a percent of revenue was primarily related to a litigation settlement 

  

research and development expense 

  

 

  

research and development expense increased 9 due to ongoing development activities for new products and the addition of engineering personnel throughout the 52weeks ended december 30 2017 in absolute dollars research and development costs increased 437 million when compared with the 53weeks ended december 31 2016 and increased 100 basis points as a percent of revenue our research and development spending is focused on product development improving existing software capabilities and exploring new categories

as a result of the above operating income increased 8 in absolute dollars and 110 basis points as a percent of revenue when compared to the 53weeks ended december 31 2016 the growth in operating income both in absolute dollars and as a percent of revenue was primarily due to an increase in revenue growth and increase in gross margin percentage which were partially offset by increased operating expenses as discussed above 

  

 

  

other income expense 

  

 

  

the average returns on cash and investments including interest and capital gainloss returns during the 52weeks ended december 30 2017 and the 53 weeks ended december 31 2016 were 15 for both periods interest income increased in fiscal 2017 primarily due to slightly higher yields on fixedincome securities while other income decreased in fiscal 2017 primarily due to higher net capital gains realized in fiscal 2016 

  

foreign currency gains and losses for the company are typically driven by movements in the taiwan dollar euro and british pound sterling in relation to the us dollar the taiwan dollar is the functional currency of garmin corporation the us dollar is the functional currency of garmin europe ltd and the euro is the functional currency of most of our other european subsidiaries although some transactions and balances are denominated in british pounds the majority of the company’s consolidated foreign currency gain or loss is typically driven by the significant cash and marketable securities receivables and payables held in a currency other than the functional currency at a given legal entity due to the relative size of the entities using a functional currency other than the taiwan dollar euro and british pound sterling currency fluctuations related to these entities are not expected to have a material impact on the company’s financial statements 

  

the 226 million currency loss recognized in fiscal 2017 was primarily due to the weakening of the us dollar against the taiwan dollar partially offset by the us dollar weakening against the euro and the british pound sterling during fiscal 2017 the us dollar weakened 94 against the taiwan dollar resulting in a loss of 559 million while the us dollar weakened 141 against the euro and 95 against the british pound sterling resulting in gains of 272 million and 31 million respectively the remaining net currency gain of 30 million was related to timing of transactions and impacts of other currencies each of which was individually immaterial 

  

the 317 million currency loss recognized in fiscal 2016 was primarily due to the weakening of the us dollar against the taiwan dollar and the strengthening of the us dollar against the euro and british pound sterling during fiscal 2016 the us dollar weakened 17 against the taiwan dollar resulting in a loss of 92 million while the us dollar strengthened 42 against the euro and 168 against the british pound sterling resulting in losses of 130 million and 51 million respectively the remaining net currency loss of 44 million was related to timing of transactions and impacts of other currencies each of which was individually immaterial 

  

income tax provision 

  

our income tax benefit for the 52weeks ended december 30 2017 was 119 million compared to income tax expense of 1209 million for the 53weeks ended december 31 2016 resulting in a net change of 1328 million contributing to the decrease in tax expense was 

  

   

 

  

partially offset by 

  

    

on december 22 2017 the tax cuts and jobs act was passed by united states congress reducing the united states federal corporate income tax rate from 35 to 21 the effects of us tax reform including revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities had an immaterial impact on the 2017 income tax benefit on a provisional basis as discussed in note 6 

  

net income 

  

as a result of the various factors noted above net income increased 37 to 7090 million for the 52weeks ended december 30 2017 compared to 5177 million for the 53weeks ended december 31 2016 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

  

as of december 29 2018 we had 27148 million of cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities we primarily use cash flow from operations and expect that future cash requirements may be used to fund our capital expenditures support our working capital requirements pay dividends and fund strategic acquisitions we believe that our existing cash balances and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our longterm projected capital expenditures working capital and other cash requirements 

  

it is management’s goal to invest the onhand cash in accordance with the investment policy which has been approved by the board of directors of each applicable garmin entity holding the cash the investment policy’s primary purpose is to preserve capital maintain an acceptable degree of liquidity and maximize yield within the constraint of low credit risk garmin’s average interest income returns on cash and investments during fiscal 2018 2017 and 2016 were approximately 19 16 and 15 respectively the fair value of our securities varies from period to period due to changes in interest rates in the performance of the underlying collateral and in the credit performance of the underlying issuer among other factors see note 3 for additional information regarding marketable securities 

  

operating activities 

  

 

  

the 2587 million increase in cash provided by operating activities in fiscal year 2018 compared to fiscal year 2017 was due to the increase in cash provided by working capital of 828 million which included an increase of 464 million in net receipts of accounts receivable an increase of 579 million in accounts payable partially offset by an increase of 502 million in cash paid for inventory and income taxes payable of 486 million additionally the year over year decrease in net income of 149 million was offset by other noncash adjustments to net income of 1423 million including an income tax benefit of 1800 million related to the revaluation of certain switzerland deferred tax assets 

  

the 448 million decrease in cash provided by operating activities in fiscal year 2017 compared to fiscal year 2016 was primarily due to a decrease of cash provided by working capital of 1332 million which included increases of 522 million in accounts receivable and 315 million in cash paid for inventory and income taxes payable of 165 million the decrease was partially offset by an increase in net income of 1841 million reduced by other noncash adjustments to net income of 793 million including an income tax benefit of 1800 million related to the revaluation of certain switzerland deferred tax assets 

  

 

  

investing activities 

  

 

  

the 1131 million increase in cash used in investing activities in fiscal year 2018 compared to fiscal year 2017 was primarily due to increased net purchases of marketable securities of 1672 million and increased cash payments for net purchases of property and equipment of 148 million partially offset by a decrease in net cash paid for acquisitions of 613 million 

  

the 727 million increase in cash used in investing activities in fiscal year 2017 compared to fiscal year 2016 was primarily due to increased cash payments for net purchases of property and equipment of 491 million and net cash paid for acquisitions of 125 million 

  

financing activities 

  

 

  

the 1623 million decrease in cash used in financing activities in fiscal year 2018 compared to fiscal year 2017 was primarily due to a decrease in dividend payments of 868 million associated with the timing of dividend payments that resulted in one less dividend payment in 2018 compared to 2017 and also due to a decrease of purchases of treasury stock of 745 million under our share repurchase authorization which expired on december 31 2017 

  

the 1133 million decrease in cash used in financing activities in fiscal year 2017 compared to fiscal year 2016 was primarily due to decreased dividend payments of 985 million associated with the timing of dividend payments that resulted in an additional payment made in the 53week fiscal year 2016 and also due to a decrease of purchases of treasury stock of 187 million under our share repurchase authorization 

  

our declared dividend has increased from 051 per share for the twelve calendar quarters beginning in june 2015 to 053 per share for the four calendar quarters beginning june 2018 

  

contractual obligations and commercial commitments 

  

as of december 29 2018 operating leases comprise the substance of the company’s commercial commitments with longterm scheduled payments as summarized below 

  

 

  

the company is party to certain other commitments which include purchases of raw materials advertising expenditures and other indirect purchases in connection with conducting our business the aggregate amount of purchase orders and other commitments open as of december 29 2018 was approximately 3546 million we cannot determine the aggregate amount of such purchase orders that represent contractual obligations because purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements our purchase orders are based on our current needs and are typically fulfilled within short periods of time 

  

 

  

we may be required to make significant cash outlays related to unrecognized tax benefits however due to the uncertainty of the timing of future cash flows associated with our unrecognized tax benefits we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement if any with the respective taxing authorities accordingly unrecognized tax benefits of 1183 million as of december 29 2018 have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above for further information related to unrecognized tax benefits see note 2 “income taxes” and note 6 to the consolidated financial statements included in this report 

  

offbalance sheet arrangements 

  

we do not have any offbalance sheet arrangements 

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

market sensitivity 

  

we have market risk primarily in connection with the pricing of our products and services and the purchase of raw materials product pricing and raw materials costs are both significantly influenced by semiconductor market conditions historically during cyclical industry downturns we have been able to offset pricing declines for our products through a combination of improved product mix and success in obtaining price reductions in raw materials costs 

  

inflation 

  

we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our business financial condition or results of operations if our costs were to become subject to significant inflationary pressures we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs through price increases our inability or failure to do so could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

  

the operation of garmin’s subsidiaries in international markets results in exposure to movements in currency exchange rates we have experienced significant foreign currency gains and losses due to the strengthening and weakening of the us dollar the potential of volatile foreign exchange rate fluctuations in the future could have a significant effect on our results of operations the company has not historically hedged its foreign currency exchange rate risks 

  

the currencies that create a majority of the company’s exchange rate exposure are the taiwan dollar euro and british pound sterling garmin corporation headquartered in xizhi taiwan uses the local currency as the functional currency the company translates all assets and liabilities at yearend exchange rates and income and expense accounts at average rates during the year in order to minimize the effect of the currency exchange fluctuations on our net assets we have elected to retain most of our taiwan subsidiary’s cash and investments in accounts denominated in us dollars 

  

most european subsidiaries use the euro as the functional currency however the functional currency of our largest european subsidiary garmin europe ltd is the us dollar and as some transactions have occurred in british pounds sterling or euros foreign currency gains or losses have been realized historically related to the movements of those currencies relative to the us dollar the company believes that gains and losses will become more material in the future as our european presence grows 

  

 

  

during fiscal year 2018 the company incurred a net foreign currency loss of 76 million the strengthening of the us dollar against the euro and the british pound sterling was offset by the us dollar strengthening against the taiwan dollar during fiscal 2018 the us dollar strengthened 47 against the euro and 60 against the british pound sterling resulting in losses of 100 million and 17 million respectively while the us dollar strengthened 30 against the taiwan dollar resulting in a gain of 151 million the remaining net currency loss of 110 million was related to timing of transactions and impacts of other currencies each of which was individually immaterial these and other currency moves during fiscal year 2018 also resulted in a currency translation adjustment of 320 million within accumulated other comprehensive income 

  

we assessed the company’s exposure to movements in currency exchange rates by performing a sensitivity analysis of adverse changes in exchange rates and the corresponding impact to our results of operations based on monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than respective functional currencies as of december 29 2018 and december 30 2017 hypothetical and reasonably possible adverse changes of 10 for the taiwan dollar euro and british pound sterling would have resulted in an adverse impact on income before income taxes of approximately 109 million and 96 million at december 29 2018 and december 30 2017 respectively 

  

interest rate risk 

  

we have no outstanding longterm debt as of december 29 2018 we therefore have no meaningful debtrelated interest rate risk 

  

we are exposed to interest rate risk in connection with our investments in marketable securities as interest rates change the unrealized gains and losses associated with those securities will fluctuate accordingly 

  

the company’s investment policy targets low risk investments with the objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss the company does not intend to sell securities in an unrealized loss position and it is not more likely than not that the company will be required to sell such investments before recovery of their amortized costs bases which may be maturity during 2018 and 2017 the company did not record any material impairment charges on its outstanding securities 

  

we assessed the company’s exposure to interest rate risk by performing a sensitivity analysis of a parallel shift in the yield curve and the corresponding impact to the company’s portfolio of marketable securities based on balance sheet positions as of december 29 2018 and december 30 2017 the hypothetical and reasonably possible 100 basis point increases in interest rates across all securities would have resulted in declines in portfolio fair market value of approximately 38 million and 42 million at december 29 2018 and december 30 2017 respectively such losses would only be realized if the company sold the investments prior to maturity

overview of the global positioning system 

  

the global positioning system is a worldwide navigation system which enables the precise determination of geographic location using established satellite technology the system consists of numerous constellations of orbiting satellites access to the systems is provided free of charge

 

garmin utilizes a variety of global navigation satellite systems gnss including but not limited to

 

      

in certain urban canyon or restricted sky visibility situations the combination of gps glonass andor galileo satellites to produce a navigation fix may result in improved accuracy

 

on a subscription basis certain garmin products offer access to the iridium satellite network a synchronized constellation of 66 low earth orbit leo satellites offering global data communication coverage the iridium network is the only network that spans the entire globe offering 100 percent coverage worldwide to enable satellitebased communication

  

the accuracy and utility of gps can be enhanced through augmentation techniques which compute any remaining errors in the signal and broadcast these corrections to a gps device the federal aviation administration “faa” has developed a wide area augmentation system waas comprising ground reference stations and additional satellites that improve the accuracy of gps positioning available in the united states and most of canada and mexico to approximately 3 meters waas supports the use of gps as the primary means of enroute terminal and approach navigation for aviation in the united states the increased accuracy offered by waas also enhances the utility of waasenabled gps receivers for consumer applications

competition 

  

in general we operate in highly competitive markets though competitive conditions do vary among our diverse products and geographies garmin believes the principal competitive factors impacting the market for its products are design functionality quality and reliability customer service brand price timetomarket and availability garmin believes that it generally competes favorably in each of these areas and as such is generally a significant competitor in each of our major markets

 

garmin believes that its principal competitors for portable automotive products are tomtom nv and mitac digital corporation mitac which distributes products under the brand names of magellan mio and navman garmin believes that its principal competitors for infotainment solutions are harman international industries panasonic corporation and the mitsubishi group garmin believes that its principal competitors for outdoor product lines are vista outdoor magellan a subsidiary of mitac sportdog brand suunto oy and dogtra company garmin believes that its principal competitors for fitness products are apple inc samsung electronics co ltd bryton corp fitbit inc polar electro oy sigma sports suunto oy and wahoo fitness for marine products garmin believes that its principal competitors are furuno electronic company the humminbird division of johnson outdoors inc navico and flir systems inc for garmin’s aviation product lines garmin considers its principal competitors to be aspen avionics avidyne corporation cmc electronics dynon avionics appaero systems genesys aerosystems honeywell aerospace  defense innovative solutions and support inc l3 avionics systems rockwell collins inc thales safran sa and universal avionics systems corporation

 

research and development 

 

garmin’s product innovations are driven by its strong emphasis on research and development and the close partnership between garmin’s engineering and manufacturing teams garmin’s products are created by its engineering and development staff which numbered approximately 4000 people worldwide as of december 30 2017 garmin’s manufacturing staff includes manufacturing process engineers who work closely with garmin’s design engineers to ensure manufacturability and manufacturing cost control for its products garmin’s development staff includes industrial designers as well as software engineers electrical engineers mechanical engineers and cartographic engineers garmin believes the industrial design of its products has played an important role in garmin’s success once a development project is initiated and approved a multidisciplinary team is created to design the product and transition it into manufacturing

 

below is a table of garmin’s expenditures on research and development over the last three fiscal years

 

  

manufacturing and operations 

 

garmin believes one of its core competencies and strengths is its vertically integrated manufacturing capabilities at its taiwan facilities in xizhi jhongli and linkou its china facility in yangzhou and at its us facilities in olathe kansas and salem oregon garmin believes that its ownership and operation of its own manufacturing facilities and distribution networks provides significant capability and flexibility to address the breadth and depth of resources necessary to serve its diverse products and markets

 



 

 

specifically garmin believes that its vertical integration of its manufacturing capabilities provides advantages to product cost quality and time to market

 

cost garmin’s manufacturing resources rapidly and iteratively prototype designs concepts products and processes achieving higher efficiency resulting in lower cost garmin’s vertical integration approach enables leveraging our manufacturing resources across high mid and low volume products sharing of these resources across our product lines favorably affects garmin’s costs to produce its range of products with lower volume products realizing the economies of scale of the high volume products the ownership and integration of our resources allows garmin to optimize the design for manufacturing of our products yielding improved cost

 

quality garmin’s automation and sophisticated production processes provide inservice robustness and consistent reliability standards that enables garmin to maintain strict process and quality control of the products manufactured thereby improving the overall quality of our products additionally the immediate feedback throughout the manufacturing processes is provided to the development teams providing integrated continuous improvement throughout design and supply chain

 

time to market garmin uses multidisciplinary teams of design engineers process engineers and supply chain specialists to develop products allowing them to quickly move from concept to manufacturing this integrated ownership provides inherent flexibility to enable faster time to market

 

garmin’s design manufacturing distribution and servicing processes in its us taiwan china and uk facilities are certified to iso 9001 an international quality standard developed by the international organization for standardization garmin’s automotive operations in taiwan china uk and olathe have achieved ts 16949 certification a quality standard for automotive suppliers garmin’s olathe and salem aviation operations have achieved certification to as9100 the quality standard for the aviation industry

 

garmin international inc garmin europe ltd and garmin corporation have also achieved certification of their environmental management systems to the iso 14001 standard recognizing garmin’s systems and processes which minimize or prevent harmful effects on the environment and continually strive to improve its environmental performance

 

materials 

 

although most components essential to garmin’s business are generally available from multiple sources certain key components are currently obtained by the company from single or limited sources which subjects garmin to supply and pricing risks many of these and other key components that are available from multiple sources including but not limited to nand flash memory dynamic random access memory dram gps chipsets and certain lcds are subject at times to industrywide shortages and commodity pricing fluctuations

 

garmin and other participants in the personal computer tablet mobile communication aviation electronics and consumer electronics industries also compete for various components with other industries that have experienced increased demand for their products in addition garmin uses some custom components that are not common to the rest of the personal computer tablet mobile communication and consumer electronics industries and new products introduced by the company often utilize custom components available from only one source until garmin has evaluated whether there is a need for and subsequently qualifies additional suppliers when a component or product uses new technologies initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields have matured or manufacturing capacity has increased garmin makes efforts to manage risks in these areas through the use of supply agreements and safety stock for strategically important components nevertheless if garmin’s supply of a key singlesourced component for a new or existing product was delayed or constrained if such components were available only at significantly higher prices or if a key manufacturing vendor delayed shipments of completed products to garmin garmin’s financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected garmin’s business and financial performance could also be adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the original source or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source continued availability of these components at acceptable prices or at all may be affected if those suppliers decided to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet garmin’s requirements

  



 

  

seasonality 

  

our net sales are subject to seasonal fluctuation sales of our consumer products are generally higher in the fourth quarter due to increased demand during the holiday buying season and to a lesser extent the second quarter due to increased demand during the spring and summer season sales of consumer products are also influenced by the timing of the release of new products our aviation and auto oem products do not experience much seasonal variation but are more influenced by the timing of aircraft certifications and the release of new products when the initial demand is typically the strongest

 

backlog 

 

our sales are generally of a consumer nature and there is a relatively short cycle between order and shipment therefore we believe that backlog information is not material to the understanding of our business we typically ship most orders within 72 hours of receipt

  

intellectual property 

  

our success and ability to compete is dependent in part on our proprietary technology we rely on a combination of patent copyright trademark and trade secret laws as well as confidentiality agreements to establish and protect our proprietary rights in addition garmin often relies on licenses of intellectual property for use in its business for example garmin obtains licenses for digital cartography technology for use in our products from various sources

 

as of january 5 2018 garmin’s worldwide ip portfolio included over 1100 patent and 750 trademark registrations the duration of patents varies in accordance with the provisions of applicable local law we believe that our continued success depends on the intellectual skills of our employees and their ability to continue to innovate garmin will continue to file and prosecute patent applications when appropriate to attempt to protect garmin’s rights in its proprietary technologies 

 

there is no assurance that our current patents or patents which we may later acquire may successfully withstand any challenge in whole or in part it is also possible that any patent issued to us may not provide us with any competitive advantages or that the patents of others will preclude us from manufacturing and marketing certain products despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights to protect our trade secrets to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others or to defend against claims of infringement or invalidity

  

regulations 

  

the telecommunications industry is highly regulated and the regulatory environment in which garmin operates is subject to change in accordance with the united states’ federal communications commission fcc rules and regulations wireless transceiver products are required to be certified by the fcc and comparable authorities in foreign countries where they are sold garmin’s products sold in europe are required to comply with relevant directives of the european commission a delay in receiving required certifications for new products or enhancements to garmin’s products or losing certification for garmin’s existing products could adversely affect our business in addition aviation products that are intended for installation in “type certificated aircraft” are required to be certified by the faa its european counterpart the european aviation safety agency and other comparable organizations before they can be used in an aircraft

 



 

 

because garmin corporation one of the company’s principal subsidiaries is located in taiwan foreign exchange control laws and regulations of taiwan with respect to remittances into and out of taiwan may have an impact on garmin’s operations the taiwan foreign exchange control statute and regulations thereunder provides that all foreign exchange transactions must be executed by banks designated to handle such business by the ministry of finance of taiwan and by the central bank of the republic of china taiwan also referred to as the cbc current regulations favor traderelated foreign exchange transactions consequently foreign currency earned from exports of merchandise and services may now be retained and used freely by exporters while all foreign currency needed for the import of merchandise and services may be purchased freely from the designated foreign exchange banks aside from traderelated foreign exchange transactions taiwan companies and residents may without foreign exchange approval remit outside and into taiwan foreign currencies of up to 50 million and 5 million respectively or their equivalent each calendar year currency conversions within the limits are processed by the designated banks and do not have to be reviewed and approved by the cbc the above limits apply to remittances involving a conversion between taiwan dollars and us dollars or other foreign currencies the cbc typically approves foreign exchange in excess of the limits if a party applies with the cbc for review and presents legitimate business reasons justifying the currency conversion a requirement is also imposed on all enterprises to register all medium and longterm foreign debt with the cbc

 

environmental matters 

 

garmin’s operations are subject to various environmental laws including laws addressing air and water pollution and management of hazardous substances and wastes substantial noncompliance with applicable environmental laws could have a material adverse effect on our business capital expenditures for environmental controls are included in our normal capital budget

 

environmental regulation of garmin’s products is increasing many of garmins products are subject to laws relating to the chemical and material composition of our products and their energy efficiency garmin is also subject to laws requiring manufacturers to be financially responsible for collection recovery and recycling of wastes from certain electronic products compliance with current environmental laws does not have a material impact on our business but the impact of future enactment of environmental laws cannot yet be fully determined and could be substantial

 

garmin has implemented multiple environmental management system ems policies in accordance with the international organization for standardization iso 14001 standard for environmental health and safety management garmin’s ems policies set forth practices standards and procedures to ensure compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations at garmin’s kansas headquarters facility garmin’s european headquarters facility and garmin’s taiwan and china manufacturing facilities

 

garmin continues to strive to reduce our carbon footprint by increasing our environmental sustainability efforts our manufacturing locations have implemented increased recycling processes that keep all obsolete garmin manufactured material from entering the waste stream additionally our new facility design has been constructed with energy efficient considerations including reduced water consumption led lighting and reflective roofing to deflect solar radiation

 

employees 

  

as of december 30 2017 garmin had approximately 12300 full and parttime employees worldwide of whom approximately 4700 were in north america 5100 were in taiwan 1500 were in europe and 1000 were in other global locations except for some of garmin’s employees in brazil and sweden none of garmin’s employees are represented by a labor union and none of garmins north american or taiwan employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement garmin considers its employee relations to be positive

 



 

 




 item 1a risk factors 

  

the risks described below are not the only ones facing our company additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also impair our business operations if any of the following risks occur our business financial condition or operating results could be materially adversely affected 

  

risks related to the company 

  

if we are not successful in the continued development timely manufacture and introduction of new products or product categories demand for our products could decrease to the extent that lost sales and profits from declining segments or product categories are not entirely offset 

  

we expect that a significant portion of our future revenue will continue to be derived from sales of newly introduced products this is particularly important to replace sales and profits lost in declining segments or product categories the market for our products is characterized by rapidly changing technology evolving industry standards and changes in customer needs if we fail to introduce new products or to modify or improve our existing products in response to changes in technology industry standards or customer needs our products could rapidly become less competitive or obsolete we must continue to make significant investments in research and development in order to continue to develop new products enhance existing products and achieve market acceptance for such products however there can be no assurance that development stage products will be successfully completed or if developed will achieve significant customer acceptance

 

if we are unable to successfully develop and introduce competitive new products and enhance our existing products our future results of operations would be adversely affected our pursuit of necessary technology may require substantial time and expense we may need to license new technologies to respond to technological change these licenses may not be available to us on terms that we can accept or may materially change the gross profits that we are able to obtain on our products we may not succeed in adapting our products to new technologies as they emerge development and manufacturing schedules for technology products are difficult to predict and there can be no assurance that we will achieve timely initial customer shipments of new products the timely availability of these products in volume and their acceptance by customers are important to our future success any future challenges related to new products whether due to product development delays manufacturing delays lack of market acceptance delays in regulatory approval or otherwise could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations

  

if we are unable to compete effectively with existing or new competitors our resulting loss of competitive position could result in price reductions fewer customer orders reduced margins and loss of market share 

  

the markets for many of our products are highly competitive and we expect competition to increase in the future some of our competitors have significantly greater financial technical and marketing resources than we do these competitors may be able to respond more rapidly to new or emerging technologies or changes in customer requirements they may also be able to devote greater resources to the development promotion and sale of their products or secure better product positioning with retailers increased competition could result in price reductions fewer customer orders reduced margins and loss of market share our failure to compete successfully against current or future competitors could seriously harm our business financial condition and results of operations

  



 

  

maturation or contraction of the market for wearable devices or categories of devices could adversely affect our revenue and profits 

  

we have experienced growth in sales and profits in our outdoor and fitness segments which in recent years have benefited from increased sales of wearable devices in 2017 the fitness tracker market rapidly contracted resulting in lower sales and profits in our fitness segment if the overall wearable device market declines or categories of devices within the wearable device market decline significantly our business financial condition or operating results could be materially adversely affected

 

the demand for personal navigation devices pnds has been and continues to be reduced by replacement technologies becoming available on mobile devices and factoryinstalled systems in new autos as well as by market saturation 

  

gpsnavigation technologies have been incorporated into competing devices such as mobile handsets tablets and new automobiles through factoryinstalled systems many companies are now offering navigation software for these mobile devices the acceptance of this technology by consumers has reduced sales in the auto segment and has reduced profits in some periods navigation systems are also becoming more prevalent as standard andor optional equipment on new automobiles increased navigation penetration on mobile handsets and in new automobiles is expected to cause further declines in sales of our portable navigation devices and could further reduce profits

  

the auto segment which represents approximately 24 of our revenues is expected to continue to decline in 2018 

  

we experienced substantial growth through 2008 in the auto segment of our business as pnds became massmarket consumer electronics in both europe and north america this market is declining as competing technologies emerged and market saturation occurred this has resulted in and is expected to continue to result in lower revenues and profits for this segment

 

our annual and quarterly financial statements will reflect fluctuations in foreign currency translation 

 

the operation of our subsidiaries in international markets results in exposure to movements in currency exchange rates we have experienced significant foreign currency gains and losses due to the strengthening and weakening of the us dollar relative to certain other currencies the potential of volatile foreign exchange rate fluctuations in the future could have a significant effect on our results of operations we have not historically hedged our foreign currency exchange rate risks

 

the currencies that typically create a majority of our exchange rate exposure are the taiwan dollar euro and british pound sterling the taiwan dollar is the functional currency of garmin corporation the us dollar is the functional currency of garmin europe ltd and the euro is the functional currency of most of our other european subsidiaries although some transactions and balances are denominated in british pounds other legal entities primarily use the local currency as the functional currency due to the relative size of entities using a functional currency other than the taiwan dollar euro and british pound sterling fluctuations of other currencies are not expected to have a material impact on our financial statements

 

we translate income and expense activity at the approximate rate of exchange at the transaction date and all assets and liabilities at the rate of exchange in effect at the balance sheet date income and expense activity in a currency other than the us dollar can be impacted by exchange rate variations over time the majority of our consolidated foreign currency gain or loss is typically driven by exchange rate impacts on the significant cash receivables and payables held in a currency other than the functional currency at a given legal entity such gain or loss will create variations in our earnings per share however because there is minimal cash impact caused by such exchange rate variations management will continue to focus on our operating performance before the impact of foreign currency gains and losses

 



 

 

changes in applicable tax laws or resolutions of tax disputes could result in adverse tax consequences to the company 

 

our tax position could be adversely impacted by changes to tax laws tax treaties or tax regulations or the interpretation or enforcement thereof by any tax authority in which we file income tax returns we cannot predict the outcome of any specific legislative proposals legislative proposals are being considered in switzerland that could make significant changes in the corporate tax regime and increase the taxes applicable to us in switzerland switzerland has agreed with the european union eu to execute tax reform by 2019 in exchange for the eu’s waiver of countermeasures a failure to accomplish tax reform in the agreed timeframe may result in the eu member states reasserting countermeasure provisions which could result in additional tax for the company

 

moreover international taxing standards continue to evolve as a result of the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd recommendations aimed at preventing perceived base erosion and profit shifting by multinational corporations while these recommendations are not changes to tax law the countries where we operate may implement legislation or take unilateral actions which may result in adverse effects to our income tax provision and financial statements   

  

significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes in the ordinary course of our business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain we are regularly under audit by tax authorities although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals the results of an audit or litigation could have a material effect on our income tax provision net income or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made

 

restrictions on trade particularly on goods imported from taiwan or the people’s republic of china could significantly harm our results of operations 

  

a significant portion of our global and us sales are comprised of goods assembled and manufactured in our facilities in taiwan and the people’s republic of china the imposition of additional us or foreign governmental controls regulations that create new or enhanced restrictions on free trade with the us or increases in tariffs on goods imported into the us including goods imported from china and taiwan could have substantial adverse effects on our business operations results of operations and financial condition

 

economic regulatory and political conditions and uncertainty could adversely affect our revenue and profits 

  

our revenue and profits depend significantly on general economic conditions and the demand for products in the markets in which we compete economic weakness or constrained consumer and business spending has resulted in periods of decreased revenue and in the future could result in decreased revenue and problems with our ability to manage inventory levels and collect customer receivables in addition financial difficulties experienced by our retailers and oem customers have resulted and could result in the future in significant bad debt writeoffs and additions to reserves in our receivables and could have an adverse effect on our results of operations

 

the united kingdom uk is scheduled to formally leave the european union on march 29 2019 due to the unprecedented nature of the expected withdrawal significant uncertainty exists surrounding the terms of the expected exit we have operations in the uk and several eu member states whose currencies namely british pound sterling gbp and euro economies taxation and trade regulation among other factors could be adversely impacted by the negotiations and outcomes of the uk’s leaving the eu which is likely to be a complicated process these events could have a material adverse effect on our business operations results of operations and financial condition

 



 

 

if we do not correctly anticipate demand for our products we may not be able to secure sufficient quantities or costeffective production of our products or we could have costly excess production or inventories 

  

we have generally been able to increase or decrease production to meet fluctuations in demand however the demand for our products depends on many factors and may be difficult to forecast we expect that it will become more difficult to forecast demand as we introduce and support a diverse product portfolio as competition in the market for our products intensifies and as the markets for some of our products mature significant unanticipated fluctuations in demand could cause the following problems in our operations

 

  

  

   

we depend on third party suppliers and licensors some of which are sole source for specific components and map data used in our products our production and business would be seriously harmed if these suppliers are not able to meet our demand and alternative sources are not available or if the costs of components rise 

  

we are dependent on third party suppliers for various components used in our current products some of the components that we procure from third party suppliers include semiconductors and electroluminescent panels liquid crystal displays memory chips batteries and microprocessors the cost quality and availability of components are essential to the successful production and sale of our products some components we use are from sole source suppliers certain applicationspecific integrated circuits incorporating our proprietary designs are manufactured for us by sole source suppliers alternative sources may not be currently available for these sole source components

 

in the past we have experienced shortages of certain components in addition if there are shortages in supply of components the costs of such components may rise if suppliers are unable to meet our demand for components on a timely basis and if we are unable to obtain an alternative source or if the price of the alternative source is prohibitive our ability to maintain timely and costeffective production of our products would be seriously harmed

 

we are also dependent on third party licensors for digital mapping data used in our products there are only a limited number of suppliers of mapping data for some of our products and geographical regions the largest digital map supplier for our auto products is here formerly known as navteq which is majorityowned by a consortium of daimler ag bmw ag and audi ag although we do not foresee difficulty in continuing to license data from here at reasonable pricing due to a long term license agreement with an option to extend through 2028 if we are unable to continue licensing such mapping data from here and other primary suppliers and are unable to obtain an alternative source or if the nature of our relationships with primary suppliers changes detrimentally our ability to supply mapping data for use in our products would be seriously harmed

  



 

 

our intellectual property rights are important to our operations and we could suffer loss if they infringe upon other’s rights or are infringed upon by others 

  

we rely on a combination of patents copyrights trademarks and trade secrets confidentiality provisions and licensing arrangements to establish and protect our proprietary rights to this end we hold rights to a number of patents and registered trademarks and regularly file applications to attempt to protect our rights in new technology and trademarks however there is no guarantee that our patent applications will become issued patents or that our trademark applications will become registered trademarks in addition effective copyright patent and trade secret protection may be unavailable limited or not applied for in certain countries moreover even if approved our patents or trademarks may thereafter be successfully challenged by others or otherwise become invalidated for a variety of reasons thus any patents or trademarks we currently have or may later acquire may not provide us a significant competitive advantage

 

the value of our products relies substantially on our technical innovation in fields in which there are many patent filings third parties may claim that we or our customers some of whom are indemnified by us are infringing their intellectual property rights for example individuals and groups may purchase intellectual property assets for the purpose of asserting claims of infringement and attempting to extract settlements from us or our customers the number of these claims has increased in recent years and may continue to increase in the future such claims could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition from time to time we receive letters alleging infringement of patents trademarks or other intellectual property rights and we have been and currently are a defendant in lawsuits alleging patent infringement litigation concerning patents or other intellectual property is costly and time consuming we may seek licenses from such parties but they could refuse to grant us a license or demand commercially unreasonable terms such infringement claims could also cause us to incur substantial liabilities and to suspend or permanently cease the use of critical technologies or processes or the production or sale of major products

 

we may become subject to significant product liability costs 

  

if our aviation products malfunction or contain errors or defects airplane collisions or crashes could occur resulting in property damage personal injury or death malfunctions or errors or defects in our marine navigational products could cause boats to run aground or cause other wreckage personal injury or death if our automotive or marine products contain defects or errors in the mapping supplied by thirdparty map providers or if our users do not heed our warnings about the proper use of these products collisions or accidents could occur resulting in property damage personal injury or death if any of these events occurs we could be subject to significant liability for personal injury and property damage and under certain circumstances could be subject to a judgment for punitive damages we maintain insurance against accidentrelated risks involving our products however there can be no assurance that such insurance would be sufficient to cover the cost of damages to others or that such insurance will continue to be available at commercially reasonable rates in addition insurance coverage may not cover awards of punitive damages and may not cover the cost of associated legal fees and defense costs which could result in lower margins if we are unable to maintain sufficient insurance to cover product liability costs or if our insurance coverage does not cover the award this could have a materially adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations

  



 

  

we have claims and lawsuits against us that may result in adverse outcomes 

 

we are subject to a variety of claims and lawsuits adverse outcomes in some or all of these claims may result in significant monetary damages or injunctive relief that could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business litigation and other claims are subject to inherent uncertainties and the outcomes can be difficult to predict management may not adequately reserve for a contingent liability or we may suffer unforeseen liabilities which could then impact the results of a financial period a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements could occur for the period in which the effect of an unfavorable final outcome becomes probable and reasonably estimable which if not expected could harm our results of operations and financial condition

  

our products may contain undetected security vulnerabilities which could result in damage to our reputation lost revenue diverted development resources and increased warranty claims and litigation 

 

undiscovered vulnerabilities in our products could expose them to hackers or other unscrupulous third parties who develop and deploy viruses and other malicious software programs that could attack our products actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products could harm our reputation and lead some customers to return products to reduce or delay future purchases or use competitive products

  

we collect store process and use personal information and other customer data which subjects us to governmental regulation and other legal obligations related to privacy information security and data protection and our actual or perceived failure to comply with such obligations could harm our business 

 

we collect store process and use personal information and other user data our users’ personal information may include among other information names addresses phone numbers email addresses payment account information height weight age gender heart rates sleeping patterns gpsbased location and activity patterns due to the volume and types of the personal information and data we manage and the nature of our products and applications the security features of our platform and information systems are critical if our security measures or applications are breached disrupted or fail unauthorized persons may be able to obtain access to user data if we or our thirdparty service providers business partners or thirdparty apps with which our users choose to share their garmin data were to experience a breach disruption or failure of systems compromising our users’ data or the media suggested that our security measures or those of our thirdparty service providers were insufficient our brand and reputation could be adversely affected use of our products and services could decrease and we could be exposed to a risk of loss litigation and regulatory proceedings depending on the nature of the information compromised in the event of a data breach disruption or other unauthorized access to our user data we may also have obligations to notify users about the incident and we may need to provide some form of remedy for the individuals affected by the incident a growing number of legislative and regulatory bodies have adopted consumer notification requirements in the event of unauthorized access to or acquisition of certain types of personal data such breach notification laws continue to evolve and may be inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another complying with these obligations could cause us to incur substantial costs and could increase negative publicity surrounding any incident that compromises user data our users may also accidentally disclose or lose control of their passwords creating the perception that our systems or those of our thirdparty service providers are not secure against thirdparty access additionally if third parties we work with such as vendors business partners service providers or developers violate applicable laws agreements or our policies such violations may also put our users’ information at risk and could in turn have an adverse effect on our business while we maintain insurance coverage that subject to policy terms and conditions and a significant selfinsured retention is designed to address certain aspects of cyber risks such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise in the continually evolving area of cyber risk

 

regulatory authorities around the world are considering a number of legislative and regulatory proposals concerning data protection and a new data protection regulation in the eu with significant fines and penalties for noncompliance will go into effect in may 2018 in addition the interpretation and application of consumer and data protection laws in the us europe and elsewhere are sometimes uncertain and in flux it is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our interpretation and data practices if so in addition to the possibility of fines this could result in an order requiring that we change our data practices which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations complying with these various laws could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business

  



 

  

we rely on information technology systems for our business operations failures or disruptions including security breaches or cyber attacks to our information technology systems may harm our reputation and adversely affect our business and result of operations 

 

our information technology systems allow for our daily business operations to operate efficiently and effectively these systems assist in our business processes including but not limited to communications financial management supply chain management order processing shipping and billing and providing services and support to our customers additionally we electronically maintain sensitive data including intellectual property our proprietary business information and that of our customers and suppliers and some personally identifiable information of our customers and employees in our facilities and on our networks the secure processing maintenance and transmission of this information is important to our operations a disruption to any of these processes can adversely affect our business and results of operations furthermore a breach of our security systems and procedures or those of our vendors could result in significant data losses or theft of our intellectual property as well as our customers or our employees intellectual property proprietary business information or personally identifiable information a cybersecurity breach could negatively affect our competitive position and operating results as a result of theft of our intellectual property and could negatively affect our reputation as a trusted product and service provider by adversely affecting the markets perception of the security or reliability of our products or services 

 

we have technology and processes in place to detect and respond to data security incidents however because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access disable or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently and may be difficult to detect for long periods of time we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventive measures in addition hardware software or applications we develop or procure from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture or other problems that could unexpectedly compromise information security unauthorized parties may also attempt to gain access to our systems or facilities through fraud trickery or other forms of deceiving our customers and employees accordingly we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate security barriers or other preventative measures or if such measures are implemented and even with appropriate training conducted in support of such measures human errors may still occur it is virtually impossible for us to entirely mitigate this risk a party whether internal or external who is able to circumvent our security measures could misappropriate information

 

actual or anticipated attacks and risks may cause us to incur increasing costs including costs to deploy additional personnel and protection technologies to conduct additional employee training and to engage third party security experts and consultants our technology errors and omissions insurance may not protect against all of the costs liabilities and other adverse effects arising from a security breach or system failure if we fail to reasonably maintain the security of confidential information we may suffer significant reputational and financial losses and our results of operations cash flows financial condition and liquidity may be adversely affected in addition a system breach could result in other negative consequences including disruption of internal operations and may subject us to private litigation government investigations enforcement actions and cause us to incur potentially significant liability damages or remediation costs

 

gross margins for our products may fluctuate or erode 

  

gross margins in some of our segments are volatile and could decline in the future due to competitive price reductions that are not fully offset by material cost reductions in addition our overall gross margin may fluctuate from period to period due to a number of factors including product mix competition and unit volumes in particular the average selling prices of a specific product tend to decrease over that product’s life to offset such decreases we intend to rely primarily on component cost reduction obtaining yield improvements and corresponding cost reductions in the manufacturing of existing products and on introducing new products that incorporate advanced features and therefore can be sold at higher average selling prices however there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain any such yield improvements or cost reductions or introduce any such new products in the future to the extent that such cost reductions and new product introductions do not occur in a timely manner or our products do not achieve market acceptance our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected

 

we may experience unique economic and political risks associated with companies that operate in taiwan 

  

our principal manufacturing facilities where we manufacture most of our consumer products are located in taiwan relations between taiwan and the people’s republic of china also referred to as the prc and other factors affecting the political or economic conditions of taiwan in the future could materially affect our business financial condition and results of operations and the market price and the liquidity of our shares

 



 

 

the prc asserts sovereignty over all of china including taiwan certain other islands and all of mainland china the prc government does not recognize the legitimacy of the taiwan government although significant economic and cultural relations have been established during recent years between taiwan and the prc the prc government has indicated that it may use military force to gain control over taiwan in certain circumstances such as the declaration of independence by taiwan the united states relations with taiwan are governed by the 1979 taiwan relations act which signifies when the us switched diplomatic recognition from taiwan to the prc referred to as the onechina policy deviations from the onechina policy could lead to adverse changes in chinaus and chinataiwan relations and could adversely affect our operations in taiwan in the future

 

changes in our united states federal income tax classification or that of our subsidiaries could result in adverse tax consequences to our 10 or greater us shareholders 

  

the tax cuts and jobs act the “2017 act” signed on december 22 2017 may have changed the consequences to us shareholders that own or are considered to own as a result of the attribution rules ten percent or more of the voting power or value of the stock of a nonus corporation a 10 us shareholder under the us federal income tax law applicable to owners of us controlled foreign corporations “cfcs” 

 

prior to the 2017 act the company did not believe we or any of our nonus subsidiaries were considered a cfc which is a determination made daily based on whether the 10 us shareholders together own or are considered to own as a result of the attribution rules more than fifty percent of the voting power or value of a nonus corporation the 2017 act repealed internal revenue code section 958b4 which unless clarified in future regulations or other guidance may result in classification of certain of the company’s foreign subsidiaries as cfcs with respect to any single 10 us shareholder this may be the result without regard to whether 10 us shareholders together own directly or indirectly more than fifty percent of the voting power or value of the company as was the case under prior rules the repeal is effective as of the last taxable year of cfcs beginning before january 1 2018 and for the taxable year of 10 us shareholders in which the cfcs taxable year ends 

 

additional tax consequences to 10 us shareholders of a cfc may result from other provisions of the 2017 act for example the 2017 act amended section 965 to require 10 us shareholders to include in income their prorata share of certain earnings and profits ep of cfcs this section 965 inclusion is accompanied by a partial dividendsreceived deduction the 2017 act also added section 951a which requires a 10 us shareholder of a cfc to include in income its prorata share of the global intangible lowtaxed income gilti of the cfc finally the 2017 act eliminated the requirement in section 951a necessitating that a foreign corporation be considered a cfc for an uninterrupted period of at least 30 days in order for a 10 us shareholder to have a current income inclusion

 

from time to time the company may elect to employ antidilutive measures such as a stock buyback program these measures could inadvertently create additional 10 us shareholders and thus trigger adverse tax consequences for those shareholders as described above we urge shareholders to consult their individual tax advisers for advice regarding the 2017 act revisions to the us federal income tax law applicable to owners of cfcs given the current uncertainty regarding their scope of applicability

 

failure to obtain required certifications of our products on a timely basis could harm our business 

  

we have certain products especially in our aviation segment that are subject to governmental and similar certifications before they can be sold for example faa certification is required for all of our aviation products that are intended for installation in typecertificated aircraft to the extent required certification is an expensive and timeconsuming process that requires significant focus and resources an inability to obtain or excessive delay in obtaining such certifications could have an adverse effect on our ability to introduce new products and for certain aviation oem products our customers’ ability to sell airplanes delays in our obtaining certification for our aviation products have resulted and may in the future result in our being required to pay compensation to our customers therefore such inabilities or delays could adversely affect our operating results in addition we cannot assure that our certified products will not be decertified any such decertification could have an adverse effect on our operating results

 



 

 

our business may suffer if we are not able to hire and retain sufficient qualified personnel or if we lose our key personnel 

  

our future success depends partly on the continued contribution of our key executive engineering sales marketing manufacturing and administrative personnel we currently do not have employment agreements with any of our key executive officers swiss law prohibits us from paying severance payments to our senior executive officers which may impair our ability to recruit for these positions we do not have key person life insurance on any of our key executive officers and do not currently intend to obtain such insurance the loss of the services of any of our senior level management or other key employees could harm our business recruiting and retaining the skilled personnel we require to maintain and grow our market position may be difficult for example in some recent years there has been a nationwide shortage of qualified engineers in the united states who are necessary for us to design and develop new products and therefore it has sometimes been challenging to recruit such personnel if we fail to hire and retain qualified employees we may not be able to maintain and expand our business

 

our quarterly operating results are subject to fluctuations and seasonality 

  

our operating results are difficult to predict our future quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly if such operating results decline the price of our stock could decline as we have expanded our operations our operating expenses particularly our research and development costs have increased as a percentage of our sales in some periods if revenues decrease and we continue to increase research and development costs our operating results would be negatively affected

 

historically our revenues have been weaker in the first quarter of each fiscal year as many of our devices are highly consumeroriented and consumer buying is traditionally lower in this quarter sales of certain of our fitness outdoor marine and automotive products tend to be higher in our second fiscal quarter due to increased consumer spending for such products in the spring season and travel season sales of many of our consumer products also have been higher in our fourth fiscal quarter due to increased consumer spending patterns on electronic devices during the holiday season in addition we attempt to time our new product releases to coincide with relatively higher consumer spending in the second and fourth fiscal quarters which contributes to these seasonal variations

  

we rely on independent dealers and distributors to sell our products and disruption to these channels would harm our business 

  

because we sell many of our products to independent dealers and distributors we are subject to many risks including risks related to their inventory levels and support for our products in particular our dealers and distributors maintain significant levels of our products in their inventories if dealers and distributors attempt to reduce their levels of inventory or if they do not maintain sufficient levels to meet customer demand our sales could be negatively impacted

 

many of our dealers and distributors also sell products offered by our competitors if our competitors offer our dealers and distributors more favorable terms those dealers and distributors may deemphasize or decline to carry our products in the future we may not be able to retain or attract a sufficient number of qualified dealers and distributors if we are unable to maintain successful relationships with dealers and distributors or to expand our distribution channels our business will suffer

  



 

  

we may pursue strategic acquisitions investments strategic partnerships or other ventures and our business could be materially harmed if we fail to successfully identify complete and integrate such transactions 

  

we intend to evaluate acquisition opportunities and opportunities to make investments in complementary businesses technologies services or products or to enter into strategic partnerships with parties who can provide access to those assets additional product or services offerings additional distribution or marketing synergies or additional industry expertise we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition investment or strategic partnership candidates or if we do identify suitable candidates in the future we may not be able to complete those transactions on commercially favorable terms or at all

 

any past or future acquisition could also result in difficulties assimilating acquired employees operations and products and diversion of capital and management’s attention away from other business issues and opportunities integration of acquired companies may result in problems related to integration of technology and inexperienced management teams in addition the key personnel of the acquired company may decide not to work for us we may not successfully integrate internal controls compliance under the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 and other corporate governance matters operations personnel or products related to acquisitions we may make in the future if we fail to successfully integrate such transactions our business could be materially harmed

 

there is uncertainty as to our shareholders’ ability to enforce certain foreign civil liabilities in switzerland and taiwan 

  

we are a swiss company and a substantial portion of our assets are located outside the united states particularly in taiwan as a result it may be difficult to effect service of process within the united states upon us in addition there is uncertainty as to whether the courts of switzerland or taiwan would recognize or enforce judgments of united states courts obtained against us predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the united states or any state thereof or be competent to hear original actions brought in switzerland or taiwan against us predicated upon the securities laws of the united states or any state thereof

 

a shut down of federal aviation administration operations would harm our business 

  

any failure of the united states congress to appropriate funds for faa operations that results in any shut down of faa operations or furloughing of faa employees could result in delays in the required faa certification of our avionics products and in the production sale and registration of aircraft that use our avionics products such delays could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results

 

many of our products rely on the global positioning system and other global satellite navigation systems gnss 

  

the global positioning system gps is a satellitebased navigation and positioning system consisting of a constellation of orbiting satellites the satellites and their ground control and monitoring stations are maintained and operated by the united states department of defense the department of defense does not currently charge users for access to the satellite signals these satellites and their ground support systems are complex electronic systems subject to electronic and mechanical failures and possible sabotage the satellites were originally designed to have lives of 75 years and are subject to damage by the hostile space environment in which they operate however of the current deployment of satellites in place some have been operating for more than 20 years

 

to repair damaged or malfunctioning satellites is currently not economically feasible if a significant number of satellites were to become inoperable there could be a substantial delay before they are replaced with new satellites a reduction in the number of operating satellites may impair the current utility of the gps system and the growth of current and additional market opportunities gps satellites and ground control segments are being modernized gps modernization software updates can cause problems we depend on public access to open technical specifications in advance of gps updates

 



 

 

gps is operated by the us government which is committed to maintenance and improvement of gps however if the policy were to change and gps were no longer supported by the us government or if user fees were imposed it could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition

 

some of our products also use signals from satellite based augmentation systems sbas that augment gps such as the us wide area augmentation system waas japanese mtsatbased satellite augmentation system msas and european geostationary navigation overlay service egnos any curtailment of sbas operating capability could result in decreased user capability for many of our aviation products thereby impacting our markets

 

some of our products also use satellite signals from the russian glonass system other countries including china and india are in the process of creating their own gnss systems and we either have developed or will develop products which use gnss signals from these systems the european community is developing an independent radio navigation satellite system known as galileo national or european authorities may provide preferential access to signals to companies associated with their markets including our competitors which could harm our competitive position use of nonus gnss signals may also be subject to fcc waiver requirements and to restrictions based upon international trade or geopolitical considerations if we are unable to develop timely and competitive commercial products using these systems or obtain timely and equal access to service signals it could result in lost revenue

 

any of the foregoing factors could affect the willingness of buyers of our products to select global positioning systembased products instead of products based on competing technologies

 

our business is subject to disruptions and uncertainties caused by geopolitical instability war or terrorism 

 

acts of war or acts of terrorism especially any directed at the gps signals could have a material adverse impact on our business operating results and financial condition the threat of terrorism and war and heightened security and military response to this threat or any future acts of terrorism may cause a redeployment of the satellites used in gps or interruptions of the system to the extent that such interruptions have an effect on sales of our products this could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition

  

a shut down of airspace or imposition of restrictions on general aviation would harm our business the shutdown of airspace could cause reduced sales of our general aviation products and delays in the shipment of our products manufactured in our taiwan manufacturing facilities to our global distribution facilities thereby adversely affecting our ability to supply new and existing products to our dealers and distributors

 

any reallocation or repurposing of radio frequency spectrum could cause harmful interference with the reception of global positioning system signals this interference could harm our business 

  

our global positioning system technology is dependent on the use of the standard positioning service sps provided by the us government’s global positioning system satellites the global positioning system operates in radio frequency bands that are globally allocated for radio navigation satellite services international allocations of radio frequency are made by the international telecommunications union itu a specialized technical agency of the united nations these allocations are further governed by radio regulations that have treaty status and which may be subject to modification every two to three years by the world radio communication conference each country also has regulatory authority on how each band is used in the united states the federal communications commission fcc and the national telecommunications and information administration ntia share responsibility for radio frequency allocations and spectrum usage regulations

 

any itu or national reallocation of radio frequency spectrum including frequency band segmentation or sharing of spectrum or other modifications of the permitted uses of relevant frequency bands may materially and adversely affect the utility and reliability of our products and have significant negative impacts on our business and our customers

  



 

  

natural disasters catastrophic events or climate change could affect our financial results 

  

natural disasters and extreme weather events such as tsunamis or earthquakes could occur in a region where we have a manufacturing or warehousing facility which would cause disruptions in our business operations or loss of inventory if our backup and recovery plans are not sufficient to minimize business disruption andor if our insurance is not sufficient to recover the costs associated with these types of events our financial results could be adversely affected 

 

climate change can also pose a risk to our business due to evolving regulatory and legislative measures surrounding climate change the environmental protection agency has begun to regulate greenhouse gas emissions under the authority granted to it under the clean air act at the federal legislative level congressional passage of legislation adopting some form of federal mandatory greenhouse gas emission reduction such as a nationwide capandtrade program does not appear likely at this time although it could be adopted at a future date it is also possible that the us congress may pass alternative climate change bills that do not mandate a nationwide capandtrade program and instead focus on promoting renewable energy and energy efficiency which could increase the cost of doing business

 

because it is uncertain what laws and regulations will be enacted we cannot predict the potential impact of such laws and regulations on our future consolidated financial condition results of operations or cash flows

  

risks relating to our shares 

  

the volatility of our stock price could adversely affect investment in our common shares 

 

the market price of our shares has been and may continue to be highly volatile during 2017 the closing price of our shares ranged from a low of 4735 to a high of 6292 a variety of factors could cause the price of our shares to fluctuate perhaps substantially including

 

              



 

 

in addition in recent years the stock market in general and the markets for shares of technology companies in particular have experienced extreme price fluctuations which have often been unrelated to the operating performance of affected companies any such fluctuations in the future could adversely affect the market price of our common shares

  

our officers and directors exert substantial influence over us 

  

as of january 17 2018 members of our board of directors and our executive officers and gary burrell our cofounder and former executive officer and member of our board of directors together with members of their families and entities that may be deemed affiliates of or related to such persons or entities beneficially owned approximately 3999 of our outstanding shares accordingly these shareholders may be able to determine the outcome of corporate actions requiring shareholder approval such as mergers and acquisitions and shareholder proposals this level of ownership may have a significant effect in delaying deferring or preventing a change in control of garmin and may adversely affect the voting and other rights of other holders of our common shares

  

the rights of our shareholders are governed by swiss law 

 

the rights of our shareholders are governed by swiss law and garmin ltd’s articles of association the rights of shareholders under swiss law differ from the rights of shareholders of companies incorporated in other jurisdictions for example swiss law allows our shareholders acting at a shareholders’ meeting to authorize share capital that can be issued by the board of directors without approval of a shareholders’ meeting but this authorization is limited to 50 of the existing registered share capital and must be renewed at a shareholders’ meeting at least every two years for it to continue to be available additionally subject to specified exceptions including the exceptions described in our articles of association swiss law grants preemptive rights to existing shareholders to subscribe for new issuances of shares and other securities swiss law also does not provide as much flexibility in the various terms that can attach to different classes of shares as the laws of some other jurisdictions swiss law also reserves for approval by shareholders certain corporate actions over which a board of directors would have authority in some other jurisdictions for example swiss law provides that dividends and other distributions must be approved by shareholders at the general meeting of shareholders these swiss law requirements relating to our capital management may limit our flexibility and situations may arise where greater flexibility would have provided substantial benefits to our shareholders

 

we have limited capital reserves from which to make distributions or repurchase shares without subjecting our shareholders swiss withholding tax 

 

if we are unable to make distributions if any through a reduction of par value or to pay dividends if any out of qualifying capital contribution reserves then any dividends paid by us will generally be subject to a swiss federal withholding tax at a rate of 35 over the long term the amount of par value and qualifying capital contribution reserves available for us to use for par value reductions or dividends will be limited the withholding tax must be withheld from the gross distribution and paid to the swiss federal tax administration a us holder that qualifies for benefits under the convention between the united states of america and the swiss confederation for the avoidance of double taxation with respect to taxes on income may apply for a refund of the tax withheld in excess of the 15 treaty rate or in excess of the 5 reduced treaty rate for qualifying corporate shareholders with at least 10 participation in our voting stock or for a full refund in case of qualified pension funds however there can be no assurance that our shareholders will approve a reduction in par value or a dividend out of qualifying capital contribution reserves that we will be able to meet the other legal requirements for a reduction in par value or that swiss withholding rules will not be changed in the future or that a change in swiss law will not adversely affect us or our shareholders in particular as a result of distributions out of qualifying capital contribution reserves becoming subject to additional corporate law or other restrictions if we are unable to make a distribution through a reduction in par value or to pay a dividend out of qualifying capital contribution reserves we may not be able to make distributions without subjecting our shareholders to swiss withholding taxes

 



 

 

under current swiss tax law repurchases of shares for the purposes of capital reduction are treated as a partial liquidation subject to 35 swiss withholding tax on the difference between the par value and the repurchase price however the portion of the repurchase price that is attributed to qualifying capital contribution reserves of the shares repurchased will not be subject to the swiss withholding tax therefore repurchase of our own shares further limits the amount of qualifying capital reserves available for distributions to shareholders free of swiss withholding taxes no partial liquidation treatment applies and no withholding tax is triggered if the shares are not repurchased for cancellation but held by us as treasury shares to the extent sufficient qualifying capital reserves are available however should we not resell such treasury shares within six years and there is not sufficient qualifying capital contribution reserves the withholding tax becomes due at the end of the sixyear period 

 

we may follow a share repurchase process for future share repurchases if any similar to a second trading line on the six swiss exchange in which swiss institutional investors buy shares on the open market and sell these shares to us and are generally able to receive a refund of the swiss withholding tax however if we are unable to use this process successfully we may not be able to repurchase shares for the purposes of capital reduction without subjecting our shareholders to swiss withholding taxes if and to the extent that the repurchase of shares is made out of retained earnings or other taxable reserves no withholding tax would be applicable if and to the extent that qualifying capital contribution reserves are attributable to the share repurchase

 

we have certain limitations on our ability to repurchase and hold our own shares 

  

under swiss law we have certain limitations on our ability to repurchase and hold our own shares we and our subsidiaries may only repurchase and hold our own shares to the extent that sufficient freely distributable reserves including contributed surplus as determined for swiss tax and statutory purposes are available the aggregate par value of our registered shares held by us and our subsidiaries may not exceed 10 of our registered share capital we may repurchase our registered shares beyond the statutory limit of 10 however if our shareholders have adopted a resolution at a general meeting of shareholders authorizing the board of directors to repurchase registered shares in an amount in excess of 10 and the repurchased shares are dedicated for cancellation our ability to repurchase and hold our own shares has been a component of our capital management and shareholder return practices and any restriction on our ability to repurchase our shares could make our stock less attractive to investors

unless otherwise indicated dollar amounts set forth in the tables are in thousands except per share data

 

overview 

 

we are a leading worldwide provider of navigation communications and information devices most of which are enabled by global positioning system or gps technology we operate in five business segments which serve the marine outdoor fitness auto and aviation markets our segments offer products through our network of subsidiary distributors and independent dealers and distributors however the nature of products and types of customers for the five segments can vary significantly as such the segments are managed separately

 

since our first products were delivered in 1991 we have generated positive income from operations each year and have funded our growth from these profits

 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

  

general 

 

garmin’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon garmin’s consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the presentation of these financial statements requires garmin to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis garmin evaluates its estimates including those related to customer sales programs and incentives product returns bad debts inventories investments intangible assets income taxes warranty obligations and contingencies and litigation garmin bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions

 



 

 

for information on each of the following critical accounting policies andor estimates refer to the discussion in the notes to the consolidated financial statements as indicated in the table below

 

  

accounting terms and characteristics 

  

net sales 

 

our net sales are primarily generated through sales to our retail partners dealer and distributor network and to original equipment manufacturers refer to the revenue recognition discussion in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements our sales are largely of a consumer nature therefore backlog levels are not necessarily indicative of our future sales results we aim to achieve a quick turnaround on orders we receive and we typically ship most orders within 72 hours

 

net sales are subject to seasonal fluctuation typically sales of our consumer products are highest in the fourth quarter due to increased demand during the holiday buying season and in the second quarter due to increased demand during the spring and summer season our aviation and auto oem products do not experience much seasonal variation but are more influenced by the timing of aircraft certifications and the release of new products when the initial demand is typically the strongest

 

cost of salesgross profit 

 

raw material costs are our most significant component of cost of goods sold our existing practice of performing the design and manufacture of our products inhouse has enabled us to source components from different suppliers and where possible to redesign our products to leverage lower cost components we believe that our flexible production model allows our xizhi jhongli and linkou manufacturing plants in taiwan yangzhou manufacturing plant in china and our olathe kansas and salem oregon manufacturing plants in the us to experience relatively low costs of manufacturing in general products manufactured in taiwan have been our highest volume products our manufacturing labor costs historically have been lower in taiwan and china than in olathe and salem

 

sales price variability has had and can be expected to have an effect on our gross profit in the past prices of our devices sold into the auto market have declined due to market pressures and introduction of new products sold at lower price points in recent years pricing has stabilized in auto allowing for relatively stable gross margins excluding the impact of deferred revenues and costs the average selling prices of our aviation outdoor fitness and marine products have historically been stable due to product mix and the introduction of more advanced products sold at higher prices the effect of the sales price differences inherent within the mix of products sold could have a significant impact on our gross profit

  



 

  

advertising expense 

  

our advertising expenses consist of costs for media advertising cooperative advertising with our retail partners point of sale displays and sponsorships

 

selling general and administrative expenses 

 

our selling general and administrative expenses consist primarily of

 

        

research and development 

 

the majority of our research and development costs represent salaries for our engineers and costs of test equipment and components used in product and prototype development

 

we are committed to increasing the level of innovative design and development of new products as we strive for expanded ability to serve our existing consumer and aviation markets as well as new markets for active lifestyle products

 

income taxes 

 

we have experienced a relatively low effective corporate tax rate due to the proportion of our revenue generated by entities in tax jurisdictions with low statutory rates in particular the profit entitlement afforded our swissbased companies based on their intellectual property rights ownership of our consumer products have contributed to our relatively low effective corporate tax rate

  



 

  

results of operations 

  

the following table sets forth our results of operations as a percentage of net sales during the periods shown the table may not foot due to rounding

 

  

in 2016 the company moved action camera related revenue and expenses from the outdoor segment to the auto segment allowing for alignment and synergies with other camerabased efforts occurring within the auto segment the overall impact of the move was immaterial however action camera related operating results for the 52weeks ended december 26 2015 has been recast to conform to the 2017 and 2016 presentation

 

the following table sets forth our results of operations through operating income for each of our five segments during the period shown for each line item in the table the total of the segments’ amounts equals the amount in the consolidated statements of income data included in item 6

 



 

 

  

  

   

comparison of 52weeks ended december 30 2017 and 53weeks ended december 31 2016 

 

net sales 

  

  

net sales increased 2 in 2017 when compared to the yearago period outdoor marine and aviation segments had an increase in revenue while fitness and auto segments had a decrease in revenue fitness revenue represented the largest portion of our revenue mix at 25 in 2017 which was a slight decline from 27 in 2016 auto revenue represented the largest portion of our revenue mix in 2016 at 29 and declined to 24 in 2017

 

total unit sales decreased 8 to 154 million units in the 52weeks ended 2017 from 168 million units in the 53weeks ended 2016

 



 

 

auto segment revenue decreased 15 from the yearago period primarily due to the ongoing pnd market contraction fitness segment revenue decreased 7 from the yearago period primary driven by the general decline of the basic activity tracker market outdoor marine and aviation revenues increased 28 13 and 14 respectively when compared to the yearago period growth in outdoor was driven by growth in our wearables and subscriptions categories our marine segment revenue increased primarily due to growth in chartplotters fishfinders and entertainment systems and the newly acquired navionics aviation revenues increased due to growth in both oem and aftermarket sales

 

cost of goods sold 

  

   

cost of goods sold decreased 3 in absolute dollars for the 52weeks ended december 30 2017 when compared to the 53weeks ended december 31 2016

 

the auto segment cost of goods decline was largely consistent with the segment revenue decline in the outdoor fitness and marine segments the decrease in cost of goods sold as a percent of revenues was a result of a shift in product mix toward higher margin products the aviation segment increase in cost of goods sold was generally consistent with the segment revenue increase

  

gross profit 

 

  

gross profit dollars in the 52weeks ended december 30 2017 increased 6 while gross profit margin increased 210 basis points compared to the 53weeks ended december 31 2016 growth in sales of higher margin segments contributed to the increase in gross profit dollars and gross margin percentage outdoor fitness and marine segment increases to gross profit margin were primarily due to product mix within those segments auto and aviation segment gross margin rates were relatively consistent between fiscal periods

  



 

  

advertising expenses 

 

  

advertising expense decreased 7 in absolute dollars and was relatively flat as a percent of revenues in the 52weeks ended december 30 2017 compared to the 53weeks ended december 31 2016 the decrease in absolute dollars is primarily attributable to decreases in spend on media advertising

  

selling general and administrative expenses 

 

  

selling general and administrative expense increased 7 in absolute dollars and was relatively flat as a percent of revenues in the 52weeks ended december 30 2017 compared to the 53weeks ended december 31 2016 the absolute dollar increase is primarily attributable to legalrelated costs and information technology costs as a percent of revenues selling general and administrative expenses in all segments except marine were relatively consistent on a year over year basis the increase in the marine segment as a percent of revenues was primarily related to a litigation settlement

  

research and development expense 

 

  

research and development expense increased 9 due to ongoing development activities for new products and the addition of engineering personnel throughout the 52weeks ended december 30 2017 in absolute dollars research and development costs increased 437 million when compared with the 53weeks ended december 31 2016 and increased 100 basis points as a percent of revenue our research and development spending is focused on product development improving existing software capabilities and exploring new categories

 



 

 

operating income 

 

   

as a result of the above operating income increased 7 in absolute dollars and 100 basis points as a percent of revenue when compared to the 53weeks ended december 31 2016 the growth in operating income both in absolute dollars and as a percent of revenue was primarily due to an increase in revenue growth and increase in gross margin percentage which was partially offset by increased operating expenses as discussed above

  

other income expense 

 

  

the average returns on cash and investments including interest and capital gainloss returns during the 52weeks ended december 30 2017 and the 53 weeks ended december 31 2016 were 15 for both periods interest income increased in fiscal 2017 primarily due to slightly higher yields on fixedincome securities while other income decreased in fiscal 2017 primarily due to higher net capital gains realized in fiscal 2016

 

foreign currency gains and losses for the company are typically driven by movements in the taiwan dollar euro and british pound sterling in relation to the us dollar the taiwan dollar is the functional currency of garmin corporation the us dollar is the functional currency of garmin europe ltd and the euro is the functional currency of most of our other european subsidiaries although some transactions and balances are denominated in british pounds the majority of the company’s consolidated foreign currency gain or loss is typically driven by the significant cash and marketable securities receivables and payables held in a currency other than the functional currency at a given legal entity due to the relative size of the entities using a functional currency other than the taiwan dollar euro and british pound sterling currency fluctuations related to these entities are not expected to have a material impact on the company’s financial statements

 

the 226 million currency loss recognized in fiscal 2017 was primarily due to the weakening of the us dollar against the taiwan dollar partially offset by the us dollar weakening against the euro and the british pound sterling during fiscal 2017 the us dollar weakened 94 against the taiwan dollar resulting in a loss of 559 million while the us dollar weakened 141 against the euro and 95 against the british pound sterling resulting in gains of 272 million and 31 million respectively the remaining net currency gain of 30 million is related to other currencies and timing of transactions

cost of goods sold 

  

  

cost of goods sold increased 4 in absolute dollars for the 53weeks ended december 31 2016 when compared to the 52weeks ended december 26 2015

 

in the auto segment the cost of goods decline was largely consistent with the segment revenue decline in the outdoor and fitness segments the increases of 32 and 29 in cost of goods sold respectively primarily reflect strong volume growth in the marine and aviation segments the increases of 16 and 6 respectively primarily reflect volume growth

research and development expense 

 

  

research and development expense increased 10 due to ongoing development activities for new products and additional engineering personnel throughout the 53weeks ended december 31 2016 in absolute dollars research and development costs increased 409 million when compared with the 52weeks ended december 26 2015 and increased 40 basis points as a percent of revenue our research and development spending is focused on product development improving existing software capabilities and exploring new categories

partially offset by

 

   

net income 

 

as a result of the various factors noted above net income increased 12 to 5108 million for the 53weeks ended december 31 2016 compared to 4562 million for the 52weeks ended december 26 2015

  

liquidity and capital resources 

 

as of december 30 2017 we had 23132 million of cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities we primarily use cash flow from operations and expect that future cash requirements will be used to fund our capital expenditures support our working capital requirements pay dividends fund share repurchases and fund strategic acquisitions we believe that our existing cash balances and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our longterm projected capital expenditures working capital and other cash requirements

 

it is management’s goal to invest the onhand cash in accordance with the investment policy which has been approved by the board of directors of each applicable garmin entity holding the cash the investment policy’s primary purpose is to preserve capital maintain an acceptable degree of liquidity and maximize yield within the constraint of low credit risk garmin’s average interest rate returns on cash and investments during fiscal 2017 2016 and 2015 were approximately 16 15 and 12 respectively the fair value of our securities varies from period to period due to changes in interest rates in the performance of the underlying collateral and in the credit performance of the underlying issuer among other factors see note 3 for additional information regarding marketable securities

  

operating activities 

 

  

the 448 million decrease in cash provided by operating activities in fiscal year 2017 compared to fiscal year 2016 was primarily due to a decrease of cash provided by working capital of 1332 million which included increases of 522 million in accounts receivable and 315 million in cash paid for inventory and income taxes payable of 165 million the decrease was partially offset by an increase in net income of 1841 million reduced by other noncash adjustments to net income of 793 million

 

the 4252 million increase in cash provided by operating activities in fiscal year 2016 compared to fiscal year 2015 was primarily due to an increase in cash provided by working capital of 2235 million which included decreases of 1225 million in cash paid for inventory and 1096 million in cash paid for prepaid royalties and other assets and income taxes payable of 1540 million primarily attributable to cash taxes paid related to a 2015 intercompany restructuring the increase was also impacted by an increase of net income of 546 million reduced by other noncash adjustments to net income of 69 million

 

investing activities 

  

  



 

 

the 730 million increase in cash used in investing activities in fiscal year 2017 compared to fiscal year 2016 was primarily due to increased cash payments for net purchases of property and equipment of 491 million and net cash paid for acquisitions of 125 million

 

the 96 million increase in cash used in investing activities in fiscal year 2016 compared to fiscal year 2015 was primarily due to increased net cash paid for acquisitions of 393 million and net purchases of property and equipment of 176 million partially offset by an increase of 490 million in net redemptions of marketable securities

 

we have budgeted approximately 140 million to 150 million of capital expenditures during fiscal 2018 to include some facility expansion along with normal ongoing capital expenditures and maintenance activities approximately half of the budgeted capital expenditures in fiscal 2018 are attributable to olathe ks facilities including the expansion project described in “item 2 properties”

 

financing activities 

 

  

the 1133 million decrease in cash used in financing activities in fiscal year 2017 compared to fiscal year 2016 was primarily due to decreased dividend payments of 985 million associated with an additional payment made in the 53week fiscal year 2016 and a decrease of purchases of treasury stock of 187 million under our share repurchase authorization

 

the 616 million increase in cash used in financing activities in fiscal year 2016 compared to fiscal year 2015 was primarily due to increased dividend payments of 1033 million associated with an additional payment made in the 53week fiscal year 2016 and the yearoveryear increase of our dividend rate partially offset by a decrease of purchases of treasury stock of 382 million under our share repurchase authorization

 

our declared dividend has increased from 048 per share for the four calendar quarters beginning in june 2014 to 051 per share for the twelve calendar quarters beginning in june 2015

  

contractual obligations and commercial commitments 

 

as of december 30 2017 operating leases comprise the substance of the company’s commercial commitments with longterm scheduled payments as summarized below

 

   

the company is party to certain other commitments which include purchases of raw materials advertising expenditures and other indirect purchases in connection with conducting our business the aggregate amount of purchase orders and other commitments open as of december 30 2017 was approximately 3134 million we cannot determine the aggregate amount of such purchase orders that represent contractual obligations because purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements our purchase orders are based on our current needs and are typically fulfilled within short periods of time

 

we may be required to make significant cash outlays related to unrecognized tax benefits however due to the uncertainty of the timing of future cash flows associated with our unrecognized tax benefits we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement if any with the respective taxing authorities accordingly unrecognized tax benefits of 1308 million as of december 30 2017 have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above for further information related to unrecognized tax benefits see note 2 “income taxes” to the consolidated financial statements included in this report

  



 

  

offbalance sheet arrangements 

 

we do not have any offbalance sheet arrangements

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

market sensitivity 

 

we have market risk primarily in connection with the pricing of our products and services and the purchase of raw materials product pricing and raw materials costs are both significantly influenced by semiconductor market conditions historically during cyclical industry downturns we have been able to offset pricing declines for our products through a combination of improved product mix and success in obtaining price reductions in raw materials costs

  

inflation 

 

we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our business financial condition or results of operations if our costs were to become subject to significant inflationary pressures we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs through price increases our inability or failure to do so could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations

 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

 

the operation of garmin’s subsidiaries in international markets results in exposure to movements in currency exchange rates we have experienced significant foreign currency gains and losses due to the strengthening and weakening of the us dollar the potential of volatile foreign exchange rate fluctuations in the future could have a significant effect on our results of operations the company has not historically hedged its foreign currency exchange rate risks

 

the currencies that create a majority of the company’s exchange rate exposure are the taiwan dollar euro and british pound sterling garmin corporation headquartered in xizhi taiwan uses the local currency as the functional currency the company translates all assets and liabilities at yearend exchange rates and income and expense accounts at average rates during the year in order to minimize the effect of the currency exchange fluctuations on our net assets we have elected to retain most of our taiwan subsidiary’s cash and investments in marketable securities denominated in us dollars

 

most european subsidiaries use the euro as the functional currency the functional currency of our largest european subsidiary garmin europe ltd remains the us dollar and as some transactions occurred in british pounds sterling or euros foreign currency gains or losses have been realized historically related to the movements of those currencies relative to the us dollar the company believes that gains and losses will become more material in the future as our european presence grows

 

during fiscal year 2017 the company incurred a net foreign currency loss of 226 million primarily due to the weakening of the us dollar against the taiwan dollar partially offset by the us dollar weakening against the euro and the british pound sterling during fiscal 2017 the us dollar weakened 94 against the taiwan dollar resulting in a loss of 559 million while the us dollar weakened 141 against the euro and 95 against the british pound sterling resulting in gains of 272 million and 31 million respectively the remaining net currency gain of 30 million is related to other currencies and timing of transactions these and other currency moves during fiscal year 2017 also resulted in a currency translation adjustment of 883 million within accumulated other comprehensive income

 



 

 

we assessed the company’s exposure to movements in currency exchange rates by performing a sensitivity analysis of adverse changes in exchange rates and the corresponding impact to our results of operations based on monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than respective functional currencies as of december 30 2017 and december 31 2016 hypothetical and reasonably possible adverse changes of 10 for the taiwan dollar euro and british pound sterling would have resulted in an adverse impact on income before income taxes of approximately 96 million and 92 million at december 30 2017 and december 31 2016

  

interest rate risk 

 

we have no outstanding longterm debt as of december 30 2017 we therefore have no meaningful debtrelated interest rate risk

 

we are exposed to interest rate risk in connection with our investments in marketable securities as interest rates change the unrealized gains and losses associated with those securities will fluctuate accordingly

 

the company’s investment policy targets low risk investments with the objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss the company does not intend to sell securities in an unrealized loss position and it is not more likely than not that the company will be required to sell such investments before recovery of their amortized costs bases which may be maturity during 2017 and 2016 the company did not record any material impairment charges on its outstanding securities

 

we assessed the company’s exposure to interest rate risk by performing a sensitivity analysis of a parallel shift in the yield curve and the corresponding impact to the company’s portfolio of marketable securities based on balance sheet positions as of december 30 2017 and december 31 2016 the hypothetical and reasonably possible 100 basis point increases in interest rates across all securities would have resulted in declines in portfolio fair market value of approximately 42 million and 45 million at december 30 2017 and december 30 2016 respectively such losses would only be realized if the company sold the investments prior to maturity

overview of the global positioning system 

  

the global positioning system is a worldwide navigation system which enables the precise determination of geographic location using established satellite technology the system consists of numerous constellations of orbiting satellites access to the systems is provided free of charge

 

garmin utilizes a variety of global navigation satellite systems gnss including but not limited to

       

the accuracy and utility of gps can be enhanced through augmentation techniques which compute any remaining errors in the signal and broadcast these corrections to a gps device the federal aviation administration “faa” has developed a wide area augmentation system waas comprising ground reference stations and additional satellites that improve the accuracy of gps positioning available in the united states and most of canada and mexico to approximately 3 meters waas supports the use of gps as the primary means of enroute terminal and approach navigation for aviation in the united states the increased accuracy offered by waas also enhances the utility of waasenabled gps receivers for consumer applications

competition 

  

in general we operate in highly competitive markets though competitive conditions do vary among our diverse products and geographies garmin believes the principal competitive factors impacting the market for its products are design functionality quality and reliability customer service brand price timetomarket and availability garmin believes that it generally competes favorably in each of these areas and as such is generally a significant competitor in each of our major markets

 

garmin believes that its principal competitors for portable automotive products are tomtom nv and mitac digital corporation mitac which distributes products under the brand names of magellan mio and navman garmin believes that its principal competitors for infotainment solutions are harman international industries panasonic corporation and the mitsubishi group garmin believes that its principal competitors for outdoor product lines are vista outdoor magellan a subsidiary of mitac sportdog brand and suunto oy garmin believes that its principal competitors for fitness products are apple inc samsung electronics co ltd bryton corp fitbit inc aliphcom dba jawbone polar electro oy sigma sports suunto oy and tomtom nv for marine products garmin believes that its principal competitors are furuno electronic company the humminbird division of johnson outdoors inc navico and flir systems inc for garmin’s aviation product lines garmin considers its principal competitors to be aspen avionics avidyne corporation cmc electronics free flight systems genesys aerosystems honeywell aerospace  defense innovative solutions and support inc l3 avionics systems rockwell collins inc sagem sa and universal avionics systems corporation

 

research and development 

 

garmin’s product innovations are driven by its strong emphasis on research and development and the close partnership between garmin’s engineering and manufacturing teams garmin’s products are created by its engineering and development staff which numbered approximately 3600 people worldwide as of december 31 2016 garmin’s manufacturing staff includes manufacturing process engineers who work closely with garmin’s design engineers to ensure manufacturability and manufacturing cost control for its products garmin’s development staff includes industrial designers as well as software engineers electrical engineers mechanical engineers and cartographic engineers garmin believes the industrial design of its products has played an important role in garmin’s success once a development project is initiated and approved a multidisciplinary team is created to design the product and transition it into manufacturing

 

below is a table of garmin’s expenditures on research and development over the last three fiscal years 

 

  

manufacturing and operations 

 

garmin believes one of its core competencies and strengths is its vertically integrated manufacturing capabilities at its taiwan facilities in xizhi jhongli and linkou its china facility in yangzhou and at its us facilities in olathe kansas and salem oregon garmin believes that its ownership and operation of its own manufacturing facilities and distribution networks provides significant capability and flexibility to address the breadth and depth of resources necessary to serve its diverse products and markets

 

specifically garmin believes that its vertical integration of its manufacturing capabilities provides advantages to product cost quality and time to market

 



 

 

cost garmin’s manufacturing resources rapidly and iteratively prototype designs concepts products and processes achieving higher efficiency resulting in lower cost garmin’s vertical integration approach enables leveraging our manufacturing resources across high mid and low volume products sharing of these resources across our product lines favorably affects garmin’s costs to produce its range of products with lower volume products realizing the economies of scale of the high volume products the ownership and integration of our resources allows garmin to optimize the design for manufacturing of our products yielding improved cost

 

quality garmin’s automation and sophisticated production processes provide inservice robustness and consistent reliability standards that enables garmin to maintain strict process and quality control of the products manufactured thereby improving the overall quality of our products additionally the immediate feedback throughout the manufacturing processes is provided to the development teams providing integrated continuous improvement throughout design and supply chain

 

time to market garmin uses multidisciplinary teams of design engineers process engineers and supply chain specialists to develop products allowing them to quickly move from concept to manufacturing this integrated ownership provides inherent flexibility to enable faster time to market

 

garmin’s design manufacturing distribution and servicing processes in its us taiwan china and uk facilities are certified to iso 9001 an international quality standard developed by the international organization for standardization garmin’s automotive operations in taiwan china and olathe have achieved ts 16949 certification a quality standard for automotive suppliers garmin’s olathe and salem aviation operations have achieved certification to as9100 the quality standard for the aviation industry

 

garmin international inc garmin europe ltd and garmin corporation have also achieved certification of their environmental management systems to the iso 14001 standard recognizing garmin’s systems and processes which minimize or prevent harmful effects on the environment and continually strive to improve its environmental performance

 

materials 

 

although most components essential to garmin’s business are generally available from multiple sources certain key components are currently obtained by the company from single or limited sources which subjects garmin to supply and pricing risks many of these and other key components that are available from multiple sources including but not limited to nand flash memory dynamic random access memory dram gps chipsets and certain lcds are subject at times to industrywide shortages and commodity pricing fluctuations

 

garmin and other participants in the personal computer tablet mobile communication aviation electronics and consumer electronics industries also compete for various components with other industries that have experienced increased demand for their products in addition garmin uses some custom components that are not common to the rest of the personal computer tablet mobile communication and consumer electronics industries and new products introduced by the company often utilize custom components available from only one source until garmin has evaluated whether there is a need for and subsequently qualifies additional suppliers when a component or product uses new technologies initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields have matured or manufacturing capacity has increased garmin makes efforts to manage risks in these areas through the use of supply agreements for strategically important components nevertheless if garmin’s supply of a key singlesourced component for a new or existing product was delayed or constrained if such components were available only at significantly higher prices or if a key manufacturing vendor delayed shipments of completed products to garmin garmin’s financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected garmin’s business and financial performance could also be adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the original source or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source continued availability of these components at acceptable prices or at all may be affected if those suppliers decided to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet garmin’s requirements

  



 

  

seasonality 

  

our net sales are subject to seasonal fluctuation sales of our consumer products are generally higher in the fourth quarter due to increased demand during the holiday buying season and to a lesser extent the second quarter due to increased demand during the spring and summer season sales of consumer products are also influenced by the timing of the release of new products our aviation products do not experience much seasonal variation but are more influenced by the timing of aircraft certifications and the release of new products when the initial demand is typically the strongest

  

backlog 

 

our sales are generally of a consumer nature and there is a relatively short cycle between order and shipment therefore we believe that backlog information is not material to the understanding of our business we typically ship most orders within 72 hours of receipt

  

intellectual property 

  

our success and ability to compete is dependent in part on our proprietary technology we rely on a combination of patent copyright trademark and trade secret laws as well as confidentiality agreements to establish and protect our proprietary rights in addition garmin often relies on licenses of intellectual property for use in its business for example garmin obtains licenses for digital cartography technology for use in our products from various sources

 

as of january 17 2017 garmin’s worldwide ip portfolio includes over 1050 patent and 700 trademark registrations the duration of foreign patents varies in accordance with the provisions of applicable local law we believe that our continued success depends on the intellectual skills of our employees and their ability to continue to innovate garmin will continue to file and prosecute patent applications when appropriate to attempt to protect garmin’s rights in its proprietary technologies 

 

there is no assurance that our current patents or patents which we may later acquire may successfully withstand any challenge in whole or in part it is also possible that any patent issued to us may not provide us with any competitive advantages or that the patents of others will preclude us from manufacturing and marketing certain products despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights to protect our trade secrets to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others or to defend against claims of infringement or invalidity

  

regulations 

  

the telecommunications industry is highly regulated and the regulatory environment in which garmin operates is subject to change in accordance with the united states’ federal communications commission fcc rules and regulations wireless transceiver products are required to be certified by the fcc and comparable authorities in foreign countries where they are sold garmin’s products sold in europe are required to comply with relevant directives of the european commission a delay in receiving required certifications for new products or enhancements to garmin’s products or losing certification for garmin’s existing products could adversely affect our business in addition aviation products that are intended for installation in “type certificated aircraft” are required to be certified by the faa its european counterpart the european aviation safety agency and other comparable organizations before they can be used in an aircraft

 



 

 

because garmin corporation one of the company’s principal subsidiaries is located in taiwan foreign exchange control laws and regulations of taiwan with respect to remittances into and out of taiwan may have an impact on garmin’s operations the taiwan foreign exchange control statute and regulations thereunder provides that all foreign exchange transactions must be executed by banks designated to handle such business by the ministry of finance of taiwan and by the central bank of the republic of china taiwan also referred to as the cbc current regulations favor traderelated foreign exchange transactions consequently foreign currency earned from exports of merchandise and services may now be retained and used freely by exporters while all foreign currency needed for the import of merchandise and services may be purchased freely from the designated foreign exchange banks aside from traderelated foreign exchange transactions taiwan companies and residents may without foreign exchange approval remit outside and into taiwan foreign currencies of up to 50 million and 5 million respectively or their equivalent each calendar year currency conversions within the limits are processed by the designated banks and do not have to be reviewed and approved by the cbc the above limits apply to remittances involving a conversion between taiwan dollars and us dollars or other foreign currencies the cbc typically approves foreign exchange in excess of the limits if a party applies with the cbc for review and presents legitimate business reasons justifying the currency conversion a requirement is also imposed on all enterprises to register all medium and longterm foreign debt with the cbc

 

environmental matters 

 

garmin’s operations are subject to various environmental laws including laws addressing air and water pollution and management of hazardous substances and wastes substantial noncompliance with applicable environmental laws could have a material adverse effect on our business capital expenditures for environmental controls are included in our normal capital budget

 

environmental regulation of garmin’s products is increasing many of garmins products are subject to laws relating to the chemical and material composition of our products and their energy efficiency garmin is also subject to laws requiring manufacturers to be financially responsible for collection recovery and recycling of wastes from certain electronic products compliance with current environmental laws does not have a material impact on our business but the impact of future enactment of environmental laws cannot yet be fully determined and could be substantial

 

garmin has implemented multiple environmental management system ems policies in accordance with the international organization for standardization iso 14001 standard for environmental health and safety management garmin’s ems policies set forth practices standards and procedures to ensure compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations at garmin’s kansas headquarters facility garmin’s european headquarters facility and garmin’s taiwan manufacturing facility

 

regulatory and “green procurement” demands from our customers are also increasing particularly in the areas of restricted substance use and environmentallyfriendly design and manufacture initiatives the overall impacts of these customer requirements cannot yet be established garmin is committed to improving our products and processes to meet our customer needs

 

employees 

  

as of december 31 2016 garmin had approximately 11600 full and parttime employees worldwide of whom approximately 4400 were in the united states 100 were in canada 5000 were in taiwan 1300 were in europe and 800 were in other global locations except for some of garmin’s employees in brazil and sweden none of garmin’s employees are represented by a labor union and none of garmins north american or taiwan employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement garmin considers its employee relations to be positive 

 



 

 




 item 1a risk factors 

  

the risks described below are not the only ones facing our company additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also impair our business operations if any of the following risks occur our business financial condition or operating results could be materially adversely affected 

  

risks related to the company 

  

if we are not successful in the continued development timely manufacture and introduction of new products or product categories demand for our products could decrease to the extent that lost sales and profits from declining segments or product categories are not entirely offset 

  

we expect that a significant portion of our future revenue will continue to be derived from sales of newly introduced products this is particularly important to replace sales and profits lost in declining segments or product categories the market for our products is characterized by rapidly changing technology evolving industry standards and changes in customer needs if we fail to introduce new products or to modify or improve our existing products in response to changes in technology industry standards or customer needs our products could rapidly become less competitive or obsolete we must continue to make significant investments in research and development in order to continue to develop new products enhance existing products and achieve market acceptance for such products however there can be no assurance that development stage products will be successfully completed or if developed will achieve significant customer acceptance

 

if we are unable to successfully develop and introduce competitive new products and enhance our existing products our future results of operations would be adversely affected our pursuit of necessary technology may require substantial time and expense we may need to license new technologies to respond to technological change these licenses may not be available to us on terms that we can accept or may materially change the gross profits that we are able to obtain on our products we may not succeed in adapting our products to new technologies as they emerge development and manufacturing schedules for technology products are difficult to predict and there can be no assurance that we will achieve timely initial customer shipments of new products the timely availability of these products in volume and their acceptance by customers are important to our future success any future challenges related to new products whether due to product development delays manufacturing delays lack of market acceptance delays in regulatory approval or otherwise could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations

  

if we are unable to compete effectively with existing or new competitors our resulting loss of competitive position could result in price reductions fewer customer orders reduced margins and loss of market share 

  

the markets for many of our products are highly competitive and we expect competition to increase in the future some of our competitors have significantly greater financial technical and marketing resources than we do these competitors may be able to respond more rapidly to new or emerging technologies or changes in customer requirements they may also be able to devote greater resources to the development promotion and sale of their products or secure better product positioning with retailers increased competition could result in price reductions fewer customer orders reduced margins and loss of market share our failure to compete successfully against current or future competitors could seriously harm our business financial condition and results of operations

 

maturation or contraction of the market for wearable devices could adversely affect our revenue and profits 

  

we have experienced growth in sales and profits in our outdoor and fitness segments which in recent years have benefited from increased sales of wearable devices if the wearable device market declines or categories of devices within the wearable device market decline such as fitness trackers or smartwatches our business financial condition or operating results could be materially adversely affected

  

the demand for personal navigation devices pnds has been and continues to be reduced by replacement technologies becoming available on mobile devices and factoryinstalled systems in new autos as well as by market saturation 

  

gpsnavigation technologies have been incorporated into competing devices such as mobile handsets tablets and new automobiles through factoryinstalled systems many companies are now offering navigation software for these mobile devices the acceptance of this technology by consumers has reduced sales in this segment and has reduced profits in some periods navigation systems are also becoming more prevalent as standard andor optional equipment on new automobiles increased navigation penetration on mobile handsets and in new automobiles is expected to cause further declines in sales of our portable navigation devices and could further reduce profits

  



 

  

the auto segment which represents approximately 29 of our revenues is expected to continue to decline in 2017 

  

we experienced substantial growth through 2008 in the auto segment of our business as pnds became massmarket consumer electronics in both europe and north america this market is declining as competing technologies emerged and market saturation occurred this has resulted in and is expected to continue to result in periods of lower revenues and profits for this segment

    

our annual and quarterly financial statements will reflect fluctuations in foreign currency translation 

 

the operation of our subsidiaries in international markets results in exposure to movements in currency exchange rates we have experienced significant foreign currency gains and losses due to the strengthening and weakening of the us dollar relative to certain other currencies the potential of volatile foreign exchange rate fluctuations in the future could have a significant effect on our results of operations we have not historically hedged our foreign currency exchange rate risks

 

the currencies that typically create a majority of our exchange rate exposure are the taiwan dollar euro and british pound sterling the taiwan dollar is the functional currency of garmin corporation the us dollar is the functional currency of garmin europe ltd and the euro is the functional currency of most of our other european subsidiaries although some transactions and balances are denominated in british pounds other legal entities primarily use the local currency as the functional currency due to the relative size of entities using a functional currency other than the taiwan dollar euro and british pound sterling fluctuations of other currencies are not expected to have a material impact on our financial statements

 

we translate income and expense activity at the approximate rate of exchange at the transaction date and all assets and liabilities at the rate of exchange in effect at the balance sheet date income and expense activity in a currency other than the us dollar can be impacted by exchange rate variations over time the majority of our consolidated foreign currency gain or loss is typically driven by exchange rate impacts on the significant cash receivables and payables held in a currency other than the functional currency at a given legal entity such gain or loss will create variations in our earnings per share however because there is minimal cash impact caused by such exchange rate variations management will continue to focus on our operating performance before the impact of foreign currency gains and losses

 

changes in applicable tax laws or resolutions of tax disputes could result in adverse tax consequences to the company 

 

our tax position could be adversely impacted by changes in swiss united states or foreign tax laws tax treaties or tax regulations or the interpretation or enforcement thereof by any tax authority we cannot predict the outcome of any specific legislative proposals legislative proposals are being considered in switzerland that could make significant changes in the corporate tax regime and increase the taxes applicable to us in switzerland corporate reform being considered in the united states could significantly change our tax liability such as proposals to remove certain domestic deductions implement border adjustments andor broaden the circumstances under which foreign corporations could be considered resident in the united states moreover international taxing standards continue to evolve as a result of the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd recommendations aimed at preventing perceived base erosion and profit shifting by multinational corporations while these recommendations are not changes to tax law the countries where we operate may implement legislation or take unilateral actions which may result in adverse effects to our income tax provision and financial statements   

  

significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes in the ordinary course of our business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain we are regularly under audit by tax authorities although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals the results of an audit or litigation could have a material effect on our income tax provision net income or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made

 

restrictions on trade particularly on goods imported from taiwan or the people’s republic of china could significantly harm our results of operations 

  

a significant portion of our global and us sales are comprised of goods assembled and manufactured in our facilities in taiwan and the prc the imposition of additional us or foreign governmental controls regulations that create new or enhanced restrictions on free trade with the us or increases in tariffs on goods imported into the us including goods imported from china and taiwan could have substantial adverse effects on our business operations results of operations and financial condition

  

economic regulatory and political conditions and uncertainty could adversely affect our revenue and profits 

  

our revenue and profits depend significantly on general economic conditions and the demand for products in the markets in which we compete economic weakness or constrained consumer and business spending has resulted in periods of decreased revenue and in the future could result in decreased revenue and problems with our ability to manage inventory levels and collect customer receivables in addition financial difficulties experienced by our retailers and oem customers have resulted and could result in the future in significant bad debt writeoffs and additions to reserves in our receivables and could have an adverse effect on our results of operations

 

the united kingdom uk held a referendum on june 23 2016 in which a majority of voters voted to exit the european union eu due to the unprecedented nature of the expected withdrawal significant uncertainty exists surrounding the timing and terms of the expected exit we have operations in the uk and several eu member states whose currencies namely british pound sterling gbp and euro economies taxation and trade regulation among other factors could be adversely impacted by the negotiations and outcomes of the uk’s leaving the eu which is likely to be a lengthy and complicated process these events could have a material adverse effect on our business operations results of operations and financial condition

 



 

 

if we do not correctly anticipate demand for our products we may not be able to secure sufficient quantities or costeffective production of our products or we could have costly excess production or inventories 

  

we have generally been able to increase or decrease production to meet fluctuations in demand however the demand for our products depends on many factors and may be difficult to forecast we expect that it will become more difficult to forecast demand as we introduce and support a diverse product portfolio as competition in the market for our products intensifies and as the markets for some of our products mature significant unanticipated fluctuations in demand could cause the following problems in our operations

 

  

  

  

we depend on our suppliers some of which are the sole source for specific components and our production would be seriously harmed if these suppliers are not able to meet our demand and alternative sources are not available or if the costs of components rise 

  

we are dependent on third party suppliers for various components used in our current products some of the components that we procure from third party suppliers include semiconductors and electroluminescent panels liquid crystal displays memory chips batteries and microprocessors the cost quality and availability of components are essential to the successful production and sale of our products some components we use are from sole source suppliers certain applicationspecific integrated circuits incorporating our proprietary designs are manufactured for us by sole source suppliers alternative sources may not be currently available for these sole source components

 

in the past we have experienced shortages of certain components in addition if there are shortages in supply of components the costs of such components may rise if suppliers are unable to meet our demand for components on a timely basis and if we are unable to obtain an alternative source or if the price of the alternative source is prohibitive or if the costs of components rise our ability to maintain timely and costeffective production of our products would be seriously harmed

  

gross margins for our products may fluctuate or erode 

  

gross margins in some of our segments have declined in recent years and could further decline in the future due to competitive price reductions that are not fully offset by material cost reductions in addition our overall gross margin may fluctuate from period to period due to a number of factors including product mix competition and unit volumes in particular the average selling prices of a specific product tend to decrease over that product’s life to offset such decreases we intend to rely primarily on component cost reduction obtaining yield improvements and corresponding cost reductions in the manufacturing of existing products and on introducing new products that incorporate advanced features and therefore can be sold at higher average selling prices however there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain any such yield improvements or cost reductions or introduce any such new products in the future to the extent that such cost reductions and new product introductions do not occur in a timely manner or our products do not achieve market acceptance our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected

 



 

 

changes in our united states federal income tax classification could result in adverse tax consequences to our shareholders 

  

we do not believe that we or any of our united states or nonunited states subsidiaries are currently a ‘‘passive foreign investment company’’ for united states federal income tax purposes we do not expect to become a passive foreign investment company however because the passive foreign investment company determination is made annually based on whether the company’s income or assets meet certain thresholds as determined under united states federal tax principles which are based on facts and circumstances that may be beyond our control we cannot assure that we will not become a passive foreign investment company in the future if we are a passive foreign investment company in any year then any of our shareholders that is a united states person could be liable to pay tax on their pro rata share of our income plus an interest charge upon some distributions by us or when that shareholder sells our common shares at a gain further if we are classified as a passive foreign investment company in any year in which a united states person is a shareholder we generally will continue to be treated as a passive foreign investment company with respect to such shareholder in all succeeding years regardless of whether we continue to satisfy the income or asset tests mentioned above

 

we do not believe that we or any of our united states or nonunited states subsidiaries are currently a controlled foreign corporation cfc for united states federal income tax purposes we do not expect to become a cfc the cfc determination is made daily based on whether the united states shareholders own more than fifty percent of the voting power or value of the company only united states persons that own ten percent or more of the voting power of the company’s shares qualify as united states shareholders currently the company has two shareholders that qualify as united states shareholders owning greater than ten percent of the voting power totaling 36 of the outstanding shares thus the addition of even one additional ten percent or greater united states shareholder could result in classification as a cfc and subject all such holders to significant tax consequences if the company were to be classified as a cfc for an uninterrupted thirtyday period in any year the company’s shareholders that qualify as united states shareholders could be liable to pay us income tax at ordinary income tax rates on their prorata share of certain categories of the company’s income for the period in which the company is classified as a cfc as the company cannot control the ownership of the company’s stock nor can the company control which shareholders participate in the company’s stock buyback program ownership changes could result that create united states shareholders which increase the risk of garmin being treated as a cfc

 



 

 

we may experience unique economic and political risks associated with companies that operate in taiwan 

  

our principal manufacturing facilities where we manufacture most of our consumer products are located in taiwan relations between taiwan and the people’s republic of china also referred to as the prc and other factors affecting the political or economic conditions of taiwan in the future could materially affect our business financial condition and results of operations and the market price and the liquidity of our shares

 

the prc asserts sovereignty over all of china including taiwan certain other islands and all of mainland china the prc government does not recognize the legitimacy of the taiwan government although significant economic and cultural relations have been established during recent years between taiwan and the prc the prc government has indicated that it may use military force to gain control over taiwan in certain circumstances such as the declaration of independence by taiwan the united states relations with taiwan are governed by the 1979 taiwan relations act which signifies when the us switched diplomatic recognition from taiwan to the prc referred to as the onechina policy deviations from the onechina policy could lead to adverse changes in chinaus and chinataiwan relations and could adversely affect our operations in taiwan in the future

  

our intellectual property rights are important to our operations and we could suffer loss if they infringe upon other’s rights or are infringed upon by others 

  

we rely on a combination of patents copyrights trademarks and trade secrets confidentiality provisions and licensing arrangements to establish and protect our proprietary rights to this end we hold rights to a number of patents and registered trademarks and regularly file applications to attempt to protect our rights in new technology and trademarks however there is no guarantee that our patent applications will become issued patents or that our trademark applications will become registered trademarks moreover even if approved our patents or trademarks may thereafter be successfully challenged by others or otherwise become invalidated for a variety of reasons thus any patents or trademarks we currently have or may later acquire may not provide us a significant competitive advantage

 

third parties may claim that we are infringing their intellectual property rights such claims could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition from time to time we receive letters alleging infringement of patents trademarks or other intellectual property rights and we have been and currently are a defendant in lawsuits alleging patent infringement litigation concerning patents or other intellectual property is costly and time consuming we may seek licenses from such parties but they could refuse to grant us a license or demand commercially unreasonable terms such infringement claims could also cause us to incur substantial liabilities and to suspend or permanently cease the use of critical technologies or processes or the production or sale of major products

 



 

 

we may become subject to significant product liability costs 

  

if our aviation products malfunction or contain errors or defects airplane collisions or crashes could occur resulting in property damage personal injury or death malfunctions or errors or defects in our marine navigational products could cause boats to run aground or cause other wreckage personal injury or death if our automotive or marine products contain defects or errors in the mapping supplied by thirdparty map providers or if our users do not heed our warnings about the proper use of these products collisions or accidents could occur resulting in property damage personal injury or death if any of these events occurs we could be subject to significant liability for personal injury and property damage and under certain circumstances could be subject to a judgment for punitive damages we maintain insurance against accidentrelated risks involving our products however there can be no assurance that such insurance would be sufficient to cover the cost of damages to others or that such insurance will continue to be available at commercially reasonable rates in addition insurance coverage may not cover awards of punitive damages and may not cover the cost of associated legal fees and defense costs which could result in lower margins if we are unable to maintain sufficient insurance to cover product liability costs or if our insurance coverage does not cover the award this could have a materially adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations

 

we have claims and lawsuits against us that may result in adverse outcomes 

 

we are subject to a variety of claims and lawsuits adverse outcomes in some or all of these claims may result in significant monetary damages or injunctive relief that could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business litigation and other claims are subject to inherent uncertainties and the outcomes can be difficult to predict management may not adequately reserve for a contingent liability or we may suffer unforeseen liabilities which could then impact the results of a financial period a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements could occur for the period in which the effect of an unfavorable final outcome becomes probable and reasonably estimable which if not expected could harm our results of operations and financial condition

  

we collect store process and use personal information and other customer data which subjects us to governmental regulation and other legal obligations related to privacy information security and data protection and our actual or perceived failure to comply with such obligations could harm our business 

 

we collect store process and use personal information and other user data our users’ fitnessrelated data and personal information may include among other information names addresses phone numbers email addresses payment account information height weight age heart rates sleeping patterns gpsbased location and activity patterns due to the volume and types of the personal information and data we manage and the nature of our products the security features of our platform and information systems are critical if our security measures or applications are breached disrupted or fail unauthorized persons may be able to obtain access to user data if we or our thirdparty service providers business partners or thirdparty apps with which our users choose to share their garmin data were to experience a breach disruption or failure of systems compromising our users’ data or the media suggested that our security measures or those of our thirdparty service providers were insufficient our brand and reputation could be adversely affected use of our products and services could decrease and we could be exposed to a risk of loss litigation and regulatory proceedings depending on the nature of the information compromised in the event of a data breach disruption or other unauthorized access to our user data we may also have obligations to notify users about the incident and we may need to provide some form of remedy for the individuals affected by the incident a growing number of legislative and regulatory bodies have adopted consumer notification requirements in the event of unauthorized access to or acquisition of certain types of personal data such breach notification laws continue to evolve and may be inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another complying with these obligations could cause us to incur substantial costs and could increase negative publicity surrounding any incident that compromises user data our users may also accidentally disclose or lose control of their passwords creating the perception that our systems or those of our thirdparty service providers are not secure against thirdparty access additionally if third parties we work with such as vendors business partners service providers or developers violate applicable laws agreements or our policies such violations may also put our users’ information at risk and could in turn have an adverse effect on our business while we maintain insurance coverage that subject to policy terms and conditions and a significant selfinsured retention is designed to address certain aspects of cyber risks such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise in the continually evolving area of cyber risk

 



 

 

regulatory authorities around the world are considering a number of legislative and regulatory proposals concerning data protection and a newly adopted data protection regulation in the eu will go into effect in may 2018 in addition the interpretation and application of consumer and data protection laws in the us europe and elsewhere are sometimes uncertain and in flux it is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our interpretation and data practices if so in addition to the possibility of fines this could result in an order requiring that we change our data practices which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations complying with these various laws could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business

 

security breaches and other disruptions including as a result of cyber attacks may harm our reputation and adversely affect our business and results of operations 

 

in the ordinary course of our business we electronically maintain sensitive data including intellectual property our proprietary business information and that of our customers and suppliers and some personally identifiable information of our customers and employees in our facilities and on our networks the secure processing maintenance and transmission of this information is important to our operations a breach of our security systems and procedures or those of our vendors could result in significant data losses or theft of our customers or our employees intellectual property proprietary business information or personally identifiable information a cybersecurity breach could negatively affect our reputation as a trusted product and service provider by adversely affecting the markets perception of the security or reliability of our products or services 

 

we have technology and processes in place to detect and respond to data security incidents however because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access disable or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently and may be difficult to detect for long periods of time we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventive measures in addition hardware software or applications we develop or procure from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture or other problems that could unexpectedly compromise information security unauthorized parties may also attempt to gain access to our systems or facilities through fraud trickery or other forms of deceiving our customers and employees accordingly we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate security barriers or other preventative measures or if such measures are implemented and even with appropriate training conducted in support of such measures human errors may still occur it is virtually impossible for us to entirely mitigate this risk a party whether internal or external who is able to circumvent our security measures could misappropriate information

 

actual or anticipated attacks and risks may cause us to incur increasing costs including costs to deploy additional personnel and protection technologies to train employees and to engage third party security experts and consultants our technology errors and omissions insurance may not protect against all of the costs liabilities and other adverse effects arising from a security breach or system failure if we fail to reasonably maintain the security of confidential information we may suffer significant reputational and financial losses and our results of operations cash flows financial condition and liquidity may be adversely affected in addition a system breach could result in other negative consequences including disruption of internal operations and may subject us to private litigation government investigations enforcement actions and cause us to incur potentially significant liability damages or remediation costs

 

we depend on third party licensors for the digital map data contained in our auto products and our business andor gross margins could be harmed if we become unable to continue licensing such mapping data or if the royalty costs for such data rise 

  

we license digital mapping data for use in our products from various sources there are only a limited number of suppliers of mapping data for each geographical region the two largest digital map suppliers are here formerly known as navteq and tomtom nv here is owned by here acquisition bv a consortium of daimler ag bmw ag and audi ag here acquisition bv and tomtom nv are also competitors of garmin

 

although we do not foresee difficulty in continuing to license data at reasonable pricing due to a long term license agreement between garmin and here extending through 2024 if we are unable to continue licensing such mapping data and are unable to obtain an alternative source or if the nature of our relationships with here changes detrimentally our ability to supply mapping data for use in our products would be seriously harmed

  



 

 

failure to obtain required certifications of our products on a timely basis could harm our business 

  

we have certain products especially in our aviation segment that are subject to governmental and similar certifications before they can be sold for example faa certification is required for all of our aviation products that are intended for installation in typecertificated aircraft to the extent required certification is an expensive and timeconsuming process that requires significant focus and resources an inability to obtain or excessive delay in obtaining such certifications could have an adverse effect on our ability to introduce new products and for certain aviation oem products our customers’ ability to sell airplanes delays in our obtaining certification for our aviation products have resulted and may in the future result in our being required to pay compensation to our customers therefore such inabilities or delays could adversely affect our operating results in addition we cannot assure that our certified products will not be decertified any such decertification could have an adverse effect on our operating results

  

our business may suffer if we are not able to hire and retain sufficient qualified personnel or if we lose our key personnel 

  

our future success depends partly on the continued contribution of our key executive engineering sales marketing manufacturing and administrative personnel we currently do not have employment agreements with any of our key executive officers swiss law prohibits us from paying severance payments to our senior executive officers which may impair our ability to recruit for these positions we do not have key person life insurance on any of our key executive officers and do not currently intend to obtain such insurance the loss of the services of any of our senior level management or other key employees could harm our business recruiting and retaining the skilled personnel we require to maintain and grow our market position may be difficult for example in some recent years there has been a nationwide shortage of qualified engineers in the united states who are necessary for us to design and develop new products and therefore it has sometimes been challenging to recruit such personnel if we fail to hire and retain qualified employees we may not be able to maintain and expand our business

 

our quarterly operating results are subject to fluctuations and seasonality 

  

our operating results are difficult to predict our future quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly if such operating results decline the price of our stock could decline as we have expanded our operations our operating expenses particularly our research and development costs have increased as a percentage of our sales in some periods if revenues decrease and we continue to increase research and development costs our operating results would be negatively affected

 

historically our revenues have been weaker in the first quarter of each fiscal year as our devices are highly consumeroriented and consumer buying is traditionally lower in this quarter sales of certain of our fitness outdoor marine and automotive products tend to be higher in our second fiscal quarter due to increased consumer spending for such products in the spring season and travel season sales of many of our consumer products also have been higher in our fourth fiscal quarter due to increased consumer spending patterns on electronic devices during the holiday season in addition we attempt to time our new product releases to coincide with relatively higher consumer spending in the second and fourth fiscal quarters which contributes to these seasonal variations

  



 

  

we rely on independent dealers and distributors to sell our products and disruption to these channels would harm our business 

  

because we sell many of our products to independent dealers and distributors we are subject to many risks including risks related to their inventory levels and support for our products in particular our dealers and distributors maintain significant levels of our products in their inventories if dealers and distributors attempt to reduce their levels of inventory or if they do not maintain sufficient levels to meet customer demand our sales could be negatively impacted

 

many of our dealers and distributors also sell products offered by our competitors if our competitors offer our dealers and distributors more favorable terms those dealers and distributors may deemphasize or decline to carry our products in the future we may not be able to retain or attract a sufficient number of qualified dealers and distributors if we are unable to maintain successful relationships with dealers and distributors or to expand our distribution channels our business will suffer

  

we may pursue strategic acquisitions investments strategic partnerships or other ventures and our business could be materially harmed if we fail to successfully identify complete and integrate such transactions 

  

we intend to evaluate acquisition opportunities and opportunities to make investments in complementary businesses technologies services or products or to enter into strategic partnerships with parties who can provide access to those assets additional product or services offerings additional distribution or marketing synergies or additional industry expertise we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition investment or strategic partnership candidates or if we do identify suitable candidates in the future we may not be able to complete those transactions on commercially favorable terms or at all

 

any past or future acquisition could also result in difficulties assimilating acquired employees operations and products and diversion of capital and management’s attention away from other business issues and opportunities integration of acquired companies may result in problems related to integration of technology and inexperienced management teams in addition the key personnel of the acquired company may decide not to work for us we may not successfully integrate internal controls compliance under the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 and other corporate governance matters operations personnel or products related to acquisitions we may make in the future if we fail to successfully integrate such transactions our business could be materially harmed

 

there is uncertainty as to our shareholders’ ability to enforce certain foreign civil liabilities in switzerland and taiwan 

  

we are a swiss company and a substantial portion of our assets are located outside the united states particularly in taiwan as a result it may be difficult to effect service of process within the united states upon us in addition there is uncertainty as to whether the courts of switzerland or taiwan would recognize or enforce judgments of united states courts obtained against us predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the united states or any state thereof or be competent to hear original actions brought in switzerland or taiwan against us predicated upon the securities laws of the united states or any state thereof

 

a shut down of federal aviation administration operations would harm our business 

  

any failure of the united states congress to appropriate funds for faa operations that results in any shut down of faa operations or furloughing of faa employees could result in delays in the required faa certification of our avionics products and in the production sale and registration of aircraft that use our avionics products such delays could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results

 



 

 

many of our products rely on the global positioning system 

  

the global positioning system gps is a satellitebased navigation and positioning system consisting of a constellation of orbiting satellites the satellites and their ground control and monitoring stations are maintained and operated by the united states department of defense the department of defense does not currently charge users for access to the satellite signals these satellites and their ground support systems are complex electronic systems subject to electronic and mechanical failures and possible sabotage the satellites were originally designed to have lives of 75 years and are subject to damage by the hostile space environment in which they operate however of the current deployment of satellites in place some have been operating for more than 20 years

 

to repair damaged or malfunctioning satellites is currently not economically feasible if a significant number of satellites were to become inoperable there could be a substantial delay before they are replaced with new satellites a reduction in the number of operating satellites may impair the current utility of the gps system and the growth of current and additional market opportunities gps satellites and ground control segments are being modernized gps modernization software updates can cause problems we depend on public access to open technical specifications in advance of gps updates

 

gps is operated by the us government which is committed to maintenance and improvement of gps however if the policy were to change and gps were no longer supported by the us government or if user fees were imposed it could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition

 

some of our products also use signals from satellite based augmentation systems sbas that augment gps such as the us wide area augmentation system waas japanese mtsatbased satellite augmentation system msas global navigation satellite system glonass and european geostationary navigation overlay service egnos any curtailment of sbas operating capability could result in decreased user capability for many of our aviation products thereby impacting our markets

 

any of the foregoing factors could affect the willingness of buyers of our products to select global positioning systembased products instead of products based on competing technologies

 

our business is subject to disruptions and uncertainties caused by geopolitical instability war or terrorism 

 

acts of war or acts of terrorism especially any directed at the gps signals could have a material adverse impact on our business operating results and financial condition the threat of terrorism and war and heightened security and military response to this threat or any future acts of terrorism may cause a redeployment of the satellites used in gps or interruptions of the system to the extent that such interruptions have an effect on sales of our products this could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition

  

a shut down of airspace or imposition of restrictions on general aviation would harm our business the shutdown of airspace could cause reduced sales of our general aviation products and delays in the shipment of our products manufactured in our taiwan manufacturing facilities to our global distribution facilities thereby adversely affecting our ability to supply new and existing products to our dealers and distributors

 

any reallocation or repurposing of radio frequency spectrum could cause harmful interference with the reception of global positioning system signals this interference could harm our business 

  

our global positioning system technology is dependent on the use of the standard positioning service sps provided by the us government’s global positioning system satellites the global positioning system operates in radio frequency bands that are globally allocated for radio navigation satellite services international allocations of radio frequency are made by the international telecommunications union itu a specialized technical agency of the united nations these allocations are further governed by radio regulations that have treaty status and which may be subject to modification every two to three years by the world radio communication conference each country also has regulatory authority on how each band is used in the united states the federal communications commission fcc and the national telecommunications and information administration ntia share responsibility for radio frequency allocations and spectrum usage regulations

 



 

 

any itu or national reallocation of radio frequency spectrum including frequency band segmentation or sharing of spectrum or other modifications of the permitted uses of relevant frequency bands may materially and adversely affect the utility and reliability of our products and have significant negative impacts on our business and our customers

  

we may be exposed to certain regulatory and financial risks related to climate change 

 

various regulatory and legislative measures to address greenhouse gas emissions are in different phases of implementation or discussion in the aftermath of its 2009 “endangerment finding” that greenhouse gas emissions pose a threat to human health and welfare the environmental protection agency has begun to regulate greenhouse gas emissions under the authority granted to it under the clean air act at the federal legislative level congressional passage of legislation adopting some form of federal mandatory greenhouse gas emission reduction such as a nationwide capandtrade program does not appear likely at this time although it could be adopted at a future date it is also possible that the us congress may pass alternative climate change bills that do not mandate a nationwide capandtrade program and instead focus on promoting renewable energy and energy efficiency which could increase the cost of doing business 

 

because it is uncertain what laws and regulations will be enacted we cannot predict the potential impact of such laws and regulations on our future consolidated financial condition results of operations or cash flows

  

risks relating to our shares 

 

the volatility of our stock price could adversely affect investment in our common shares 

 

the market price of our common shares has been and may continue to be highly volatile during 2016 the closing price of our common shares ranged from a low of 3229 to a high of 5575 a variety of factors could cause the price of our common shares to fluctuate perhaps substantially including

 

            

  



 

 

in addition in recent years the stock market in general and the markets for shares of technology companies in particular have experienced extreme price fluctuations which have often been unrelated to the operating performance of affected companies any such fluctuations in the future could adversely affect the market price of our common shares

  

our officers and directors exert substantial influence over us 

  

as of january 18 2017 current members and former members of our board of directors and our executive officers together with members of their families and entities that may be deemed affiliates of or related to such persons or entities beneficially owned approximately 4136 of our outstanding common shares accordingly these shareholders may be able to determine the outcome of corporate actions requiring shareholder approval such as mergers and acquisitions and shareholder proposals this level of ownership may have a significant effect in delaying deferring or preventing a change in control of garmin and may adversely affect the voting and other rights of other holders of our common shares

  

the rights of our shareholders are governed by swiss law 

 

the rights of our shareholders are governed by swiss law and garmin ltd’s articles of association the rights of shareholders under swiss law differ from the rights of shareholders of companies incorporated in other jurisdictions for example swiss law allows our shareholders acting at a shareholders’ meeting to authorize share capital that can be issued by the board of directors without approval of a shareholders’ meeting but this authorization is limited to 50 of the existing registered share capital and must be renewed at a shareholders’ meeting at least every two years for it to continue to be available additionally subject to specified exceptions including the exceptions described in our articles of association swiss law grants preemptive rights to existing shareholders to subscribe for new issuances of shares and other securities swiss law also does not provide as much flexibility in the various terms that can attach to different classes of shares as the laws of some other jurisdictions swiss law also reserves for approval by shareholders certain corporate actions over which a board of directors would have authority in some other jurisdictions for example swiss law provides that dividends and other distributions must be approved by shareholders at the general meeting of shareholders these swiss law requirements relating to our capital management may limit our flexibility and situations may arise where greater flexibility would have provided substantial benefits to our shareholders

 

we have limited capital reserves from which to make distributions or repurchase shares without subjecting our shareholders swiss withholding tax 

 

if we are unable to make distributions if any through a reduction of par value or to pay dividends if any out of qualifying capital contribution reserves then any dividends paid by us will generally be subject to a swiss federal withholding tax at a rate of 35 over the long term the amount of par value and qualifying capital contribution reserves available for us to use for par value reductions or dividends will be limited the withholding tax must be withheld from the gross distribution and paid to the swiss federal tax administration a us holder that qualifies for benefits under the convention between the united states of america and the swiss confederation for the avoidance of double taxation with respect to taxes on income may apply for a refund of the tax withheld in excess of the 15 treaty rate or in excess of the 5 reduced treaty rate for qualifying corporate shareholders with at least 10 participation in our voting stock or for a full refund in case of qualified pension funds however there can be no assurance that our shareholders will approve a reduction in par value or a dividend out of qualifying capital contribution reserves that we will be able to meet the other legal requirements for a reduction in par value or that swiss withholding rules will not be changed in the future or that a change in swiss law will not adversely affect us or our shareholders in particular as a result of distributions out of qualifying capital contribution reserves becoming subject to additional corporate law or other restrictions if we are unable to make a distribution through a reduction in par value or to pay a dividend out of qualifying capital contribution reserves we may not be able to make distributions without subjecting our shareholders to swiss withholding taxes

 



 

 

under current swiss tax law repurchases of shares for the purposes of capital reduction are treated as a partial liquidation subject to 35 swiss withholding tax on the difference between the par value and the repurchase price however the portion of the repurchase price that is attributed to qualifying capital contribution reserves of the shares repurchased will not be subject to the swiss withholding tax therefore repurchase of our own shares further limits the amount of qualifying capital reserves available for distributions to shareholders free of swiss withholding taxes no partial liquidation treatment applies and no withholding tax is triggered if the shares are not repurchased for cancellation but held by us as treasury shares to the extent sufficient qualifying capital reserves are available however should we not resell such treasury shares within six years and there is not sufficient qualifying capital contribution reserves the withholding tax becomes due at the end of the sixyear period 

 

we may follow a share repurchase process for future share repurchases if any similar to a second trading line on the six swiss exchange in which swiss institutional investors buy shares on the open market and sell these shares to us and are generally able to receive a refund of the swiss withholding tax however if we are unable to use this process successfully we may not be able to repurchase shares for the purposes of capital reduction without subjecting our shareholders to swiss withholding taxes if and to the extent that the repurchase of shares is made out of retained earnings or other taxable reserves no withholding tax would be applicable if and to the extent that qualifying capital contribution reserves are attributable to the share repurchase

  

we have certain limitations on our ability to repurchase and hold our own shares 

  

under swiss law we have certain limitations on our ability to repurchase and hold our own shares we and our subsidiaries may only repurchase and hold our own shares to the extent that sufficient freely distributable reserves including contributed surplus as determined for swiss tax and statutory purposes are available the aggregate par value of our registered shares held by us and our subsidiaries may not exceed 10 of our registered share capital we may repurchase our registered shares beyond the statutory limit of 10 however if our shareholders have adopted a resolution at a general meeting of shareholders authorizing the board of directors to repurchase registered shares in an amount in excess of 10 and the repurchased shares are dedicated for cancellation our ability to repurchase and hold our own shares is a significant component of our capital management and shareholder return practices that we believe is important to our shareholders and any restriction on our ability to repurchase our shares could make our stock less attractive to investors

 

as mentioned previously we do not believe that we or any of our united states or nonunited states subsidiaries are currently a controlled foreign corporation cfc for united states federal income tax purposes however the repurchase of the company’s shares reduces the number of shares outstanding which is the basis for determining the ownership percentages for determination of whether the united states shareholders own more than fifty percent of the voting power or value of the company only united states persons that own ten percent or more of the voting power of the company’s shares qualify as united states shareholders we may be limited in the number of shares we repurchase due to united states shareholders holding percentages

overview 

 

we are a leading worldwide provider of navigation communications and information devices most of which are enabled by global positioning system or gps technology we operate in five business segments which serve the marine outdoor fitness auto and aviation markets our segments offer products through our network of subsidiary distributors and independent dealers and distributors however the nature of products and types of customers for the five segments can vary significantly as such the segments are managed separately

 

since our first products were delivered in 1991 we have generated positive income from operations each year and have funded our growth from these profits

 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

 

general 

 

garmin’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon garmin’s consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the presentation of these financial statements requires garmin to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis garmin evaluates its estimates including those related to customer sales programs and incentives product returns bad debts inventories investments intangible assets income taxes warranty obligations and contingencies and litigation garmin bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions

 



 

 

for information on each of the following critical accounting policies andor estimates refer to the discussion in the notes to the consolidated financial statements as indicated in the table below

 

 

 

accounting terms and characteristics 

  

net sales 

 

our net sales are primarily generated through sales to our retail partners dealer and distributor network and to original equipment manufacturers refer to the revenue recognition discussion in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements our sales are largely of a consumer nature and there is a relatively short cycle between order and shipment therefore we believe that backlog levels are not necessarily indicative of our future sales results and backlog information is not material to the understanding of our business we typically ship most orders within 72 hours of receipt

 

net sales are subject to seasonal fluctuation sales of our consumer products are generally higher in the fourth quarter due to increased demand during the holiday buying season and to a lesser extent the second quarter due to increased demand during the spring and summer season sales of consumer products are also influenced by the timing of the release of new products our aviation products do not experience much seasonal variation but are more influenced by the timing of aircraft certifications and the release of new products when the initial demand is typically the strongest

 

cost of salesgross profit 

 

raw material costs are our most significant component of cost of goods sold our existing practice of performing the design and manufacture of our products inhouse has enabled us to source components from different suppliers and where possible to redesign our products to leverage lower cost components we believe that our flexible production model allows our xizhi jhongli and linkou manufacturing plants in taiwan yangzhou manufacturing plant in china and our olathe kansas and salem oregon manufacturing plants in the us to experience relatively low costs of manufacturing in general products manufactured in taiwan have been our highest volume products our manufacturing labor costs historically have been lower in taiwan and china than in olathe and salem

 

sales price variability has had and can be expected to have an effect on our gross profit in the past prices of our devices sold into the auto market have declined due to market pressures and introduction of new products sold at lower price points in recent years pricing has stabilized in auto allowing for relatively stable gross margins excluding the impact of deferred revenues and costs the average selling prices of our aviation outdoor fitness and marine products have historically been stable due to product mix and the introduction of more advanced products sold at higher prices the effect of the sales price differences inherent within the mix of products sold could have a significant impact on our gross profit

    



 

  

advertising expense 

  

our advertising expenses consist of costs for media advertising cooperative advertising with our retail partners point of sale displays and sponsorships

 

selling general and administrative expenses 

 

our selling general and administrative expenses consist primarily of

 

        

research and development 

 

the majority of our research and development costs represent salaries for our engineers costs for high technology components and costs of test equipment used in product and prototype development

 

we are committed to increasing the level of innovative design and development of new products as we strive for expanded ability to serve our existing consumer and aviation markets as well as new markets for active lifestyle products

 

income taxes 

 

we have experienced a relatively low effective corporate tax rate due to the proportion of our revenue generated by entities in tax jurisdictions with low statutory rates in particular the profit entitlement afforded our swissbased companies based on their intellectual property rights ownership of our consumer products have contributed to our relatively low effective corporate tax rate

 

results of operations 

  

the following table sets forth our results of operations as a percentage of net sales during the periods shown the table may not foot due to rounding

 



 

 

  

in 2016 the company moved action camera related revenue and expenses from the outdoor segment to the auto segment allowing for alignment and synergies with other camerabased efforts occurring within the auto segment the overall impact of the move was immaterial however action camera related operating results for the 52weeks ended december 26 2015 and december 27 2014 have been recast to conform to the current year presentation

 

the following table sets forth our results of operations through operating income for each of our five segments during the period shown for each line item in the table the total of the segments’ amounts equals the amount in the consolidated statements of income data included in item 6 

 

  

  

 

 



 

 

comparison of 53weeks ended december 31 2016 and 52weeks ended december 26 2015 

 

net sales 

  

 

 

net sales increased 7 in 2016 when compared to the yearago period all segments had an increase in revenue except for auto auto revenue remains the largest portion of our revenue mix at 29 in the 53weeks ended 2016 compared to 38 in the 52weeks ended 2015

 

total unit sales increased 4 to 168 million units in 2016 from 162 million units in 2015

 

auto segment revenue decreased 17 from the yearago period primarily due to the ongoing pnd market contraction outdoor fitness marine and aviation revenues increased 33 24 16 and 10 respectively when compared to the yearago period primarily due to increases in sales volumes growth in outdoor was driven by wearables and the newly acquired delorme product lines the increase in fitness was driven by wearables with garmin elevate tm wrist heart rate technology our marine segment increased due to growth in chartplotters fishfinders and entertainment systems aviation revenues increased due to growth in both oem and aftermarket sales

 

cost of goods sold 

  

 

 

  

cost of goods sold increased 4 in absolute dollars for the 53weeks ended december 31 2016 when compared to the 52weeks ended december 26 2015

 

in the auto segment the cost of goods decline was largely consistent with the segment revenue decline in the outdoor and fitness segments the increases of 32 and 29 in cost of goods sold respectively primarily reflect strong volume growth in the marine and aviation segments the increases of 16 and 6 respectively primarily reflect volume growth

 



 

  

gross profit 

 

 

 

gross profit dollars in the 53weeks ended december 31 2016 increased 9 while gross profit margin increased 100 basis points compared to the 52weeks ended december 26 2015 growth in sales of higher margin segments contributed to the increase in gross profit dollars and gross margin percentage fitness margin declined to 53 due to product mix all other segment gross margin rates are relatively consistent between fiscal periods

  

advertising expenses 

 

  

advertising expense increased 6 in absolute dollars and was relatively flat as a percent of revenues in the 53weeks ended december 31 2016 compared to the 52weeks ended december 26 2015 the increase in absolute dollars is primarily attributable to outdoor and fitness partially offset by auto

  

selling general and administrative expenses 

 

  

selling general and administrative expense increased 4 and was relatively flat as a percent of revenues in the 53weeks ended december 31 2016 compared to the 52weeks ended december 26 2015 the absolute dollar increase is primarily attributable to information technology costs and salaries and benefits variances by segment are primarily due to the allocation of certain selling general and administrative expenses based on percentage of total revenues with the exception of the marine segment as expenses decreased as a percentage of revenue due to prior year specific litigation matters

 



 

  

research and development expense 

 

  

research and development expense increased 10 due to ongoing development activities for new products and additional engineering personnel throughout the 53weeks ended december 31 2016 in absolute dollars research and development costs increased 409 million when compared with the 52weeks ended december 26 2015 and increased 40 basis points as a percent of revenue our research and development spending is focused on product development improving existing software capabilities and exploring new categories

    

operating income 

 

 

 

as a result of the above operating income increased 14 in absolute dollars and 120 basis points as a percent of revenue when compared to the 52weeks ended december 26 2015 revenue growth with a slight increase in gross margin percentage contributed to the growth slightly offset by increased operating expenses as discussed above with the exception of the marine segment as operating expenses decreased as a percentage of revenue due to prior year specific litigation matters

 

other income expense 

 

  

the average return on cash and investments during the 53weeks ended december 31 2016 and the 52weeks ended december 26 2015 were 15 and 12 respectively interest income increased primarily due to slightly higher yields on fixedincome securities

 

foreign currency gains and losses for the company are typically driven by movements in the taiwan dollar euro and british pound sterling in relation to the us dollar the taiwan dollar is the functional currency of garmin corporation the us dollar is the functional currency of garmin europe ltd and the euro is the functional currency of most of our other european subsidiaries although some transactions and balances are denominated in british pounds the majority of the company’s consolidated foreign currency gain or loss is typically driven by the significant cash and marketable securities receivables and payables held in a currency other than the functional currency at a given legal entity due to the relative size of the entities using a functional currency other than the taiwan dollar euro and british pound sterling currency fluctuations related to these entities are not expected to have a material impact on the company’s financial statements

 



 

 

the 317 million currency loss in fiscal 2016 was primarily due to the weakening of the us dollar against the taiwan dollar and the strengthening of the us dollar against the euro and british pound sterling during fiscal 2016 the us dollar weakened 17 against the taiwan dollar resulting in a loss of 92 million while the us dollar strengthened 42 against the euro and 168 against the british pound sterling resulting in losses of 130 million and 51 million respectively the remaining net currency loss of 44 million is related to other currencies and timing of transactions

 

the 235 million currency loss in fiscal 2015 was primarily due to the strengthening of the us dollar against the euro and british pound sterling partially offset by a gain associated with the strengthening of the us dollar against the taiwan dollar during fiscal 2015 the us dollar strengthened 100 against the euro and 46 against the british pound sterling resulting in losses of 312 million and 21 million respectively this was largely offset by the us dollar strengthening 38 against the taiwan dollar resulting in a gain of 195 million the remaining net currency loss of 97 million is related to other currencies and timing of transactions

 

during the 53weeks ended december 31 2016 garmin recorded other income of 40 million compared to 114 million in the 52weeks ended december 26 2015 the decrease in fiscal 2016 relates primarily to a legal settlement received in fiscal 2015

 

income tax provision 

  

our income tax expense increased by 79 million to 1189 million for the 53weeks ended december 31 2016 from 1110 million for the 52weeks ended december 26 2015 contributing to the increase was

 

  

partially offset by

 

   

as described in note 14 the company expects to revalue certain switzerland deferred tax assets for which the company anticipates recording approximately 150 million of income tax benefit in the first quarter of 2017 this may result in cash outlays for income taxes exceeding income tax expense recognized in certain future periods

  

net income 

 

as a result of the various factors noted above net income increased 12 to 5108 million for the 53weeks ended december 31 2016 compared to 4562 million for the 52weeks ended december 26 2015

 



 

 

comparison of 52weeks ended december 26 2015 and december 27 2014 

 

in 2016 the company moved action camera related revenue and expenses from the outdoor segment to the auto segment allowing for alignment and synergies with other camerabased efforts occurring within the auto segment the overall impact of the move was immaterial however action camera related operating results for the 52weeks ended december 26 2015 and december 27 2014 have been recast to conform to the current year presentation

 

net sales 

  

  

net sales decreased 2 in 2015 when compared to fiscal year 2014 all segments excluding aviation were impacted by revenues denominated in currencies that weakened against the us dollar during the period in total it is estimated that the strong us dollar reduced revenues by approximately 189 million which represents 6 of revenue auto revenue remains the largest portion of our revenue mix at 38 in the fiscal year 2015 compared to 44 in the fiscal year 2014

 

total unit sales increased 7 to 162 million units in 2015 from 151 million units in 2014 the increase in unit sales volume was attributable to fitness and marine volumes partially offset by declines in each of the other segments

 

auto segment revenue decreased 16 from fiscal year 2014 as both the contribution of amortization of previously deferred revenue declined when compared to 2014 and volumes declined fitness revenues increased 16 on the strength of our wearables portfolio aviation revenues increased 3 from fiscal year 2014 as market share gains were partially offset by industry weakness outdoor revenues remained relatively flat to fiscal year 2014 as geographic exposure to weak currencies and maturing product categories were largely offset by the strength of outdoor wearables revenues in our marine segment increased 15 as the release of new marine products drove strong revenue growth

 

cost of goods sold 

  

   

cost of goods sold increased 1 in absolute dollars for fiscal year 2015 when compared to fiscal year 2014 cost of goods as a percentage of revenue increased in part due to a stronger us dollar that created downward pressure on revenue in all segments excluding aviation as discussed above

 

in the auto segment the cost of goods decline was largely consistent with the segment revenue decline in the fitness and outdoor segments the cost of goods increase outpaced revenue growth due to product mix and competitive pricing dynamics the cost of goods decrease as a percentage of revenue in marine is due to increased sales of higher margin products aviation cost of goods was lower due to product mix

 



 

 

gross profit 

 

  

gross profit dollars in fiscal year 2015 decreased 4 while gross profit margin decreased 130 basis points compared to fiscal year 2014 with all segments declining excluding marine and aviation segment specific gross margin drivers are discussed above

 

advertising expenses 

 

  

advertising expense increased 14 in absolute dollars while increasing 80 basis points as a percent of revenues the increase in absolute dollars occurred in fitness and marine to support new product introductions with increased media spend point of sale presence at key retailers and cooperative advertising this was partially offset by decreased spending in auto due to reduced cooperative advertising associated with lower volumes and in outdoor due to fewer new product categories

 

selling general and administrative expenses 

 

  

selling general and administrative expense increased 6 in absolute dollars and 100 basis points as a percent of revenues compared to fiscal year 2014 the absolute dollar increase is primarily related to litigation related costs information technology costs and product support variances by segment are primarily due to the allocation of certain selling general and administrative expenses based on percentage of total revenues marine expense growth exceeded other segments due to specific litigation matters

 



 

 

research and development expense 

 

  

research and development expense increased 8 due to ongoing development activities for new products and additional engineering personnel throughout fiscal year 2015 in absolute dollars research and development costs increased 319 million when compared with fiscal year 2014 and increased 140 basis points as a percent of revenue our research and development spending is focused on product development improving existing software capabilities and exploring new categories management believes that one of the key strategic initiatives for future growth and success of garmin is continuous innovation development and introduction of new products 

  

operating income 

 

   

as a result of the above operating income decreased 20 in absolute dollars and 460 basis points as a percent of revenue when compared to the fiscal year 2014 declining gross margin percentages and increases in all operating expenses as a percentage of revenue as discussed above contributed to the decline

 

other income expense 

 

  



 

 

the average return on cash and investments during the fiscal years of 2015 and 2014 were 12 and 13 respectively the decrease in interest income is attributable to decreasing cash and investment balances and a slight decrease in the interest rates

 

foreign currency gains and losses for the company are primarily tied to movements by the taiwan dollar the euro and the british pound sterling in relation to the us dollar the taiwan dollar is the functional currency of garmin corporation the us dollar remains the functional currency of garmin europe ltd the euro is the functional currency of most european subsidiaries as these entities have grown currency fluctuations can generate material gains and losses the majority of the company’s consolidated foreign currency gain or loss results from the significant cash and marketable securities receivables and payables held in a currency other than the functional currency at one of the company’s subsidiaries due to the relative size of the entities using a functional currency other than the taiwan dollar the euro and the british pound sterling currency fluctuations related to these entities are not expected to have a material impact on the company’s financial statements

 

the 235 million currency loss in fiscal 2015 was primarily due to the strengthening of the us dollar against the euro and british pound sterling partially offset by a gain associated with the strengthening of the us dollar against the taiwan dollar during fiscal 2015 the us dollar strengthened 100 against the euro and 46 against the british pound sterling resulting in losses of 312 million and 21 million respectively this was largely offset by the us dollar strengthening 38 against the taiwan dollar resulting in a gain of 195 million the remaining net currency loss of 97 million is related to other currencies and timing of transactions

 

the majority of the 43 million currency loss in the fiscal year 2014 was due to the strengthening of the us dollar compared to the euro and the british pound sterling the strengthening of the us dollar compared to the taiwan dollar contributed an offsetting gain during fiscal year 2014 the us dollar strengthened 114 compared to the euro and 55 compared to the british pound sterling resulting in a net loss of 437 million this was more than offset as the us dollar strengthened 55 compared to the taiwan dollar resulting in a gain of 448 million the remaining net currency loss of 54 million is related to other currencies and timing of transactions

 

during fiscal year 2015 garmin recorded other income of 114 million this income was primarily due to a legal settlement received during the year and a gain on the disposal of property

 

income tax provision 

  

our income tax expense decreased by 2486 million to 1110 million for the fiscal year 2015 from 3595 million for the fiscal year 2014 contributing to the significant decrease was

 

  

partially offset by

 

  

in addition the full year income mix by tax jurisdiction for 2015 compared to 2014 is resulting in an increased effective tax rate

 

in the third quarter of 2014 the company initiated an intercompany restructuring that realigned our corporate entity structure this change in corporate structure provides access to historical earnings that were previously permanently reinvested and allows us to efficiently repatriate future earnings as a result of the change in corporate structure garmin recorded tax expense of 3076 million   the cash tax payments of 781 million and 1828 million associated with the restructuring were made in the third quarter of 2014 and the second quarter of 2015 respectively the remainder of the accrued tax will be paid incrementally as the cash is repatriated 

 



 

 

net income 

 

as a result of the various factors noted above net income increased 25 to 4562 million for the fiscal year 2015 compared to 3642 million for the fiscal year 2014

 

liquidity and capital resources 

 

operating activities 

 

  

the 4252 million increase in cash provided by operating activities in fiscal year 2016 compared to fiscal year 2015 was primarily due to the following

 

        

partially offset by

 

    



 

 

the 2422 million decrease in cash provided by operating activities in fiscal year 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014 was primarily due to the following

 

     

partially offset by

 

      

investing activities 

 

  

the 96 million increase in cash used in investing activities in fiscal year 2016 compared to fiscal year 2015 was primarily due to the following

 

    

partially offset by

 

  

the 2433 million decrease in cash provided by investing activities in fiscal year 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014 was primarily due to the following

 

    



 

 

we have budgeted approximately 130 million to 140 million of capital expenditures during fiscal 2017 to include some facility expansion along with normal ongoing capital expenditures and maintenance activities approximately half of the budgeted capital expenditures in fiscal 2017 are attributable to olathe kansas facilities including the expansion project described within “item 2 properties” it is management’s goal to invest the onhand cash in accordance with the investment policy which has been approved by the board of directors of each applicable garmin entity holding the cash the investment policy’s primary purpose is to preserve capital maintain an acceptable degree of liquidity and maximize yield within the constraint of low credit risk garmin’s average returns on cash and investments during fiscal 2016 2015 and 2014 were approximately 15 12 and 13 respectively

 

the company’s investment policy targets low risk investments with the objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss the fair value of our securities varies from period to period due to changes in interest rates in the performance of the underlying collateral and in the credit performance of the underlying issuer among other factors see note 3 for additional information regarding marketable securities

  

financing activities 

 

  

the 616 million increase in cash used in financing activities in fiscal year 2016 compared to fiscal year 2015 was primarily due to the following

 

  

partially offset by

 

  

the 995 million decrease in cash used in financing activities in fiscal year 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014 was primarily due to the following

 

  

partially offset by

 

  

our dividend has progressively increased from 045 per share for the eight calendar quarters beginning in june 2012 to 048 per share for the four calendar quarters beginning in june 2014 to 051 per share for the eight calendar quarters beginning in june 2015

 

we primarily use cash flow from operations to fund our capital expenditures to support our working capital requirements to pay dividends and to fund share repurchases we expect that future cash requirements will principally be for capital expenditures working capital payment of dividends declared share repurchases and the funding of strategic acquisitions we believe that our existing cash balances and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our longterm projected capital expenditures working capital and other cash requirements

 



 

  

contractual obligations and commercial commitments 

 

as of december 31 2016 operating leases comprise the substance of the company’s commercial commitments with longterm scheduled payments as summarized below

 

  

the company is party to certain other commitments which include purchases of raw materials advertising expenditures investments in certain low income housing tax credit projects and other indirect purchases in connection with conducting our business the aggregate amount of purchase orders and other commitments open as of december 31 2016 was approximately 4031 million we cannot determine the aggregate amount of such purchase orders that represent contractual obligations because purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements our purchase orders are based on our current needs and are typically fulfilled within short periods of time

 

we may be required to make significant cash outlays related to unrecognized tax benefits however due to the uncertainty of the timing of future cash flows associated with our unrecognized tax benefits we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement if any with the respective taxing authorities accordingly unrecognized tax benefits of 1151 million as of december 31 2016 have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above for further information related to unrecognized tax benefits see note 2 “income taxes” to the consolidated financial statements included in this report

  

offbalance sheet arrangements 

 

we do not have any offbalance sheet arrangements

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

 

market sensitivity 

 

we have market risk primarily in connection with the pricing of our products and services and the purchase of raw materials product pricing and raw materials costs are both significantly influenced by semiconductor market conditions historically during cyclical industry downturns we have been able to offset pricing declines for our products through a combination of improved product mix and success in obtaining price reductions in raw materials costs

  

inflation 

 

we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our business financial condition or results of operations if our costs were to become subject to significant inflationary pressures we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs through price increases our inability or failure to do so could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations

 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

 

the operation of garmin’s subsidiaries in international markets results in exposure to movements in currency exchange rates we have experienced significant foreign currency gains and losses due to the strengthening and weakening of the us dollar the potential of volatile foreign exchange rate fluctuations in the future could have a significant effect on our results of operations the company has not historically hedged its foreign currency exchange rate risks

 



 

 

the currencies that create a majority of the company’s exchange rate exposure are the taiwan dollar euro and british pound sterling garmin corporation headquartered in xizhi taiwan uses the local currency as the functional currency the company translates all assets and liabilities at yearend exchange rates and income and expense accounts at average rates during the year in order to minimize the effect of the currency exchange fluctuations on our net assets we have elected to retain most of our taiwan subsidiary’s cash and investments in marketable securities denominated in us dollars

 

most european subsidiaries use the euro as the functional currency the functional currency of our largest european subsidiary garmin europe ltd remains the us dollar and as some transactions occurred in british pounds sterling or euros foreign currency gains or losses have been realized historically related to the movements of those currencies relative to the us dollar the company believes that gains and losses will become more material in the future as our european presence grows

 

during fiscal year 2016 the us dollar weakened 17 against the taiwan dollar resulting in a 92 million foreign currency loss the us dollar strengthened 42 against the euro resulting in a foreign currency loss of 130 million the us dollar strengthened 168 against the british pound sterling resulting in a loss of 51 million the net result of these currency moves combined with other net losses of 44 million and the timing of transactions during the year was a net loss of 317 million for the company and a currency translation adjustment of 47 million during the fiscal year 2016

 

we assessed the company’s exposure to movements in currency exchange rates by performing a sensitivity analysis of adverse changes in exchange rates and the corresponding impact to our results of operations based on monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than respective functional currencies as of december 31 2016 and december 26 2015 hypothetical and reasonably possible adverse changes of 10 for the taiwan dollar euro and british pound sterling would have resulted in an adverse impact on income before income taxes of approximately 92 million and 95 million at december 31 2016 and december 26 2015

  

interest rate risk 

 

we have no outstanding longterm debt as of december 31 2016 we therefore have no meaningful debtrelated interest rate risk

 

we are exposed to interest rate risk in connection with our investments in marketable securities as interest rates change the unrealized gains and losses associated with those securities will fluctuate accordingly

the company’s investment policy targets low risk investments with the objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss the company does not intend to sell securities in an unrealized loss position and it is not more likely than not that the company will be required to sell such investments before recovery of their amortized costs bases which may be maturity during 2016 and 2015 the company did not record any material impairment charges on its outstanding securities

 

we assessed the company’s exposure to interest rate risk by performing a sensitivity analysis of a parallel shift in the yield curve and the corresponding impact to the company’s portfolio of marketable securities based on balance sheet positions as of december 31 2016 and december 26 2015 the hypothetical and reasonably possible 100 basis point increases in interest rates across all securities would have resulted in declines in portfolio fair market value of approximately 45 million and 43 million at december 31 2016 and december 26 2015 such losses would only be realized if the company sold the investments prior to maturity

garmin believes that its principal competitors for portable automotive products are tomtom nv and mitac digital corporation mitac which distributes products under the brand names of magellan mio and navman garmin believes that its principal competitors for infotainment solutions are harman international industries panasonic corporation and the mitsubishi group garmin believes that its principal competitors for outdoor product lines are bushnell delorme magellan a subsidiary of mitac sportdog brand and suunto oy for mobile products garmin believes that its principal competitors are google inc apple inc and telenav inc garmin believes that its principal competitors for fitness products are apple inc bryton corp fitbit inc aliphcom dba jawbone polar electro oy sigma sports suunto oy and timex corp for marine products garmin believes that its principal competitors are furuno electronic company the humminbird division of johnson outdoors inc navico and flir systems inc for garmin’s aviation product lines garmin considers its principal competitors to be aspen avionics avidyne corporation chelton flight systems cmc electronics free flight systems genesys aerosystems honeywell inc innovative solutions and support inc l3 avionics systems rockwell collins inc sagem sa and universal avionics systems corporation

 

research and development 

 

garmin’s product innovations are driven by its strong emphasis on research and development and the close partnership between garmin’s engineering and manufacturing teams garmin’s products are created by its engineering and development staff which numbered 3412 people worldwide as of december 26 2015 garmin’s manufacturing staff includes manufacturing process engineers who work closely with garmin’s design engineers to ensure manufacturability and manufacturing cost control for its products garmin’s development staff includes industrial designers as well as software engineers electrical engineers mechanical engineers and cartographic engineers garmin believes the industrial design of its products has played an important role in garmin’s success once a development project is initiated and approved a multidisciplinary team is created to design the product and transition it into manufacturing

 

below is a table of garmin’s expenditures on research and development over the last three fiscal years 

  

   

manufacturing and operations 

 

garmin believes one of its core competencies and strengths is its vertically integrated manufacturing capabilities at its taiwan facilities in xizhi jhongli and linkou its china facility in yangzhou and at its us facilities in olathe kansas and salem oregon garmin believes that its ownership and operation of its own manufacturing facilities and distribution networks provides significant capability and flexibility to address the breadth and depth of resources necessary to serve its diverse products and markets

 

specifically garmin believes that its vertical integration of its manufacturing capabilities provides advantages to product cost quality and time to market

 



 

  

cost garmin’s manufacturing resources rapidly and iteratively prototype designs concepts products and processes achieving higher efficiency resulting in lower cost garmin’s vertical integration approach enables leveraging our manufacturing resources across high mid and low volume products sharing of these resources across our product lines favorably affects garmin’s costs to produce its range of products with lower volume products realizing the economies of scale of the high volume products the ownership and integration of our resources allows garmin to optimize the design for manufacturing of our products yielding improved cost

 

quality garmin’s automation and sophisticated production processes provide inservice robustness and consistent reliability standards that enables garmin to maintain strict process and quality control of the products manufactured thereby improving the overall quality of our products additionally the immediate feedback throughout the manufacturing processes is provided to the development teams providing integrated continuous improvement throughout design and supply chain

 

time to market garmin uses multidisciplinary teams of design engineers process engineers and supply chain specialists to develop products allowing them to quickly move from concept to manufacturing this integrated ownership provides inherent flexibility to enable faster time to market

 

garmin’s design manufacturing distribution and servicing processes in its us taiwan china and uk facilities are certified to iso 9001 an international quality standard developed by the international organization for standardization garmin’s automotive operations in taiwan and olathe have achieved ts 16949 certification a quality standard for automotive suppliers garmin’s new china facility in yangzhou has received a ts16949 letter of conformance and expects to be formally certified in fourth quarter 2016 garmin’s olathe and salem aviation operations have achieved certification to as9100 the quality standard for the aviation industry 

 

garmin international inc garmin europe ltd and garmin corporation have also achieved certification of their environmental management systems to the iso 14001 standard recognizing garmin’s systems and processes which minimize or prevent harmful effects on the environment and continually strive to improve its environmental performance

 

materials 

  

although most components essential to garmin’s business are generally available from multiple sources certain key components are currently obtained by the company from single or limited sources which subjects garmin to supply and pricing risks many of these and other key components that are available from multiple sources including but not limited to nand flash memory dynamic random access memory dram gps chipsets and certain lcds are subject at times to industrywide shortages and commodity pricing fluctuations

 

garmin and other participants in the personal computer tablet mobile communication aviation electronics and consumer electronics industries also compete for various components with other industries that have experienced increased demand for their products in addition garmin uses some custom components that are not common to the rest of the personal computer tablet mobile communication and consumer electronics industries and new products introduced by the company often utilize custom components available from only one source until garmin has evaluated whether there is a need for and subsequently qualifies additional suppliers when a component or product uses new technologies initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields have matured or manufacturing capacity has increased garmin makes efforts to manage risks in these areas through the use of supply agreements for strategically important components nevertheless if garmin’s supply of a key singlesourced component for a new or existing product was delayed or constrained if such components were available only at significantly higher prices or if a key manufacturing vendor delayed shipments of completed products to garmin garmin’s financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected garmin’s business and financial performance could also be adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the original source or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source continued availability of these components at acceptable prices or at all may be affected if those suppliers decided to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet garmin’s requirements

  



 

  

seasonality 

  

our sales are subject to seasonal fluctuation sales of our consumer products are generally higher in the fourth quarter due to increased demand during the holiday buying season and to a lesser extent the second quarter due to increased demand during the spring and summer season and the mother’s dayfather’s daygraduation buying season sales of consumer products are also influenced by the timing of the release of new products our aviation products do not experience much seasonal variation but are more influenced by the timing of the release of new products when the initial demand is typically the strongest

  

backlog 

 

our sales are generally of a consumer nature and there is a relatively short cycle between order and shipment therefore we believe that backlog information is not material to the understanding of our business we typically ship most orders within 72 hours of receipt

  

intellectual property 

  

our success and ability to compete is dependent in part on our proprietary technology we rely on a combination of patent copyright trademark and trade secret laws as well as confidentiality agreements to establish and protect our proprietary rights in addition garmin often relies on licenses of intellectual property for use in its business for example garmin obtains licenses for digital cartography technology for use in our products from various sources

 

as of january 7 2016 garmin’s worldwide ip portfolio includes over 950 patent and 640 trademark registrations issued worldwide generally patents issued in the united states are effective for 20 years from the earliest asserted filing date of the patent application the duration of foreign patents varies in accordance with the provisions of applicable local law for the past eight years garmin has been selected as a constituent of the ocean tomo® 300 patent index which recognizes companies with high intellectual property value we believe that our continued success depends on the intellectual skills of our employees and their ability to continue to innovate garmin will continue to file and prosecute patent applications when appropriate to attempt to protect garmin’s rights in its proprietary technologies

 

there is no assurance that our current patents or patents which we may later acquire may successfully withstand any challenge in whole or in part it is also possible that any patent issued to us may not provide us with any competitive advantages or that the patents of others will preclude us from manufacturing and marketing certain products despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights to protect our trade secrets to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others or to defend against claims of infringement or invalidity

  

regulations 

  

the telecommunications industry is highly regulated and the regulatory environment in which garmin operates is subject to change in accordance with the united states’ federal communications commission fcc rules and regulations wireless transceiver products are required to be certified by the fcc and comparable authorities in foreign countries where they are sold garmin’s products sold in europe are required to comply with relevant directives of the european commission a delay in receiving required certifications for new products or enhancements to garmin’s products or losing certification for garmin’s existing products could adversely affect our business in addition aviation products that are intended for installation in “type certificated aircraft” are required to be certified by the faa its european counterpart the european aviation safety agency and other comparable organizations before they can be used in an aircraft

 



 

 

because garmin corporation one of the company’s principal subsidiaries is located in taiwan foreign exchange control laws and regulations of taiwan with respect to remittances into and out of taiwan may have an impact on garmin’s operations the taiwan foreign exchange control statute and regulations thereunder provides that all foreign exchange transactions must be executed by banks designated to handle such business by the ministry of finance of taiwan and by the central bank of the republic of china taiwan also referred to as the cbc current regulations favor traderelated foreign exchange transactions consequently foreign currency earned from exports of merchandise and services may now be retained and used freely by exporters while all foreign currency needed for the import of merchandise and services may be purchased freely from the designated foreign exchange banks aside from traderelated foreign exchange transactions taiwan companies and residents may without foreign exchange approval remit outside and into taiwan foreign currencies of up to 50 million and 5 million respectively or their equivalent each calendar year currency conversions within the limits are processed by the designated banks and do not have to be reviewed and approved by the cbc the above limits apply to remittances involving a conversion between new taiwan dollars and us dollars or other foreign currencies the cbc typically approves foreign exchange in excess of the limits if a party applies with the cbc for review and presents legitimate business reasons justifying the currency conversion a requirement is also imposed on all enterprises to register all medium and longterm foreign debt with the cbc

 

environmental matters 

 

garmin’s operations are subject to various environmental laws including laws addressing air and water pollution and management of hazardous substances and wastes substantial noncompliance with applicable environmental laws could have a material adverse effect on our business capital expenditures for environmental controls are included in our normal capital budget

 

environmental regulation of garmin’s products is increasing many of garmins products are subject to laws relating to the chemical and material composition of our products and their energy efficiency garmin is also subject to laws requiring manufacturers to be financially responsible for collection recovery and recycling of wastes from certain electronic products compliance with current environmental laws does not have a material impact on our business but the impact of future enactment of environmental laws cannot yet be fully determined and could be substantial

 

garmin has implemented multiple environmental management system ems policies in accordance with the international organization for standardization iso 14001 standard for environmental health and safety management garmin’s ems policies set forth practices standards and procedures to ensure compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations at garmin’s kansas headquarters facility garmin’s european headquarters facility and garmin’s taiwan manufacturing facility

 

regulatory and “green procurement” demands from our customers are also increasing particularly in the areas of restricted substance use and environmentallyfriendly design and manufacture initiatives the overall impacts of these customer requirements cannot yet be established garmin is committed to improving our products and processes to meet our customer needs

 

employees 

  

as of december 26 2015 garmin had 11651 full and parttime employees worldwide of whom 4333 were in the united states 88 were in canada 5289 were in taiwan 1294 were in europe and 647 were in other global locations except for some of garmin’s employees in brazil and sweden none of garmin’s employees are represented by a labor union and none of garmins north american or taiwan employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement garmin considers its employee relations to be good

 



 

  




 item 1a risk factors 

  

the risks described below are not the only ones facing our company additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also impair our business operations if any of the following risks occur our business financial condition or operating results could be materially adversely affected 

  

risks related to the company 

  

if we are not successful in the continued development introduction or timely manufacture of new products demand for our products could decrease 

  

we expect that a significant portion of our future revenue will continue to be derived from sales of newly introduced products the market for our products is characterized by rapidly changing technology evolving industry standards and changes in customer needs if we fail to introduce new products or to modify or improve our existing products in response to changes in technology industry standards or customer needs our products could rapidly become less competitive or obsolete we must continue to make significant investments in research and development in order to continue to develop new products enhance existing products and achieve market acceptance for such products however there can be no assurance that development stage products will be successfully completed or if developed will achieve significant customer acceptance

 

if we are unable to successfully develop and introduce competitive new products and enhance our existing products our future results of operations would be adversely affected our pursuit of necessary technology may require substantial time and expense we may need to license new technologies to respond to technological change these licenses may not be available to us on terms that we can accept or may materially change the gross profits that we are able to obtain on our products we may not succeed in adapting our products to new technologies as they emerge development and manufacturing schedules for technology products are difficult to predict and there can be no assurance that we will achieve timely initial customer shipments of new products the timely availability of these products in volume and their acceptance by customers are important to our future success any future challenges related to new products whether due to product development delays manufacturing delays lack of market acceptance delays in regulatory approval or otherwise could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations

  

if we are unable to compete effectively with existing or new competitors our resulting loss of competitive position could result in price reductions fewer customer orders reduced margins and loss of market share 

  

the markets for many of our products are highly competitive and we expect competition to increase in the future some of our competitors have significantly greater financial technical and marketing resources than we do these competitors may be able to respond more rapidly to new or emerging technologies or changes in customer requirements they may also be able to devote greater resources to the development promotion and sale of their products or secure better product positioning with retailers increased competition could result in price reductions fewer customer orders reduced margins and loss of market share our failure to compete successfully against current or future competitors could seriously harm our business financial condition and results of operations

  

the demand for personal navigation devices pnds has been and continues to be reduced by replacement technologies becoming available on mobile devices and factoryinstalled systems in new autos as well as by market saturation 

  

gpsnavigation technologies have been incorporated into competing devices such as mobile handsets tablets and new automobiles through factoryinstalled systems many companies are now offering navigation software for these mobile devices the acceptance of this technology by consumers has reduced sales in this segment and has reduced margins in some periods navigation systems are also becoming more prevalent as standard andor optional equipment on new automobiles increased navigation penetration on mobile handsets and in new automobiles is expected to cause further declines in sales of our portable navigation devices and could further reduce margins

 

our annual and quarterly financial statements will reflect fluctuations in foreign currency translation 

 

the operation of garmin’s subsidiaries in international markets results in exposure to movements in currency exchange rates we have experienced significant foreign currency gains and losses due to the strengthening and weakening of the us dollar the potential of volatile foreign exchange rate fluctuations in the future could have a significant effect on our results of operations the company has not historically hedged its foreign currency exchange rate risks

 



 

  

the currencies that create a majority of the company’s exchange rate exposure are the taiwan dollar euro and british pound sterling the taiwan dollar is the functional currency of garmin corporation the us dollar remains the functional currency of garmin europe the euro is the functional currency of most european subsidiaries as these entities have grown currency moves can generate material gains and losses additionally euro denominated intercompany transactions in garmin ltd can also generate currency gains and losses other legal entities primarily use the local currency as the functional currency due to the relative size of entities using a functional currency other than the taiwan dollar the euro and the british pound sterling currency fluctuations within these entities are not expected to have a material impact on the company’s financial statements

 

the company translates all assets and liabilities at yearend exchange rates and income and expense accounts at average rates during the year us gaap requires the company at the end of each accounting period to translate into functional currency all us dollar denominated assets and liabilities this us gaapmandated translation will cause us to recognize gain or loss on our financial statements as the us dollar strengthens or weakens against the various functional currencies such gain or loss will create variations in our earnings per share because there is minimal cash impact caused by such exchange rate variations management will continue to focus on the company’s operating performance before the impact of the foreign currency translation 

 

the auto segment which represents approximately 37 of our revenues is expected to continue to decline in 2016 

  

we experienced substantial growth through 2008 in the auto segment of our business as the products became massmarket consumer electronics in both europe and north america this market is declining as competing technologies emerged and market saturation occurred this has resulted in and could continue to result in periods of lower revenues for this segment and lower earnings per share

  

economic conditions and uncertainty could adversely affect our revenue and margins 

  

our revenue and margins depend significantly on general economic conditions and the demand for products in the markets in which we compete economic weakness or constrained consumer and business spending has resulted in periods of decreased revenue and in the future could result in decreased revenue and problems with our ability to manage inventory levels and collect customer receivables in addition financial difficulties experienced by our retailers and oem customers have resulted and could result in the future in significant bad debt writeoffs and additions to reserves in our receivables and could have an adverse effect on our results of operations

  

if we do not correctly anticipate demand for our products we may not be able to secure sufficient quantities or costeffective production of our products or we could have costly excess production or inventories 

  

we have generally been able to increase or decrease production to meet fluctuations in demand however the demand for our products depends on many factors and may be difficult to forecast we expect that it will become more difficult to forecast demand as we introduce and support a diverse product portfolio as competition in the market for our products intensifies and as the markets for some of our products mature significant unanticipated fluctuations in demand could cause the following problems in our operations

 

  

  

 

 



 

  

we depend on our suppliers some of which are the sole source for specific components and our production would be seriously harmed if these suppliers are not able to meet our demand and alternative sources are not available or if the costs of components rise 

  

we are dependent on third party suppliers for various components used in our current products some of the components that we procure from third party suppliers include semiconductors and electroluminescent panels liquid crystal displays memory chips batteries and microprocessors the cost quality and availability of components are essential to the successful production and sale of our products some components we use are from sole source suppliers certain applicationspecific integrated circuits incorporating our proprietary designs are manufactured for us by sole source suppliers alternative sources may not be currently available for these sole source components

 

in the past we have experienced shortages of certain components in addition if there are shortages in supply of components the costs of such components may rise if suppliers are unable to meet our demand for components on a timely basis and if we are unable to obtain an alternative source or if the price of the alternative source is prohibitive or if the costs of components rise our ability to maintain timely and costeffective production of our products would be seriously harmed

  

gross margins for our products may fluctuate or erode 

  

gross margins in some of our segments have declined in recent years and could further decline in the future due to competitive price reductions that are not fully offset by material cost reductions in addition our overall gross margin may fluctuate from period to period due to a number of factors including product mix competition and unit volumes in particular the average selling prices of a specific product tend to decrease over that product’s life to offset such decreases we intend to rely primarily on component cost reduction obtaining yield improvements and corresponding cost reductions in the manufacturing of existing products and on introducing new products that incorporate advanced features and therefore can be sold at higher average selling prices however there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain any such yield improvements or cost reductions or introduce any such new products in the future to the extent that such cost reductions and new product introductions do not occur in a timely manner or our products do not achieve market acceptance our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected

 



 

 

changes in our united states federal income tax classification or in applicable tax laws could result in adverse tax consequences to our shareholders 

 

legislative proposals have been considered in the united states within the past few years that could increase the united states tax burden of corporations with international operations and could broaden the circumstances under which foreign corporations could be considered resident in the united states legislative proposals are being considered in switzerland that could make significant changes in the corporate tax regime and increase the taxes applicable to us in switzerland our tax position could be adversely impacted by changes in swiss united states or foreign tax laws tax treaties or tax regulations or the interpretation or enforcement thereof by any tax authority we cannot predict the outcome of any specific legislative proposals

 

recently the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd issued final recommendations to prevent perceived base erosion and profit shifting by multinational corporations while these recommendations are not changes to tax law the countries where we operate may implement legislation or take unilateral actions which may result in adverse effects to our income tax provision and financial statements

 

we do not believe that we or any of our united states or nonunited states subsidiaries are currently a ‘‘passive foreign investment company’’ for united states federal income tax purposes we do not expect to become a passive foreign investment company however because the passive foreign investment company determination is made annually based on whether the company’s income or assets meet certain thresholds as determined under united states federal tax principles which are based on facts and circumstances that may be beyond our control we cannot assure that we will not become a passive foreign investment company in the future if we are a passive foreign investment company in any year then any of our shareholders that is a united states person could be liable to pay tax on their pro rata share of our income plus an interest charge upon some distributions by us or when that shareholder sells our common shares at a gain further if we are classified as a passive foreign investment company in any year in which a united states person is a shareholder we generally will continue to be treated as a passive foreign investment company with respect to such shareholder in all succeeding years regardless of whether we continue to satisfy the income or asset tests mentioned above

 

we do not believe that we or any of our united states or nonunited states subsidiaries are currently a controlled foreign corporation cfc for united states federal income tax purposes we do not expect to become a cfc the cfc determination is made daily based on whether the united states shareholders own more than fifty percent of the voting power or value of the company only united states persons that own ten percent or more of the voting power of the company’s shares qualify as united states shareholders currently the company has two shareholders that qualify as united states shareholders owning greater than ten percent of the voting power totaling 35 of the outstanding shares thus the addition of even one additional ten percent or greater united states shareholder could result in classification as a cfc and subject all such holders to significant tax consequences if the company were to be classified as a cfc for an uninterrupted thirty day period in any year the company’s shareholders that qualify as united states shareholders could be liable to pay us income tax at ordinary income tax rates on their prorata share of certain categories of the company’s income for the period in which the company is classified as a cfc as the company cannot control the ownership of the company’s stock nor can the company control which shareholders participate in the company’s stock buyback program ownership changes could result that create united states shareholders which increase the risk of garmin being treated as a cfc 

 

we have benefited in the past from taiwan government tax incentives offered on certain high technology capital investments that may not always be available 

  

our effective tax rate has historically been lower than the us federal statutory rate in part because we have benefited from incentives offered in taiwan related to our high technology investments in taiwan the loss of these tax benefits has begun to have a negative impact on our effective tax rate and reduced benefits will continue into the future 

 



 

  

we may experience unique economic and political risks associated with companies that operate in taiwan 

  

relations between taiwan and the people’s republic of china also referred to as the prc and other factors affecting the political or economic conditions of taiwan in the future could materially affect our business financial condition and results of operations and the market price and the liquidity of our shares our principal manufacturing facilities where we manufacture all of our products except our panelmounted aviation products are located in taiwan

 

taiwan has a unique international political status the prc asserts sovereignty over all of china including taiwan certain other islands and all of mainland china the prc government does not recognize the legitimacy of the taiwan government although significant economic and cultural relations have been established during recent years between taiwan and the prc the prc government has indicated that it may use military force to gain control over taiwan in certain circumstances such as the declaration of independence by taiwan relations between taiwan and the prc have on occasion adversely affected the market value of taiwanese companies and could negatively affect our operations in taiwan in the future

 

our intellectual property rights are important to our operations and we could suffer loss if they infringe upon other’s rights or are infringed upon by others 

  

we rely on a combination of patents copyrights trademarks and trade secrets confidentiality provisions and licensing arrangements to establish and protect our proprietary rights to this end we hold rights to a number of patents and registered trademarks and regularly file applications to attempt to protect our rights in new technology and trademarks however there is no guarantee that our patent applications will become issued patents or that our trademark applications will become registered trademarks moreover even if approved our patents or trademarks may thereafter be successfully challenged by others or otherwise become invalidated for a variety of reasons thus any patents or trademarks we currently have or may later acquire may not provide us a significant competitive advantage

 

third parties may claim that we are infringing their intellectual property rights such claims could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition from time to time we receive letters alleging infringement of patents trademarks or other intellectual property rights and we have been and currently are a defendant in lawsuits alleging patent infringement litigation concerning patents or other intellectual property is costly and time consuming we may seek licenses from such parties but they could refuse to grant us a license or demand commercially unreasonable terms such infringement claims could also cause us to incur substantial liabilities and to suspend or permanently cease the use of critical technologies or processes or the production or sale of major products

 

we may become subject to significant product liability costs 

  

if our aviation products malfunction or contain errors or defects airplane collisions or crashes could occur resulting in property damage personal injury or death malfunctions or errors or defects in our marine navigational products could cause boats to run aground or cause other wreckage personal injury or death if our automotive or marine products contain defects or errors in the mapping supplied by thirdparty map providers or if our users do not heed our warnings about the proper use of these products collisions or accidents could occur resulting in property damage personal injury or death if any of these events occurs we could be subject to significant liability for personal injury and property damage and under certain circumstances could be subject to a judgment for punitive damages we maintain insurance against accidentrelated risks involving our products however there can be no assurance that such insurance would be sufficient to cover the cost of damages to others or that such insurance will continue to be available at commercially reasonable rates in addition insurance coverage may not cover awards of punitive damages and may not cover the cost of associated legal fees and defense costs which could result in lower margins if we are unable to maintain sufficient insurance to cover product liability costs or if our insurance coverage does not cover the award this could have a materially adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations

  



 

  

we have claims and lawsuits against us that may result in adverse outcomes 

 

we are subject to a variety of claims and lawsuits adverse outcomes in some or all of these claims may result in significant monetary damages or injunctive relief that could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business litigation and other claims are subject to inherent uncertainties and the outcomes can be difficult to predict management may not adequately reserve for a contingent liability or we may suffer unforeseen liabilities which could then impact the results of a financial period a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements could occur for the period in which the effect of an unfavorable final outcome becomes probable and reasonably estimable which if not expected could harm our results of operations and financial condition

 

we collect store process and use personal information and other customer data which subjects us to governmental regulation and other legal obligations related to privacy information security and data protection and our actual or perceived failure to comply with such obligations could harm our business 

 

we collect store process and use personal information and other user data our users’ fitnessrelated data and personal information may include among other information names addresses phone numbers email addresses payment account information height weight age heart rates sleeping patterns gpsbased location and activity patterns due to the volume and types of the personal information and data we manage and the nature of our products the security features of our platform and information systems are critical if our security measures and applications are breached or fail unauthorized persons may be able to obtain access to user data if we or our thirdparty service providers business partners or thirdparty apps with which our users choose to share their garmin data were to experience a breach of systems compromising our users’ data or the media suggested that our security measures were insufficient our brand and reputation could be adversely affected use of our products and services could decrease and we could be exposed to a risk of loss litigation and regulatory proceedings depending on the nature of the information compromised in the event of a data breach or other unauthorized access to our user data we may also have obligations to notify users about the incident and we may need to provide some form of remedy for the individuals affected by the incident a growing number of legislative and regulatory bodies have adopted consumer notification requirements in the event of unauthorized access to or acquisition of certain types of personal data such breach notification laws continue to evolve and may be inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another complying with these obligations could cause us to incur substantial costs and could increase negative publicity surrounding any incident that compromises user data our users may also accidentally disclose or lose control of their passwords creating the perception that our systems are not secure against thirdparty access additionally if third parties we work with such as vendors business partners service providers or developers violate applicable laws agreements or our policies such violations may also put our users’ information at risk and could in turn have an adverse effect on our business while we maintain insurance coverage that subject to policy terms and conditions and a significant selfinsured retention is designed to address certain aspects of cyber risks such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise in the continually evolving area of cyber risk

  

regulatory authorities around the world are considering a number of legislative and regulatory proposals concerning data protection in addition the interpretation and application of consumer and data protection laws in the us europe and elsewhere are often uncertain and in flux it is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our data practices if so in addition to the possibility of fines this could result in an order requiring that we change our data practices which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations complying with these various laws could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business

 

security breaches and other disruptions including as a result of cyber attacks may harm our reputation and adversely affect our business and results of operations 

 

in the ordinary course of our business we electronically maintain sensitive data including intellectual property our proprietary business information and that of our customers and suppliers and some personally identifiable information of our customers and employees in our facilities and on our networks the secure processing maintenance and transmission of this information is important to our operations a breach of our security systems and procedures or those of our vendors could result in significant data losses or theft of our customers or our employees intellectual property proprietary business information or personally identifiable information a cybersecurity breach could negatively affect our reputation as a trusted product and service provider by adversely affecting the markets perception of the security or reliability of our products or services 

 

we have technology and processes in place to detect and respond to data security incidents however because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access disable or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently and may be difficult to detect for long periods of time we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventive measures in addition hardware software or applications we develop or procure from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture or other problems that could unexpectedly compromise information security unauthorized parties may also attempt to gain access to our systems or facilities through fraud trickery or other forms of deceiving our customers and employees accordingly we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate security barriers or other preventative measures or if such measures are implemented and even with appropriate training conducted in support of such measures human errors may still occur it is virtually impossible for us to entirely mitigate this risk a party whether internal or external who is able to circumvent our security measures could misappropriate information

 



 

 

actual or anticipated attacks and risks may cause us to incur increasing costs including costs to deploy additional personnel and protection technologies to train employees and to engage third party security experts and consultants our technology errors and omissions insurance may not protect against all of the costs liabilities and other adverse effects arising from a security breach or system failure if we fail to reasonably maintain the security of confidential information we may suffer significant reputational and financial losses and our results of operations cash flows financial condition and liquidity may be adversely affected in addition a system breach could result in other negative consequences including disruption of internal operations and may subject us to private litigation government investigations enforcement actions and cause us to incur potentially significant liability damages or remediation costs

 

we depend on third party licensors for the digital map data contained in our auto products and our business andor gross margins could be harmed if we become unable to continue licensing such mapping data or if the royalty costs for such data rise 

  

we license digital mapping data for use in our products from various sources there are only a limited number of suppliers of mapping data for each geographical region the two largest digital map suppliers are here formerly known as navteq and tomtom nv here is owned by here acquisition bv a consortium of daimler ag bmw ag and audi ag here acquisition bv is owned by competitors to other global oems who may not wish to utilize mapping content from a competitor tomtom nv is a competitor of garmin

 

although we do not foresee difficulty in continuing to license data at favorable pricing due to the long term license extension signed between garmin and here in february 2015 extending our here license agreement through 2024 if we are unable to continue licensing such mapping data and are unable to obtain an alternative source or if the nature of our relationships with here changes detrimentally our ability to supply mapping data for use in our products would be seriously harmed

  

we may have additional income tax liabilities 

  

we are subject to income taxes in switzerland the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes in the ordinary course of our business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain we are regularly under audit by tax authorities although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals the results of an audit or litigation could have a material effect on our income tax provision net income or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made

 

failure to obtain required certifications of our products on a timely basis could harm our business 

  

we have certain products especially in our aviation segment that are subject to governmental and similar certifications before they can be sold for example faa certification is required for all of our aviation products that are intended for installation in typecertificated aircraft to the extent required certification is an expensive and timeconsuming process that requires significant focus and resources an inability to obtain or excessive delay in obtaining such certifications could have an adverse effect on our ability to introduce new products and for certain aviation oem products our customers’ ability to sell airplanes delays in our obtaining certification for our aviation products have resulted and may in the future result in our being required to pay compensation to our customers therefore such inabilities or delays could adversely affect our operating results in addition we cannot assure you that our certified products will not be decertified any such decertification could have an adverse effect on our operating results

 



 

  

our business may suffer if we are not able to hire and retain sufficient qualified personnel or if we lose our key personnel 

  

our future success depends partly on the continued contribution of our key executive engineering sales marketing manufacturing and administrative personnel we currently do not have employment agreements with any of our key executive officers swiss law prohibits us from paying severance payments to our senior executive officers which may impair our ability to recruit for these positions we do not have key man life insurance on any of our key executive officers and do not currently intend to obtain such insurance the loss of the services of any of our senior level management or other key employees could harm our business recruiting and retaining the skilled personnel we require to maintain and grow our market position may be difficult for example in some recent years there has been a nationwide shortage of qualified engineers who are necessary for us to design and develop new products and therefore it has sometimes been challenging to recruit such personnel if we fail to hire and retain qualified employees we may not be able to maintain and expand our business

 

our quarterly operating results are subject to fluctuations and seasonality 

  

our operating results are difficult to predict our future quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly if such operating results decline the price of our stock could decline as we have expanded our operations our operating expenses particularly our research and development costs have increased as a percentage of our sales if revenues decrease and we continue to increase research and development costs our operating results would be negatively affected

 

historically our revenues have been weaker in the first quarter of each fiscal year as our devices are highly consumeroriented and consumer buying is traditionally lower in this quarter sales of certain of our fitness marine and automotive products tend to be higher in our second fiscal quarter due to increased consumer spending for such products in the spring season and travel season sales of many of our consumer products also have been higher in our fourth fiscal quarter due to increased consumer spending patterns on electronic devices during the holiday season in addition we attempt to time our new product releases to coincide with relatively higher consumer spending in the second and fourth fiscal quarters which contributes to these seasonal variations

  

we rely on independent dealers and distributors to sell our products and disruption to these channels would harm our business 

  

because we sell many of our products to independent dealers and distributors we are subject to many risks including risks related to their inventory levels and support for our products in particular our dealers and distributors maintain significant levels of our products in their inventories if dealers and distributors attempt to reduce their levels of inventory or if they do not maintain sufficient levels to meet customer demand our sales could be negatively impacted

 

many of our dealers and distributors also sell products offered by our competitors if our competitors offer our dealers and distributors more favorable terms those dealers and distributors may deemphasize or decline to carry our products in the future we may not be able to retain or attract a sufficient number of qualified dealers and distributors if we are unable to maintain successful relationships with dealers and distributors or to expand our distribution channels our business will suffer

  

we may pursue strategic acquisitions investments strategic partnerships or other ventures and our business could be materially harmed if we fail to successfully identify complete and integrate such transactions 

  

we intend to evaluate acquisition opportunities and opportunities to make investments in complementary businesses technologies services or products or to enter into strategic partnerships with parties who can provide access to those assets additional product or services offerings additional distribution or marketing synergies or additional industry expertise we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition investment or strategic partnership candidates or if we do identify suitable candidates in the future we may not be able to complete those transactions on commercially favorable terms or at all

 



 

 

any past or future acquisitions could also result in difficulties assimilating acquired employees operations and products and diversion of capital and management’s attention away from other business issues and opportunities integration of acquired companies may result in problems related to integration of technology and inexperienced management teams in addition the key personnel of the acquired company may decide not to work for us we may not successfully integrate internal controls compliance under the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 and other corporate governance matters operations personnel or products related to acquisitions we have made in previous years or may make in the future if we fail to successfully integrate such transactions our business could be materially harmed

 

there is uncertainty as to our shareholders’ ability to enforce certain foreign civil liabilities in switzerland and taiwan 

  

we are a swiss company and a substantial portion of our assets are located outside the united states particularly in taiwan as a result it may be difficult to effect service of process within the united states upon us in addition there is uncertainty as to whether the courts of switzerland or taiwan would recognize or enforce judgments of united states courts obtained against us predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the united states or any state thereof or be competent to hear original actions brought in switzerland or taiwan against us predicated upon the securities laws of the united states or any state thereof

 

a shut down of federal aviation administration operations would harm our business 

  

any failure of congress to appropriate funds for faa operations that results in any shut down of faa operations or furloughing of faa employees could result in delays in the required faa certification of our avionics products and in the production sale and registration of aircraft that use our avionics products such delays could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results

 

many of our products rely on the global positioning system 

  

the global positioning system gps is a satellitebased navigation and positioning system consisting of a constellation of orbiting satellites the satellites and their ground control and monitoring stations are maintained and operated by the united states department of defense the department of defense does not currently charge users for access to the satellite signals these satellites and their ground support systems are complex electronic systems subject to electronic and mechanical failures and possible sabotage the satellites were originally designed to have lives of 75 years and are subject to damage by the hostile space environment in which they operate however of the current deployment of satellites in place some have been operating for more than 20 years

 

to repair damaged or malfunctioning satellites is currently not economically feasible if a significant number of satellites were to become inoperable there could be a substantial delay before they are replaced with new satellites a reduction in the number of operating satellites may impair the current utility of the gps system and the growth of current and additional market opportunities gps satellites and ground control segments are being modernized gps modernization software updates can cause problems we depend on public access to open technical specifications in advance of gps updates

 

gps is operated by the us government which is committed to maintenance and improvement of gps however if the policy were to change and gps were no longer supported by the us government or if user fees were imposed it could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition

 

some of our products also use signals from satellite based augmentation systems sbas that augment gps such as the us wide area augmentation system waas japanese mtsatbased satellite augmentation system msas and european geostationary navigation overlay service egnos any curtailment of sbas operating capability could result in decreased user capability for many of our aviation products thereby impacting our markets

 



 

 

any of the foregoing factors could affect the willingness of buyers of our products to select global positioning systembased products instead of products based on competing technologies

 

our business is subject to disruptions and uncertainties caused by geopolitical instability war or terrorism 

 

acts of war or acts of terrorism especially any directed at the gps signals could have a material adverse impact on our business operating results and financial condition the threat of terrorism and war and heightened security and military response to this threat or any future acts of terrorism may cause a redeployment of the satellites used in gps or interruptions of the system to the extent that such interruptions have an effect on sales of our products this could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition

  

a shut down of airspace or imposition of restrictions on general aviation would harm our business the shutdown of airspace could cause reduced sales of our general aviation products and delays in the shipment of our products manufactured in our taiwan manufacturing facilities to our global distribution facilities thereby adversely affecting our ability to supply new and existing products to our dealers and distributors

 

any reallocation or repurposing of radio frequency spectrum could cause harmful interference with the reception of global positioning system signals this interference could harm our business 

  

our global positioning system technology is dependent on the use of the standard positioning service sps provided by the us government’s global positioning system satellites the global positioning system operates in radio frequency bands that are globally allocated for radio navigation satellite services international allocations of radio frequency are made by the international telecommunications union itu a specialized technical agency of the united nations these allocations are further governed by radio regulations that have treaty status and which may be subject to modification every two to three years by the world radio communication conference each country also has regulatory authority on how each band is used in the united states the federal communications commission fcc and the national telecommunications and information administration ntia share responsibility for radio frequency allocations and spectrum usage regulations

 

any itu or national reallocation of radio frequency spectrum including frequency band segmentation or sharing of spectrum or other modifications of the permitted uses of relevant frequency bands may materially and adversely affect the utility and reliability of our products and have significant negative impacts on our business and our customers

  

we may be exposed to certain regulatory and financial risks related to climate change 

 

climate change is receiving increasing attention worldwide some scientists legislators and others attribute global warming to increased levels of greenhouse gases including carbon dioxide which has led to significant legislative and regulatory efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions

 

various regulatory and legislative measures to address greenhouse gas emissions are in different phases of implementation or discussion in the aftermath of its 2009 “endangerment finding” that greenhouse gas emissions pose a threat to human health and welfare the environmental protection agency has begun to regulate greenhouse gas emissions under the authority granted to it under the clean air act at the federal legislative level congressional passage of legislation adopting some form of federal mandatory greenhouse gas emission reduction such as a nationwide capandtrade program does not appear likely at this time although it could be adopted at a future date it is also possible that congress may pass alternative climate change bills that do not mandate a nationwide capandtrade program and instead focus on promoting renewable energy and energy efficiency which could increase the cost of doing business 

 



 

 

because it is uncertain what laws and regulations will be enacted we cannot predict the potential impact of such laws and regulations on our future consolidated financial condition results of operations or cash flows

 

risks relating to our shares 

  

the volatility of our stock price could adversely affect investment in our common shares 

 

the market price of our common shares has been and may continue to be highly volatile during 2015 the closing price of our common shares ranged from a low of 3228 to a high of 5681 a variety of factors could cause the price of our common shares to fluctuate perhaps substantially including

 

              

in addition in recent years the stock market in general and the markets for shares of technology companies in particular have experienced extreme price fluctuations which have often been unrelated to the operating performance of affected companies any such fluctuations in the future could adversely affect the market price of our common shares

  

our officers and directors exert substantial influence over us 

  

as of january 25 2016 current members and former members of our board of directors and our executive officers together with members of their families and entities that may be deemed affiliates of or related to such persons or entities beneficially owned approximately 411 of our outstanding common shares accordingly these shareholders may be able to determine the outcome of corporate actions requiring shareholder approval such as mergers and acquisitions and shareholder proposals this level of ownership may have a significant effect in delaying deferring or preventing a change in control of garmin and may adversely affect the voting and other rights of other holders of our common shares

  



 

  

the rights of our shareholders are governed by swiss law 

 

the rights of our shareholders are governed by swiss law and garmin ltd’s articles of association the rights of shareholders under swiss law differ from the rights of shareholders of companies incorporated in other jurisdictions for example swiss law allows our shareholders acting at a shareholders’ meeting to authorize share capital that can be issued by the board of directors without approval of a shareholders’ meeting but this authorization is limited to 50 of the existing registered share capital and must be renewed at a shareholders’ meeting at least every two years for it to continue to be available additionally subject to specified exceptions including the exceptions described in our articles of association swiss law grants preemptive rights to existing shareholders to subscribe for new issuances of shares and other securities swiss law also does not provide as much flexibility in the various terms that can attach to different classes of shares as the laws of some other jurisdictions swiss law also reserves for approval by shareholders certain corporate actions over which a board of directors would have authority in some other jurisdictions for example swiss law provides that dividends and other distributions must be approved by shareholders at the general meeting of shareholders these swiss law requirements relating to our capital management may limit our flexibility and situations may arise where greater flexibility would have provided substantial benefits to our shareholders

 

the company has limited capital reserves from which to make distributions or repurchase shares without subjecting you to swiss withholding tax 

 

if we are unable to make distributions if any through a reduction of par value or to pay dividends if any out of qualifying capital contribution reserves then any dividends paid by us will generally be subject to a swiss federal withholding tax at a rate of 35 over the long term the amount of par value and qualifying capital contribution reserves available for us to use for par value reductions or dividends will be limited the withholding tax must be withheld from the gross distribution and paid to the swiss federal tax administration a us holder that qualifies for benefits under the convention between the united states of america and the swiss confederation for the avoidance of double taxation with respect to taxes on income may apply for a refund of the tax withheld in excess of the 15 treaty rate or in excess of the 5 reduced treaty rate for qualifying corporate shareholders with at least 10 participation in our voting stock or for a full refund in case of qualified pension funds however there can be no assurance that our shareholders will approve a reduction in par value or a dividend out of qualifying capital contribution reserves that we will be able to meet the other legal requirements for a reduction in par value or that swiss withholding rules will not be changed in the future or that a change in swiss law will not adversely affect us or our shareholders in particular as a result of distributions out of qualifying capital contribution reserves becoming subject to additional corporate law or other restrictions if we are unable to make a distribution through a reduction in par value or to pay a dividend out of qualifying capital contribution reserves we may not be able to make distributions without subjecting you to swiss withholding taxes

 

under current swiss tax law repurchases of shares for the purposes of capital reduction are treated as a partial liquidation subject to 35 swiss withholding tax on the difference between the par value and the repurchase price however the portion of the repurchase price that is attributed to qualifying capital contribution reserves of the shares repurchased will not be subject to the swiss withholding tax therefore repurchase of our own shares further limits the amount of qualifying capital reserves available for distributions to shareholders free of swiss withholding taxes no partial liquidation treatment applies and no withholding tax is triggered if the shares are not repurchased for cancellation but held by us as treasury shares to the extent sufficient qualifying capital reserves are available however should we not resell such treasury shares within six years and there is not sufficient qualifying capital contribution reserves the withholding tax becomes due at the end of the six year period 

 

we may follow a share repurchase process for future share repurchases if any similar to a second trading line on the six swiss exchange in which swiss institutional investors buy shares on the open market and sell these shares to us and are generally able to receive a refund of the swiss withholding tax however if we are unable to use this process successfully we may not be able to repurchase shares for the purposes of capital reduction without subjecting you to swiss withholding taxes if and to the extent that the repurchase of shares is made out of retained earnings or other taxable reserves no withholding tax would be applicable if and to the extent that qualifying capital contribution reserves are attributable to the share repurchase

 



 

 

we have certain limitations on our ability to repurchase and hold our own shares 

  

under swiss law we have certain limitations on our ability to repurchase and hold our own shares we and our subsidiaries may only repurchase and hold our own shares to the extent that sufficient freely distributable reserves including contributed surplus as determined for swiss tax and statutory purposes are available the aggregate par value of our registered shares held by us and our subsidiaries may not exceed 10 of our registered share capital we may repurchase our registered shares beyond the statutory limit of 10 however if our shareholders have adopted a resolution at a general meeting of shareholders authorizing the board of directors to repurchase registered shares in an amount in excess of 10 and the repurchased shares are dedicated for cancellation our ability to repurchase and hold our own shares is a significant component of our capital management and shareholder return practices that we believe is important to our shareholders and any restriction on our ability to repurchase our shares could make our stock less attractive to investors

 

as mentioned previously we do not believe that we or any of our united states or nonunited states subsidiaries are currently a controlled foreign corporation cfc for united states federal income tax purposes however the repurchase of the company’s shares reduces the number of shares outstanding which is the basis for determining the ownership percentages for determination of whether the united states shareholders own more than fifty percent of the voting power or value of the company only united states persons that own ten percent or more of the voting power of the company’s shares qualify as united states shareholders we may be limited in the number of shares we repurchase due to united states shareholders holding percentages

unless otherwise indicated dollar amounts set forth in the tables are in thousands except per share data

 

overview 

 

we are a leading worldwide provider of navigation communications and information devices most of which are enabled by global positioning system or gps technology we operate in five business segments which serve the marine outdoor fitness auto and aviation markets our segments offer products through our network of subsidiary distributors and independent dealers and distributors however the nature of products and types of customers for the five segments can vary significantly as such the segments are managed separately

 

since our first products were delivered in 1991 we have generated positive income from operations each year and have funded our growth from these profits

 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

  

general 

 

garmin’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon garmin’s consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the presentation of these financial statements requires garmin to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis garmin evaluates its estimates including those related to customer sales programs and incentives product returns bad debts inventories investments intangible assets income taxes warranty obligations and contingencies and litigation garmin bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions

 



 

 

for information on each of the following critical accounting policies andor estimates refer to the discussion in the notes to the consolidated financial statements as indicated in the table below

  

   

accounting terms and characteristics 

  

net sales 

 

our net sales are primarily generated through sales to our retail partners dealer and distributor network and to original equipment manufacturers refer to the revenue recognition discussion in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements our sales are largely of a consumer nature therefore backlog levels are not necessarily indicative of our future sales results we aim to achieve a quick turnaround on orders we receive and we typically ship most orders within 72 hours

 

net sales are subject to seasonal fluctuation typically sales of our consumer products are highest in the second quarter due to increased demand during the spring and summer season and in the fourth quarter due to increased demand during the holiday buying season our aviation products do not experience much seasonal variation but are more influenced by the timing of aircraft certifications and the release of new products when the initial demand is typically the strongest

 

cost of salesgross profit 

 

raw material costs are our most significant component of cost of goods sold our existing practice of performing the design and manufacture of our products inhouse has enabled us to source components from different suppliers and where possible to redesign our products to leverage lower cost components we believe that our flexible production model allows our xizhi jhongli and linkou manufacturing plants in taiwan yangzhou china and our olathe kansas and salem oregon manufacturing plants in the us to experience relatively low costs of manufacturing in general products manufactured in taiwan have been our highest volume products our manufacturing labor costs historically have been lower in taiwan than in olathe and salem the yangzhou china facility was opened in 2015

 

sales price variability has had and can be expected to have an effect on our gross profit in the past prices of our devices sold into the auto market have declined due to market pressures and introduction of new products sold at lower price points in recent years pricing has stabilized in auto allowing for relatively stable gross margins excluding the impact of deferred revenues and costs the average selling prices of our aviation outdoor fitness and marine products have historically been stable due to product mix and the introduction of more advanced products sold at higher prices in 2014 and 2015 fitness pricing declined due to high volumes of lowerpriced activity trackers the effect of the sales price differences inherent within the mix of products sold could have a significant impact on our gross profit

  

advertising expense 

  

our advertising expenses consist of costs for media advertising cooperative advertising with our retail partners point of sale displays and sponsorships

 



 

 

selling general and administrative expenses 

 

our selling general and administrative expenses consist primarily of

 

 

 

research and development 

 

the majority of our research and development costs represent salaries for our engineers costs for high technology components and costs of test equipment used in product and prototype development

 

we are committed to increasing the level of innovative design and development of new products as we strive for expanded ability to serve our existing consumer and aviation markets as well as new markets for active lifestyle products

 

income taxes 

 

we have experienced a relatively low effective corporate tax rate due to the proportion of our revenue generated by entities in tax jurisdictions with low statutory rates in particular the profit entitlement afforded our swissbased companies based on their intellectual property rights ownership of our consumer products along with tax incentives offered by the taiwanese government on certain hightechnology capital investments have contributed to our relatively low effective corporate tax rate 

 

results of operations 

  

the following table sets forth our results of operations as a percentage of net sales during the periods shown the table may not foot due to rounding

 

  



 

 

the following table sets forth our results of operations through operating income for each of our five segments during the period shown for each line item in the table the total of the segments’ amounts equals the amount in the consolidated statements of income data included in item 6

 

  

  

  



 

 

comparison of 52weeks ended december 26 2015 and december 27 2014 

 

net sales 

  

   

net sales decreased 2 in 2015 when compared to the yearago period all segments excluding aviation were impacted by revenues denominated in currencies that have weakened against the us dollar in total it is estimated that the strong us dollar reduced revenues by approximately 189 million which represents 6 of revenue auto revenue remains the largest portion of our revenue mix at 37 in the fiscal year 2015 compared to 43 in the fiscal year 2014

 

total unit sales increased 7 to 162 million units in 2015 from 151 million units in 2014 the increase in unit sales volume was attributable to fitness and marine volumes partially offset by declines in each of the other segments

 

auto segment revenue decreased 15 from the yearago period as both the contribution of amortization of previously deferred revenue declined when compared to 2014 and volumes declined fitness revenues increased 16 on the strength of our wearables portfolio aviation revenues increased 3 from the yearago period as market share gains were partially offset by industry weakness outdoor revenues decreased 1 from the yearago period due to geographic exposure to weak currencies and maturing product categories largely offset by the strength of outdoor wearables revenues in our marine segment increased 15 as the release of new marine products drove strong revenue growth

 

the company anticipates revenue of approximately 282 billion in 2016 driven by growth in the outdoor fitness aviation and marine segments offset by ongoing declines in the auto segment in general management believes that continuous innovation and the introduction of new products are essential for future revenue growth

 

cost of goods sold 

 

  

cost of goods sold increased 1 in absolute dollars for fiscal year 2015 when compared to fiscal year 2014 cost of goods as a percentage of revenue increased in part due to a stronger us dollar that created downward pressure on revenue in all segments excluding aviation as discussed above

 

in the auto segment the cost of goods decline was largely consistent with the segment revenue decline in the fitness segment the cost of goods increase outpaced revenue growth due to product mix and competitive pricing dynamics the cost of goods increases in marine are due to increased sales of higher margin products aviation cost of goods was lower due to product mix

 



 

 

management believes that cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales will be relatively consistent in 2016

  

gross profit 

 

  

gross profit dollars in fiscal year 2015 decreased 4 while gross profit margin decreased 130 basis points compared to fiscal year 2014 with all segments declining excluding marine and aviation segment specific gross margin drivers are discussed above

  

management believes that total company gross margins will be relatively consistent in 2016

 

advertising expenses 

 

  

advertising expense increased 14 in absolute dollars while increasing 80 basis points as a percent of revenues the increase in absolute dollars occurred in fitness and marine to support new product introductions with increased media spend point of sale presence at key retailers and cooperative advertising this was partially offset by decreased spending in auto due to reduced cooperative advertising associated with lower volumes and in outdoor due to fewer new product categories

 

management expects advertising expense in absolute dollars and as a percentage of sales to be relatively flat in 2016

 

selling general and administrative expenses 

 

  

selling general and administrative expense increased 6 in absolute dollars and 100 basis points as a percent of revenues compared to fiscal year 2014 the absolute dollar increase is primarily related to litigation related costs information technology costs and product support variances by segment are primarily due to the allocation of certain selling general and administrative expenses based on percentage of total revenues marine expense growth exceeded other segments due to specific litigation matters

 



 

 

management expects selling general and administrative expenses to increase in absolute dollars and as a percentage of sales in 2016 due primarily to acquisitions

 

research and development expense 

 

  

research and development expense increased 8 due to ongoing development activities for new products and additional engineering personnel throughout fiscal year 2015 in absolute dollars research and development costs increased 319 million when compared with fiscal year 2014 and increased 140 basis points as a percent of revenue our research and development spending is focused on product development improving existing software capabilities and exploring new categories

 

management believes that one of the key strategic initiatives for future growth and success of garmin is continuous innovation development and introduction of new products management expects that its research and development expenses will increase during fiscal 2016 on an absolute dollar basis and as a percent of revenue in order to deliver innovative new products and technologies

 

operating income 

 

   

as a result of the above operating income decreased 20 in absolute dollars and 460 basis points as a percent of revenue when compared to the fiscal year 2014 declining gross margin percentages and increases in all operating expenses as a percentage of revenue as discussed above contributed to the decline

  

other income expense 

 

  



 

 

the average return on cash and investments during the fiscal years of 2015 and 2014 were 12 and 13 respectively the decrease in interest income is attributable to decreasing cash and investment balances and a slight decrease in the interest rates

 

foreign currency gains and losses for the company are primarily tied to movements by the taiwan dollar the euro and the british pound sterling in relation to the us dollar the taiwan dollar is the functional currency of garmin corporation the us dollar remains the functional currency of garmin europe ltd the euro is the functional currency of most european subsidiaries as these entities have grown currency fluctuations can generate material gains and losses the majority of the company’s consolidated foreign currency gain or loss results from the significant cash and marketable securities receivables and payables held in a currency other than the functional currency at one of the company’s subsidiaries additionally eurobased intercompany transactions can also generate currency gains and losses due to the relative size of the entities using a functional currency other than the taiwan dollar the euro and the british pound sterling currency fluctuations related to these entities are not expected to have a material impact on the company’s financial statements

 

the majority of the 235 million currency loss in the fiscal year 2015 was due to the strengthening of the us dollar compared to the euro the strengthening of the us dollar compared to the taiwan dollar contributed an offsetting gain the movements of the taiwan dollar and euro have offsetting impacts when the currencies move congruently against the us dollar due to the use of the taiwan dollar for manufacturing costs and cash held in nonfunctional currency while the euro transactions relate primarily to revenue during fiscal year 2015 the us dollar strengthened 100 compared to the euro resulting in a net loss of 312 million this was largely offset as the us dollar strengthened 38 compared to the taiwan dollar resulting in a gain of 195 million the remaining net currency loss of 118 million is related to other currencies and timing of transactions

 

the majority of the 43 million currency loss in the fiscal year 2014 was due to the strengthening of the us dollar compared to the euro and the british pound sterling the strengthening of the us dollar compared to the taiwan dollar contributed an offsetting gain during fiscal year 2014 the us dollar strengthened 114 compared to the euro and 55 compared to the british pound sterling resulting in a net loss of 437 million this was more than offset as the us dollar strengthened 55 compared to the taiwan dollar resulting in a gain of 448 million the remaining net currency loss of 54 million is related to other currencies and timing of transactions

 

during fiscal year 2015 garmin recorded other income of 114 million this income was primarily due to a legal settlement received during the year and a gain on the disposal of property

 

income tax provision 

  

our income tax expense decreased by 2486 million to 1110 million for the fiscal year 2015 from 3595 million for the fiscal year 2014 contributing to the significant decrease was

 

  

partially offset by

 

  

in addition the full year income mix by tax jurisdiction for 2015 compared to 2014 is unfavorable resulting in an increased effective tax rate

 

in the third quarter of 2014 the company initiated an intercompany restructuring that realigned our corporate entity structure this change in corporate structure provides access to historical earnings that were previously permanently reinvested and allows us to efficiently repatriate future earnings as a result of the change in corporate structure garmin recorded tax expense of 3076 million   the first and second cash tax payments of 781 million and 1828 million associated with the restructuring were made in the third quarter of 2014 and the second quarter of 2015 respectively the remainder of the accrued tax will be paid incrementally as the cash is repatriated 

 



 

 

the company expects the effective income tax rate to be approximately 205 in 2016

 

net income 

 

as a result of the various factors noted above net income increased 25 to 4562 million for the fiscal year 2015 compared to 3642 million for the fiscal year 2014

  

comparison of 52weeks ended december 27 2014 and december 28 2013 

 

net sales 

 

  

net sales increased 9 in 2014 when compared to the yearago period all segments excluding auto grew in the fiscal year 2014 auto revenue remains the largest portion of our revenue mix at 43 in the fiscal year 2014 compared to 49 in the fiscal year 2013

 

total unit sales increased 9 to 151 million units in 2014 from 139 million units in 2013 the increase in unit sales volume was attributable to growth in all segments except auto which had volume decline due to penetration rates and competing technologies

 

auto segment revenue decreased 5 from fiscal year 2013 as a 10 volume decline and slight average selling price asp decline were partially offset by amortization of previously deferred revenue exceeding current period revenue deferrals and increased auto oem contributions revenues in our fitness segment increased 60 from fiscal year 2013 on the strength of wellness products first introduced in 2014 and recent biking and running product introductions aviation revenues increased 14 from fiscal year 2013 as both oem market share gains and aftermarket strength contributed to growth outdoor revenues increased 4 from fiscal year 2013 primarily due to strong sales of fēnix 2 and our lineup of dog tracking and training products offset by declining sales of our handheld products which serve a mature industry revenues in our marine segment increased 11 due to both the recent acquisition of fusion electronics as well as new product introductions this growth was partially offset by a competitive pricing environment in the global marine electronics industry

cost of goods sold increased 3 in absolute dollars for fiscal year 2014 when compared to fiscal year 2013 the increase was driven by growth in all segments excluding auto fitness and marine cost of goods increased inline with sales growth as described above with gross margins stable yearoveryear outdoor cost of goods increased due to sales growth with gross margin contraction driven by product mix

 



 

 

as a percentage of revenue cost of goods sold decreased 240 basis points from fiscal year 2013 with improvement or stability in each segment excluding outdoor as mentioned above the auto cost of goods improvement as a percent of revenues was primarily due to benefit from the amortization of previously deferred revenue and costs exceeding new deferrals on current period sales in 2014 aviation margin improvement was primarily due to increased contribution of software sales which carry a higher margin

 

gross profit 

 

  

gross profit dollars in fiscal year 2014 increased 14 while gross profit margin increased 240 basis points compared to fiscal year 2013 with all segments stable or improving excluding outdoor the auto fitness marine and aviation segments recorded improved gross margins as discussed above outdoor gross profit margins declined as discussed above

  

advertising expenses 

 

  

advertising expense increased 30 in absolute dollars while increasing 80 basis points as a percent of revenues the increase in absolute dollars occurred primarily in outdoor and fitness to support new product introductions and was partially offset by decreased spending in auto due to reduced cooperative advertising associated with lower volumes aviation advertising increased materially due to increased cooperative advertising efforts with our dealers

  

selling general and administrative expenses 

 

  

selling general and administrative expense increased 5 in absolute dollars and declined 50 basis points as a percent of revenues compared to fiscal year 2013 the absolute dollar increase is primarily related to product support information technology costs and legal costs specific to marine litigation the aviation increase was primarily driven by product support costs other variances by segment excluding aviation are primarily due to the allocation of certain selling general and administrative expenses based on percentage of total revenues

 



 

  

research and development expense 

 

  

research and development expense increased 8 due to ongoing development activities for new products and the addition of over 200 new engineering personnel to our staff since the fiscal year 2013 in absolute dollars research and development costs increased 302 million when compared with fiscal year 2013 and decreased 10 basis points as a percent of revenue fitness outdoor and aviation increased to support new product initiatives auto investment declined due to efforts to allocate research and development spending to areas with the highest growth potential

  

operating income 

 

   

as a result of the above operating income increased 20 in absolute dollars and 220 basis points as a percent of revenue when compared to the fiscal year 2013 revenue growth and an improving gross margin percentage as discussed above contributed to the growth by segment results are discussed above

  

other income expense 

 

  

the average return on cash and investments during the fiscal years of 2014 and 2013 were 13 and 14 respectively the slight increase in interest income was offset by fewer capital gains on investments in 2014 which is recorded as other income

 



 

 

the majority of the 43 million currency loss in the fiscal year 2014 was due to the strengthening of the us dollar compared to the euro and the british pound sterling the strengthening of the us dollar compared to the taiwan dollar contributed an offsetting gain the movements of the taiwan dollar and eurobritish pound sterling have offsetting impacts when the currencies move congruently against the us dollar due to the use of the taiwan dollar for manufacturing costs and cash held in nonfunctional currency while the euro and british pound sterling transactions relate primarily to revenue during fiscal year 2014 the us dollar strengthened 114 compared to the euro and 55 compared to the british pound sterling resulting in a net loss of 437 million this was more than offset as the us dollar strengthened 55 compared to the taiwan dollar resulting in a gain of 448 million the remaining net currency loss of 54 million is related to other currencies and timing of transactions

 

the majority of the 355 million currency gain in 2013 was due to the strengthening of the us dollar compared to the taiwan dollar the weakening of the us dollar compared to the euro and british pound sterling contributed additional gains during 2013 the us dollar weakened 41 and 22 respectively relative to the euro and british pound sterling resulting in a foreign currency gain of 75 million in garmin ltd and our european subsidiaries the us dollar strengthened 33 against the taiwan dollar resulting in a 302 million foreign currency gain due to the fluctuation of asset balances throughout the year the net result of these currency moves combined with other losses of 21 million and the timing of transactions during the year was a net gain of 355 million for the company

  

income tax provision 

  

our income tax expense increased by 3184 million to 3595 million for the fiscal year 2014 from 411 million for the fiscal year 2013 contributing to the significant increase were

 

    

partially offset by favorable impacts including

 

  

net income 

 

as a result of the various factors noted above net income decreased 41 to 3642 million for the fiscal year 2014 compared to 6124 million for fiscal year 2013

 

liquidity and capital resources 

 

operating activities 

 

  

the 2422 million decrease in cash provided by operating activities in fiscal year 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014 was primarily due to the following

 

   



 

 

   

partially offset by

 

      

the 1074 million decrease in cash provided by operating activities in fiscal year 2014 compared to fiscal year 2013 was primarily due to the following

 

     

partially offset by

 

      



 

 

we expect to generate 475 million of cash flow from operations in 2016 with ongoing net income

 

investing activities 

 

  

the 2433 million decrease in cash provided by investing activities in fiscal year 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014 was primarily due to the following

 

    

the 4058 million increase in cash provided by investing activities in fiscal year 2014 compared to fiscal year 2013 was primarily due to the following

 

   

partially offset by

 

    

we have budgeted approximately 75 million of capital expenditures during fiscal 2016 to include some facility expansion along with normal ongoing capital expenditures and maintenance activities it is management’s goal to invest the onhand cash consistent with garmin’s investment policy which has been approved by the board of directors the investment policy’s primary purpose is to preserve capital maintain an acceptable degree of liquidity and maximize yield within the constraint of low credit risk garmin’s average return on cash and investments during fiscal 2015 2014 and 2013 were approximately 12 13 and 14 respectively

 

the company’s investment policy requires investments to be rated a or better with the objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss the fair value of our securities varies from period to period due to changes in interest rates in the performance of the underlying collateral and in the credit performance of the underlying issuer among other factors see footnote 3 for additional information regarding marketable securities

 

financing activities 

 

  



 

 

the 995 million decrease in cash used in financing activities in fiscal year 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014 was primarily due to the following

 

  

partially offset by

 

  

the 1928 million increase in cash used in financing activities in fiscal year 2014 compared to fiscal year 2013 was primarily due to the following

 

   

our dividend has progressively increased from 045 per share for the eight calendar quarters beginning in june 2012 to 048 per share for the four calendar quarters beginning in june 2014 to 051 per share for the four quarters beginning in june 2015

  

we currently use cash flow from operations to fund our capital expenditures to support our working capital requirements and to pay dividends we expect that future cash requirements will principally be for capital expenditures working capital payment of dividends declared share repurchases and the funding of strategic acquisitions we believe that our existing cash balances and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our longterm projected capital expenditures working capital and other cash requirements

  

contractual obligations and commercial commitments 

 

future commitments of garmin as of december 26 2015 aggregated by type of contractual obligation are

 

  

the company is party to certain commitments which include purchases of raw materials advertising expenditures investments in certain low income housing tax credit projects and other indirect purchases in connection with conducting our business the aggregate amount of purchase orders and other commitments open as of december 26 2015 was approximately 2783 million we cannot determine the aggregate amount of such purchase orders that represent contractual obligations because purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements our purchase orders are based on our current needs and are typically fulfilled within short periods of time

 

we may be required to make significant cash outlays related to unrecognized tax benefits however due to the uncertainty of the timing of future cash flows associated with our unrecognized tax benefits we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement if any with the respective taxing authorities accordingly unrecognized tax benefits of 979 million as of december 26 2015 have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above for further information related to unrecognized tax benefits see note 2 “income taxes” to the consolidated financial statements included in this report

  



 

  

offbalance sheet arrangements 

 

we do not have any offbalance sheet arrangements

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

market sensitivity 

 

we have market risk primarily in connection with the pricing of our products and services and the purchase of raw materials product pricing and raw materials costs are both significantly influenced by semiconductor market conditions historically during cyclical industry downturns we have been able to offset pricing declines for our products through a combination of improved product mix and success in obtaining price reductions in raw materials costs

  

inflation 

 

we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our business financial condition or results of operations if our costs were to become subject to significant inflationary pressures we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs through price increases our inability or failure to do so could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations

 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

 

the operation of garmin’s subsidiaries in international markets results in exposure to movements in currency exchange rates we have experienced significant foreign currency gains and losses due to the strengthening and weakening of the us dollar the potential of volatile foreign exchange rate fluctuations in the future could have a significant effect on our results of operations the company has not historically hedged its foreign currency exchange rate risks

 

the currencies that create a majority of the company’s exchange rate exposure are the taiwan dollar euro and british pound sterling garmin corporation headquartered in xizhi taiwan uses the local currency as the functional currency the company translates all assets and liabilities at yearend exchange rates and income and expense accounts at average rates during the year in order to minimize the effect of the currency exchange fluctuations on our net assets we have elected to retain most of our taiwan subsidiary’s cash and investments in marketable securities denominated in us dollars

 

most european subsidiaries use the euro as the functional currency  the functional currency of our largest european subsidiary garmin europe ltd remains the us dollar and as some transactions occurred in british pounds sterling or euros foreign currency gains or losses have been realized historically related to the movements of those currencies relative to the us dollar the company believes that gains and losses will become more material in the future as our european presence grows in 2015 the us dollar strengthened 100 relative to the euro resulting in a foreign currency loss of 312 million in garmin ltd and our european subsidiaries the us dollar strengthened 38 against the taiwan dollar resulting in a 195 million foreign currency gain due to the fluctuation of asset balances throughout the year the net result of these currency moves combined with other losses of 118 million and the timing of transactions during the year was a net loss of 235 million for the company and a cumulative translation adjustment of 350 million during the fiscal year 2015

 

we assessed the company’s exposure to movements in currency exchange rates by performing a sensitivity analysis of adverse changes in exchange rates and the corresponding impact to our results of operations based on monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than respective functional currencies as of december 26 2015 and december 27 2014 hypothetical and reasonably possible adverse changes of 10 for the taiwan dollar euro and british pound sterling would have resulted in an adverse impact on income before income taxes of approximately 95 million and 118 million at december 26 2015 and december 27 2014

 



 

 

interest rate risk 

 

we have no outstanding longterm debt as of december 26 2015 we therefore have no meaningful debtrelated interest rate risk

 

we are exposed to interest rate risk in connection with our investments in marketable securities as interest rates change the unrealized gains and losses associated with those securities will fluctuate accordingly

the company’s investment policy requires investments to be rated a or better with the objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss the company does not intend to sell securities in an unrealized loss position and it is not more likely than not that the company will be required to sell such investments before recovery of their amortized costs bases which may be maturity during 2015 and 2014 the company did not record any material impairment charges on its outstanding securities

 

we assessed the company’s exposure to interest rate risk by performing a sensitivity analysis of a parallel shift in the yield curve and the corresponding impact to the company’s portfolio of marketable securities based on balance sheet positions as of december 26 2015 and december 27 2014 the hypothetical and reasonably possible 100 basis point increases in interest rates across all maturities would have resulted in declines in portfolio fair market value of approximately 43 million and 52 million at december 26 2015 and december 27 2014 such losses would only be realized if the company sold the investments prior to maturity

competition 

  

in general we operate in highly competitive markets though competitive conditions do vary among our diverse products and geographies garmin believes the principal competitive factors impacting the market for its products are design functionality quality and reliability customer service brand price timetomarket and availability garmin believes that it generally competes favorably in each of these areas and as such is generally a significant competitor in each of our major markets

 

garmin believes that its principal competitors for portable automotive products are tomtom nv and mitac digital corporation mitac which distributes products under the brand names of magellan mio and navman garmin believes that its principal competitors for infotainment solutions are harman international industries panasonic corporation and the mitsubishi group garmin believes that its principal competitors for outdoor product lines are bushnell delorme lowrance electronics inc a subsidiary of navico “lowrance” magellan a subsidiary of mitac  sportdog brand and suunto oy for mobile products garmin believes that its principal competitors are google inc apple inc and telenav inc garmin believes that its principal competitors for fitness products are bryton corp fitbit inc aliphcom dba jawbone polar electro oy sigma sports suunto oy and timex corp for marine products garmin believes that its principal competitors are furuno electronic company the humminbird division of johnson outdoors inc navico and flir systems inc for garmin’s aviation product lines garmin considers its principal competitors to be aspen avionics avidyne corporation chelton flight systems cmc electronics free flight systems honeywell inc l3 avionics systems rockwell collins inc sagem avionics inc and universal avionics systems corporation

 





 

research and development 

 

garmin’s product innovations are driven by its strong emphasis on research and development and the close partnership between garmin’s engineering and manufacturing teams garmin’s products are created by its engineering and development staff which numbered 3386 people worldwide as of december 27 2014 garmin’s manufacturing staff includes manufacturing process engineers who work closely with garmin’s design engineers to ensure manufacturability and manufacturing cost control for its products garmin’s development staff includes industrial designers as well as software engineers electrical engineers mechanical engineers and cartographic engineers garmin believes the industrial design of its products has played an important role in garmin’s success once a development project is initiated and approved a multidisciplinary team is created to design the product and transition it into manufacturing

 

below is a table of garmin’s expenditures on research and development over the last three fiscal years 

 

  

manufacturing and operations 

 

garmin believes one of its core competencies and strengths is its vertically integrated manufacturing capabilities at its taiwan facilities in xizhi jhongli and linkou and at its us facilities in olathe kansas and salem oregon garmin believes that its ownership and operation of its own manufacturing facilities and distribution networks provides significant capability and flexibility to address the breadth and depth of resources necessary to serve its diverse products and markets

 

specifically garmin believes that its vertical integration of it manufacturing capabilities provides advantages to product cost quality and time to market

 

cost garmin’s manufacturing resources rapidly and iteratively prototype designs concepts products and processes achieving higher efficiency resulting in lower cost garmin’s vertical integration approach enables leveraging our manufacturing resources across high mid and low volume products sharing of these resources across our product lines favorably affects garmin’s costs to produce its range of products with lower volume products realizing the economies of scale of the high volume products the ownership and integration of our resources allows garmin to optimize the design for manufacturing of our products yielding improved cost

 

quality garmin’s automation and sophisticated production processes provide inservice robustness and consistent reliability standards that enables garmin to maintain strict process and quality control of the products manufactured thereby improving the overall quality of our products additionally the immediate feedback throughout the manufacturing processes is provided to the development teams providing integrated continuous improvement throughout design and supply chain

 

time to market garmin uses multidisciplinary teams of design engineers process engineers and supply chain specialists to develop products allowing them to quickly move from concept to manufacturing this integrated ownership provides inherent flexibility to enable faster time to market

 

garmin’s design manufacturing distribution and servicing processes in its us taiwan and uk facilities are certified to iso 9001 an international quality standard developed by the international organization for standardization garmin’s automotive operations in taiwan and olathe have achieved ts 16949 certification a quality standard for automotive suppliers garmin’s olathe and salem aviation operations have achieved certification to as9100 the quality standard for the aviation industry

 





 

garmin international inc garmin europe ltd and garmin corporation have also achieved certification of their environmental management systems to the iso 14001 standard recognizing garmin’s systems and processes which minimize or prevent harmful effects on the environment and to strive continually to improve its environmental performance

 

materials 

 

although most components essential to garmin’s business are generally available from multiple sources certain key components are currently obtained by the company from single or limited sources which subjects garmin to supply and pricing risks many of these and other key components that are available from multiple sources including but not limited to nand flash memory dynamic random access memory dram gps chipsets and certain lcds are subject at times to industrywide shortages and commodity pricing fluctuations

 

garmin and other participants in the personal computer tablet mobile communication aviation electronics and consumer electronics industries also compete for various components with other industries that have experienced increased demand for their products in addition garmin uses some custom components that are not common to the rest of the personal computer tablet mobile communication and consumer electronics industries and new products introduced by the company often utilize custom components available from only one source until garmin has evaluated whether there is a need for and subsequently qualifies additional suppliers when a component or product uses new technologies initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields have matured or manufacturing capacity has increased garmin makes efforts to manage risks in these areas through the use of supply agreements for strategically important components nevertheless if garmin’s supply of a key singlesourced component for a new or existing product was delayed or constrained if such components were available only at significantly higher prices or if a key manufacturing vendor delayed shipments of completed products to garmin garmin’s financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected garmin’s business and financial performance could also be adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the original source or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source continued availability of these components at acceptable prices or at all may be affected if those suppliers decided to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet garmin’s requirements

  

seasonality 

  

our sales are subject to seasonal fluctuation sales of our consumer products are generally higher in the fourth quarter due to increased demand during the holiday buying season and to a lesser extent the second quarter due to increased demand during the spring and summer season and the mother’s dayfather’s daygraduation buying season sales of consumer products are also influenced by the timing of the release of new products our aviation products do not experience much seasonal variation but are more influenced by the timing of the release of new products when the initial demand is typically the strongest

  

backlog 

 

our sales are generally of a consumer nature and there is a relatively short cycle between order and shipment therefore we believe that backlog information is not material to the understanding of our business we typically ship most orders within 72 hours of receipt

  

intellectual property 

  

our success and ability to compete is dependent in part on our proprietary technology we rely on a combination of patent copyright trademark and trade secret laws as well as confidentiality agreements to establish and protect our proprietary rights in addition garmin often relies on licenses of intellectual property for use in its business for example garmin obtains licenses for digital cartography technology for use in our products from various sources

 





 

as of january 19 2015 garmin’s worldwide ip portfolio includes over 880 patent and 610 trademark registrations issued worldwide for the past seven years garmin has been selected as a constituent of the ocean tomo ® 300 patent index which recognizes companies with high intellectual property value we believe that our continued success depends on the intellectual skills of our employees and their ability to continue to innovate garmin will continue to file and prosecute patent applications when appropriate to attempt to protect garmin’s rights in its proprietary technologies 

 

there is no assurance that our current patents or patents which we may later acquire may successfully withstand any challenge in whole or in part it is also possible that any patent issued to us may not provide us with any competitive advantages or that the patents of others will preclude us from manufacturing and marketing certain products despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights to protect our trade secrets to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others or to defend against claims of infringement or invalidity

  

regulations 

  

the telecommunications industry is highly regulated and the regulatory environment in which garmin operates is subject to change in accordance with the united states’ federal communications commission fcc rules and regulations wireless transceiver products are required to be certified by the fcc and comparable authorities in foreign countries where they are sold garmin’s products sold in europe are required to comply with relevant directives of the european commission a delay in receiving required certifications for new products or enhancements to garmin’s products or losing certification for garmin’s existing products could adversely affect our business in addition aviation products that are intended for installation in “type certificated aircraft” are required to be certified by the faa its european counterpart the european aviation safety agency and other comparable organizations before they can be used in an aircraft

 

because garmin corporation one of the company’s principal subsidiaries is located in taiwan foreign exchange control laws and regulations of taiwan with respect to remittances into and out of taiwan may have an impact on garmin’s operations the taiwan foreign exchange control statute and regulations thereunder provides that all foreign exchange transactions must be executed by banks designated to handle such business by the ministry of finance of taiwan and by the central bank of the republic of china taiwan also referred to as the cbc current regulations favor traderelated foreign exchange transactions consequently foreign currency earned from exports of merchandise and services may now be retained and used freely by exporters while all foreign currency needed for the import of merchandise and services may be purchased freely from the designated foreign exchange banks aside from traderelated foreign exchange transactions taiwan companies and residents may without foreign exchange approval remit outside and into taiwan foreign currencies of up to 50 million and 5 million respectively or their equivalent each calendar year currency conversions within the limits are processed by the designated banks and do not have to be reviewed and approved by the cbc the above limits apply to remittances involving a conversion between new taiwan dollars and us dollars or other foreign currencies the cbc typically approves foreign exchange in excess of the limits if a party applies with the cbc for review and presents legitimate business reasons justifying the currency conversion a requirement is also imposed on all enterprises to register all medium and longterm foreign debt with the cbc

 

environmental matters 

 

garmin’s operations are subject to various environmental laws including laws addressing air and water pollution and management of hazardous substances and wastes substantial noncompliance with applicable environmental laws could have a material adverse effect on our business capital expenditures for environmental controls are included in our normal capital budget

 





 

environmental regulation of garmin’s products is increasing many of garmins products are subject to laws relating to the chemical and material composition of our products and their energy efficiency garmin is also subject to laws requiring manufacturers to be financially responsible for collection recovery and recycling of wastes from certain electronic products compliance with current environmental laws does not have a material impact on our business but the impact of future enactment of environmental laws cannot yet be fully determined and could be substantial

 

garmin has implemented multiple environmental management system ems policies in accordance with the international organization for standardization iso 14001 standard for environmental health and safety management garmin’s ems policies set forth practices standards and procedures to ensure compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations at garmin’s kansas headquarters facility garmin’s european headquarters facility and garmin’s taiwan manufacturing facility

 

regulatory and “green procurement” demands from our customers are also increasing particularly in the areas of restricted substance use and environmentallyfriendly design and manufacture initiatives the overall impacts of these customer requirements cannot yet be established garmin is committed to improving our products and processes to meet our customer needs

 

employees 

  

as of december 27 2014 garmin had 11185 full and parttime employees worldwide of whom 4177 were in the united states 80 were in canada 5276 were in taiwan 1168 were in europe and 484 were in other global locations except for some of garmin’s employees in brazil and sweden none of garmin’s employees are represented by a labor union and none of garmins north american or taiwan employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement garmin considers its employee relations to be good

 




 item 1a risk factors 

  

the risks described below are not the only ones facing our company additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also impair our business operations if any of the following risks occur our business financial condition or operating results could be materially adversely affected 

  

risks related to the company 

  

if we are not successful in the continued development introduction or timely manufacture of new products demand for our products could decrease 

  

we expect that a significant portion of our future revenue will continue to be derived from sales of newly introduced products the market for our products is characterized by rapidly changing technology evolving industry standards and changes in customer needs if we fail to introduce new products or to modify or improve our existing products in response to changes in technology industry standards or customer needs our products could rapidly become less competitive or obsolete we must continue to make significant investments in research and development in order to continue to develop new products enhance existing products and achieve market acceptance for such products however there can be no assurance that development stage products will be successfully completed or if developed will achieve significant customer acceptance

 





 

if we are unable to successfully develop and introduce competitive new products and enhance our existing products our future results of operations would be adversely affected our pursuit of necessary technology may require substantial time and expense we may need to license new technologies to respond to technological change these licenses may not be available to us on terms that we can accept or may materially change the gross profits that we are able to obtain on our products we may not succeed in adapting our products to new technologies as they emerge development and manufacturing schedules for technology products are difficult to predict and there can be no assurance that we will achieve timely initial customer shipments of new products the timely availability of these products in volume and their acceptance by customers are important to our future success any future challenges related to new products whether due to product development delays manufacturing delays lack of market acceptance delays in regulatory approval or otherwise could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations

  

if we are unable to compete effectively with existing or new competitors our resulting loss of competitive position could result in price reductions fewer customer orders reduced margins and loss of market share 

  

the markets for many of our products are highly competitive and we expect competition to increase in the future some of our competitors have significantly greater financial technical and marketing resources than we do these competitors may be able to respond more rapidly to new or emerging technologies or changes in customer requirements they may also be able to devote greater resources to the development promotion and sale of their products or secure better product positioning with retailers increased competition could result in price reductions fewer customer orders reduced margins and loss of market share our failure to compete successfully against current or future competitors could seriously harm our business financial condition and results of operations

  

the demand for personal navigation devices pnds has been and continues to be reduced by replacement technologies becoming available on mobile devices and factoryinstalled systems in new autos as well as by market saturation 

  

gpsnavigation technologies have been incorporated into competing devices such as mobile handsets tablets and new automobiles through factoryinstalled systems many companies are now offering navigation software for these mobile devices the acceptance of this technology by consumers has reduced sales in this segment and has reduced margins in some periods navigation systems are also becoming more prevalent as standard andor optional equipment on new automobiles increased navigation penetration on mobile handsets and in new automobiles is expected to cause further declines in sales of our portable navigation devices and could further reduce margins

 

our financial results are dependent on the automotivemobile segment which represents approximately 43 of our revenues and is expected to decline in 2015 

  

we experienced substantial growth through 2008 in the automotivemobile segment of our business as the products became massmarket consumer electronics in both europe and north america this market is declining as competing technologies emerged and market saturation occurred this has resulted in and could continue to result in periods of lower revenues for this segment and lower earnings per share

 

economic conditions and uncertainty could adversely affect our revenue and margins 

  

our revenue and margins depend significantly on general economic conditions and the demand for products in the markets in which we compete economic weakness or constrained consumer and business spending has resulted in periods of decreased revenue and in the future could result in decreased revenue and problems with our ability to manage inventory levels and collect customer receivables in addition financial difficulties experienced by our retailers and oem customers have resulted and could result in the future in significant bad debt writeoffs and additions to reserves in our receivables and could have an adverse affect on our results of operations

  





 

  

if we do not correctly anticipate demand for our products we may not be able to secure sufficient quantities or costeffective production of our products or we could have costly excess production or inventories 

  

we have generally been able to increase or decrease production to meet fluctuations in demand however the demand for our products depends on many factors and may be difficult to forecast we expect that it will become more difficult to forecast demand as we introduce and support a diverse product portfolio as competition in the market for our products intensifies and as the markets for some of our products mature significant unanticipated fluctuations in demand could cause the following problems in our operations

 

  

  

   

we depend on our suppliers some of which are the sole source for specific components and our production would be seriously harmed if these suppliers are not able to meet our demand and alternative sources are not available or if the costs of components rise 

  

we are dependent on third party suppliers for various components used in our current products some of the components that we procure from third party suppliers include semiconductors and electroluminescent panels liquid crystal displays memory chips batteries and microprocessors the cost quality and availability of components are essential to the successful production and sale of our products some components we use are from sole source suppliers certain applicationspecific integrated circuits incorporating our proprietary designs are manufactured for us by sole source suppliers alternative sources may not be currently available for these sole source components

 

in the past we have experienced shortages of certain components in addition if there are shortages in supply of components the costs of such components may rise if suppliers are unable to meet our demand for components on a timely basis and if we are unable to obtain an alternative source or if the price of the alternative source is prohibitive or if the costs of components rise our ability to maintain timely and costeffective production of our products would be seriously harmed

  

gross margins for our products may fluctuate or erode 

  

gross margins in some of our segments have declined in recent years and could further decline in the future due to competitive price reductions that are not fully offset by material cost reductions in addition our overall gross margin may fluctuate from period to period due to a number of factors including product mix competition and unit volumes in particular the average selling prices of a specific product tend to decrease over that product’s life to offset such decreases we intend to rely primarily on component cost reduction obtaining yield improvements and corresponding cost reductions in the manufacturing of existing products and on introducing new products that incorporate advanced features and therefore can be sold at higher average selling prices however there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain any such yield improvements or cost reductions or introduce any such new products in the future to the extent that such cost reductions and new product introductions do not occur in a timely manner or our products do not achieve market acceptance our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected

 





  

our quarterly financial statements will reflect fluctuations in foreign currency translation 

 

the operation of garmin’s subsidiaries in international markets results in exposure to movements in currency exchange rates we have experienced significant foreign currency gains and losses due to the strengthening and weakening of the us dollar the potential of volatile foreign exchange rate fluctuations in the future could have a significant effect on our results of operations the company has not historically hedged its foreign currency exchange rate risks 

 

the currencies that create a majority of the company’s exchange rate exposure are the taiwan dollar euro and british pound sterling the taiwan dollar is the functional currency of garmin corporation the us dollar remains the functional currency of garmin europe the euro is the functional currency of most european subsidiaries as these entities have grown currency moves can generate material gains and losses additionally eurobased intercompany transactions in garmin ltd can also generate currency gains and losses other legal entities primarily use the local currency as the functional currency due to the relative size of entities using a functional currency other than the taiwan dollar the euro and the british pound sterling currency fluctuations within these entities are not expected to have a material impact on the company’s financial statements

 

the company translates all assets and liabilities at yearend exchange rates and income and expense accounts at average rates during the year us gaap requires the company at the end of each accounting period to translate into functional currency all us dollar denominated assets and liabilities this us gaapmandated translation will cause us to recognize gain or loss on our financial statements as the us dollar strengthens or weakens against the various functional currencies such gain or loss will create variations in our earnings per share because there is minimal cash impact caused by such exchange rate variations management will continue to focus on the company’s operating performance before the impact of the foreign currency translation

 

changes in our united states federal income tax classification or in applicable tax laws could result in adverse tax consequences to our shareholders 

 

legislative proposals have been considered in the united states within the past few years that could increase the united states tax burden of corporations with international operations and could broaden the circumstances under which foreign corporations could be considered resident in the united states legislative proposals are being considered in switzerland that could make significant changes in the corporate tax regime and increase the taxes applicable to us in switzerland our tax position could be adversely impacted by changes in swiss united states or foreign tax laws tax treaties or tax regulations or the interpretation or enforcement thereof by any tax authority we cannot predict the outcome of any specific legislative proposals

 

we do not believe that we or any of our united states or nonunited states subsidiaries are currently a ‘‘passive foreign investment company’’ for united states federal income tax purposes we do not expect to become a passive foreign investment company however because the passive foreign investment company determination is made annually based on whether the company’s income or assets meet certain thresholds as determined under united states federal tax principles which are based on facts and circumstances that may be beyond our control we cannot assure that we will not become a passive foreign investment company in the future if we are a passive foreign investment company in any year then any of our shareholders that is a united states person could be liable to pay tax on their pro rata share of our income plus an interest charge upon some distributions by us or when that shareholder sells our common shares at a gain further if we are classified as a passive foreign investment company in any year in which a united states person is a shareholder we generally will continue to be treated as a passive foreign investment company with respect to such shareholder in all succeeding years regardless of whether we continue to satisfy the income or asset tests mentioned above

 





 

we do not believe that we or any of our united states or nonunited states subsidiaries are currently a controlled foreign corporation cfc for united states federal income tax purposes we do not expect to become a cfc the cfc determination is made daily based on whether the united states shareholders own more than fifty percent of the voting power or value of the company only united states persons that own ten percent or more of the voting power of the company’s shares qualify as united states shareholders if the company were to be classified as a cfc for an uninterrupted thirty day period in any year the company’s shareholders that qualify as united states shareholders could be liable to pay us income tax at ordinary income tax rates on their prorata share of certain categories of the company’s income for the period in which the company is classified as a cfc as the company cannot control the ownership of the company’s stock nor can the company control which shareholders participate in the company’s stock buyback program ownership changes could result that create united states shareholders which increase the risk of garmin being treated as a cfc

 

we have benefited in the past from taiwan government tax incentives offered on certain high technology capital investments that may not always be available 

  

our effective tax rate has historically been lower than the us federal statutory rate in part because we have benefited from incentives offered in taiwan related to our high technology investments in taiwan the loss of these tax benefits has begun to have a negative impact on our effective tax rate and reduced benefits will continue into the future 

 

we may experience unique economic and political risks associated with companies that operate in taiwan 

  

relations between taiwan and the people’s republic of china also referred to as the prc and other factors affecting the political or economic conditions of taiwan in the future could materially affect our business financial condition and results of operations and the market price and the liquidity of our shares our principal manufacturing facilities where we manufacture all of our products except our panelmounted aviation products are located in taiwan

 

taiwan has a unique international political status the prc asserts sovereignty over all of china including taiwan certain other islands and all of mainland china the prc government does not recognize the legitimacy of the taiwan government although significant economic and cultural relations have been established during recent years between taiwan and the prc the prc government has indicated that it may use military force to gain control over taiwan in certain circumstances such as the declaration of independence by taiwan relations between taiwan and the prc have on occasion adversely affected the market value of taiwanese companies and could negatively affect our operations in taiwan in the future

 

our intellectual property rights are important to our operations and we could suffer loss if they infringe upon other’s rights or are infringed upon by others 

  

we rely on a combination of patents copyrights trademarks and trade secrets confidentiality provisions and licensing arrangements to establish and protect our proprietary rights to this end we hold rights to a number of patents and registered trademarks and regularly file applications to attempt to protect our rights in new technology and trademarks however there is no guarantee that our patent applications will become issued patents or that our trademark applications will become registered trademarks moreover even if approved our patents or trademarks may thereafter be successfully challenged by others or otherwise become invalidated for a variety of reasons thus any patents or trademarks we currently have or may later acquire may not provide us a significant competitive advantage

 

third parties may claim that we are infringing their intellectual property rights such claims could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition from time to time we receive letters alleging infringement of patents trademarks or other intellectual property rights litigation concerning patents or other intellectual property is costly and time consuming we may seek licenses from such parties but they could refuse to grant us a license or demand commercially unreasonable terms such infringement claims could also cause us to incur substantial liabilities and to suspend or permanently cease the use of critical technologies or processes or the production or sale of major products

 





 

we may become subject to significant product liability costs 

  

if our aviation products malfunction or contain errors or defects airplane collisions or crashes could occur resulting in property damage personal injury or death malfunctions or errors or defects in our marine navigational products could cause boats to run aground or cause other wreckage personal injury or death if our automotive or marine products contain defects or errors in the mapping supplied by thirdparty map providers or if our users do not heed our warnings about the proper use of these products collisions or accidents could occur resulting in property damage personal injury or death if any of these events occurs we could be subject to significant liability for personal injury and property damage and under certain circumstances could be subject to a judgment for punitive damages we maintain insurance against accidentrelated risks involving our products however there can be no assurance that such insurance would be sufficient to cover the cost of damages to others or that such insurance will continue to be available at commercially reasonable rates in addition insurance coverage generally will not cover awards of punitive damages and may not cover the cost of associated legal fees and defense costs which could result in lower margins if we are unable to maintain sufficient insurance to cover product liability costs or if our insurance coverage does not cover the award this could have a materially adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations

  

privacy concerns relating to our technology could damage our reputation and deter current and potential users from using our products and applications 

 

concerns about our practices with regard to the collection use disclosure or security of personal information user location information or other privacy related matters even if unfounded could damage our reputation and operating results while we strive to comply with all applicable data protection laws and regulations as well as our own posted privacy policies any failure or perceived failure to comply may result in proceedings or actions against us by government entities or others or could cause us to lose users and customers which could potentially have an adverse effect on our business

 

regulatory authorities around the world are considering a number of legislative and regulatory proposals concerning data protection in addition the interpretation and application of consumer and data protection laws in the us europe and elsewhere are often uncertain and in flux it is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our data practices if so in addition to the possibility of fines this could result in an order requiring that we change our data practices which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations complying with these various laws could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business

 

security breaches and other disruptions including as a result of cyber attacks may harm our reputation and adversely affect our business and results of operations 

 

in the ordinary course of our business we electronically maintain sensitive data including intellectual property our proprietary business information and that of our customers and suppliers and some personally identifiable information of our customers and employees in our facilities and on our networks the secure processing maintenance and transmission of this information is important to our operations a breach of our security systems and procedures or those of our vendors could result in significant data losses or theft of our customers or our employees intellectual property proprietary business information or personally identifiable information a cybersecurity breach could negatively affect our reputation as a trusted product and service provider by adversely affecting the markets perception of the security or reliability of our products or services 

 





 

we have a technology and processes in place to detect and respond to data security incidents however because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access disable or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently and may be difficult to detect for long periods of time we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventive measures in addition hardware software or applications we develop or procure from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture or other problems that could unexpectedly compromise information security unauthorized parties may also attempt to gain access to our systems or facilities through fraud trickery or other forms of deceiving our customers and employees accordingly we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate security barriers or other preventative measures or if such measures are implemented and even with appropriate training conducted in support of such measures human errors may still occur it is virtually impossible for us to entirely mitigate this risk a party whether internal or external who is able to circumvent our security measures could misappropriate information

 

actual or anticipated attacks and risks may cause us to incur increasing costs including costs to deploy additional personnel and protection technologies to train employees and to engage third party security experts and consultants our technology errors and omissions insurance may not protect against all of the costs liabilities and other adverse effects arising from a security breach or system failure if we fail to reasonably maintain the security of confidential information we may suffer significant reputational and financial losses and our results of operations cash flows financial condition and liquidity may be adversely affected in addition a system breach could result in other negative consequences including disruption of internal operations and may subject us to private litigation government investigations enforcement actions and cause us to incur potentially significant liability damages or remediation costs

 

we depend on third party licensors for the digital map data contained in our automotivemobile products and our business andor gross margins could be harmed if we become unable to continue licensing such mapping data or if the royalty costs for such data rise 

 

we license digital mapping data for use in our products from various sources there are only a limited number of suppliers of mapping data for each geographical region the two largest digital map suppliers are here formerly known as navteq and tomtom nv here is owned by nokia oyj and tomtom nv is owned by tomtom nv nokia and tomtom are both competitors of garmin

 

although we do not foresee difficulty in continuing to license data at favorable pricing due to the long term license extension signed between garmin and here in february 2015 extending our here license agreement through 2024 if we are unable to continue licensing such mapping data and are unable to obtain an alternative source or if the nature of our relationships with here changes detrimentally our ability to supply mapping data for use in our products would be seriously harmed

  

we may have additional income tax liabilities 

  

we are subject to income taxes in switzerland the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes in the ordinary course of our business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain we are regularly under audit by tax authorities although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals the results of an audit or litigation could have a material effect on our income tax provision net income or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made

 

failure to obtain required certifications of our products on a timely basis could harm our business 

  

we have certain products especially in our aviation segment that are subject to governmental and similar certifications before they can be sold for example faa certification is required for all of our aviation products that are intended for installation in typecertificated aircraft to the extent required certification is an expensive and timeconsuming process that requires significant focus and resources an inability to obtain or excessive delay in obtaining such certifications could have an adverse effect on our ability to introduce new products and for certain aviation oem products our customers’ ability to sell airplanes delays in our obtaining certification for our aviation products have resulted and may in the future result in our being required to pay compensation to our customers therefore such inabilities or delays could adversely affect our operating results in addition we cannot assure you that our certified products will not be decertified any such decertification could have an adverse effect on our operating results

 





 

our business may suffer if we are not able to hire and retain sufficient qualified personnel or if we lose our key personnel 

  

our future success depends partly on the continued contribution of our key executive engineering sales marketing manufacturing and administrative personnel we currently do not have employment agreements with any of our key executive officers swiss law prohibits us from paying severance payments to our senior executive officers which may impair our ability to recruit for these positions we do not have key man life insurance on any of our key executive officers and do not currently intend to obtain such insurance the loss of the services of any of our senior level management or other key employees could harm our business recruiting and retaining the skilled personnel we require to maintain and grow our market position may be difficult for example in some recent years there has been a nationwide shortage of qualified engineers who are necessary for us to design and develop new products and therefore it has sometimes been challenging to recruit such personnel if we fail to hire and retain qualified employees we may not be able to maintain and expand our business

 

our quarterly operating results are subject to fluctuations and seasonality 

  

our operating results are difficult to predict our future quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly if such operating results decline the price of our stock could decline as we have expanded our operations our operating expenses particularly our research and development costs have increased as a percentage of our sales if revenues decrease and we continue to increase research and development costs our operating results would be negatively affected

 

historically our revenues have been weaker in the first quarter of each fiscal year as our devices are highly consumeroriented and consumer buying is traditionally lower in this quarter sales of certain of our fitness marine and automotive products tend to be higher in our second fiscal quarter due to increased consumer spending for such products in the spring season and travel season sales of many of our consumer products also have been higher in our fourth fiscal quarter due to increased consumer spending patterns on electronic devices during the holiday season in addition we attempt to time our new product releases to coincide with relatively higher consumer spending in the second and fourth fiscal quarters which contributes to these seasonal variations

  

we rely on independent dealers and distributors to sell our products and disruption to these channels would harm our business 

  

because we sell many of our products to independent dealers and distributors we are subject to many risks including risks related to their inventory levels and support for our products in particular our dealers and distributors maintain significant levels of our products in their inventories if dealers and distributors attempt to reduce their levels of inventory or if they do not maintain sufficient levels to meet customer demand our sales could be negatively impacted

 

many of our dealers and distributors also sell products offered by our competitors if our competitors offer our dealers and distributors more favorable terms those dealers and distributors may deemphasize or decline to carry our products in the future we may not be able to retain or attract a sufficient number of qualified dealers and distributors if we are unable to maintain successful relationships with dealers and distributors or to expand our distribution channels our business will suffer

  

we may pursue strategic acquisitions investments strategic partnerships or other ventures and our business could be materially harmed if we fail to successfully identify complete and integrate such transactions 

  

we intend to evaluate acquisition opportunities and opportunities to make investments in complementary businesses technologies services or products or to enter into strategic partnerships with parties who can provide access to those assets additional product or services offerings additional distribution or marketing synergies or additional industry expertise we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition investment or strategic partnership candidates or if we do identify suitable candidates in the future we may not be able to complete those transactions on commercially favorable terms or at all

 





 

any past or future acquisitions could also result in difficulties assimilating acquired employees operations and products and diversion of capital and management’s attention away from other business issues and opportunities integration of acquired companies may result in problems related to integration of technology and inexperienced management teams in addition the key personnel of the acquired company may decide not to work for us we may not successfully integrate internal controls compliance under the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 and other corporate governance matters operations personnel or products related to acquisitions we have made in previous years or may make in the future if we fail to successfully integrate such transactions our business could be materially harmed

 

there is uncertainty as to our shareholders’ ability to enforce certain foreign civil liabilities in switzerland and taiwan 

  

we are a swiss company and a substantial portion of our assets are located outside the united states particularly in taiwan as a result it may be difficult to effect service of process within the united states upon us in addition there is uncertainty as to whether the courts of switzerland or taiwan would recognize or enforce judgments of united states courts obtained against us predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the united states or any state thereof or be competent to hear original actions brought in switzerland or taiwan against us predicated upon the securities laws of the united states or any state thereof

 

a shut down of federal aviation administration operations would harm our business 

  

any failure of congress to appropriate funds for faa operations that results in any shut down of faa operations or furloughing of faa employees could result in delays in the required faa certification of our avionics products and in the production sale and registration of aircraft that use our avionics products such delays could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results

 

many of our products rely on the global positioning system 

  

the global positioning system gps is a satellitebased navigation and positioning system consisting of a constellation of orbiting satellites the satellites and their ground control and monitoring stations are maintained and operated by the united states department of defense the department of defense does not currently charge users for access to the satellite signals these satellites and their ground support systems are complex electronic systems subject to electronic and mechanical failures and possible sabotage the satellites were originally designed to have lives of 75 years and are subject to damage by the hostile space environment in which they operate however of the current deployment of satellites in place some have been operating for more than 20 years

 

to repair damaged or malfunctioning satellites is currently not economically feasible if a significant number of satellites were to become inoperable there could be a substantial delay before they are replaced with new satellites a reduction in the number of operating satellites may impair the current utility of the gps system and the growth of current and additional market opportunities gps satellites and ground control segments are being modernized gps modernization software updates can cause problems we depend on public access to open technical specifications in advance of gps updates

 

gps is operated by the u s government which is committed to maintenance and improvement of gps however if the policy were to change and gps were no longer supported by the u s government or if user fees were imposed it could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition

 





 

some of our products also use signals from satellite based augmentation systems sbas that augment gps such as the us wide area augmentation system waas japanese mtsatbased satellite augmentation system msas and european geostationary navigation overlay service egnos any curtailment of sbas operating capability could result in decreased user capability for many of our aviation products thereby impacting our markets

 

any of the foregoing factors could affect the willingness of buyers of our products to select global positioning systembased products instead of products based on competing technologies

 

our business is subject to disruptions and uncertainties caused by geopolitical instability war or terrorism 

 

acts of war or acts of terrorism especially any directed at the gps signals could have a material adverse impact on our business operating results and financial condition the threat of terrorism and war and heightened security and military response to this threat or any future acts of terrorism may cause a redeployment of the satellites used in gps or interruptions of the system to the extent that such interruptions have an effect on sales of our products this could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition

  

a shut down of airspace or imposition of restrictions on general aviation would harm our business the shutdown of airspace could cause reduced sales of our general aviation products and delays in the shipment of our products manufactured in our taiwan manufacturing facilities to our global distribution facilities thereby adversely affecting our ability to supply new and existing products to our dealers and distributors

 

any reallocation or repurposing of radio frequency spectrum could cause harmful interference with the reception of global positioning system signals this interference could harm our business 

  

our global positioning system technology is dependent on the use of the standard positioning service sps provided by the us government’s global positioning system satellites the global positioning system operates in radio frequency bands that are globally allocated for radio navigation satellite services international allocations of radio frequency are made by the international telecommunications union itu a specialized technical agency of the united nations these allocations are further governed by radio regulations that have treaty status and which may be subject to modification every two to three years by the world radio communication conference each country also has regulatory authority on how each band is used in the united states the federal communications commission fcc and the national telecommunications and information administration ntia share responsibility for radio frequency allocations and spectrum usage regulations

 

any itu or national reallocation of radio frequency spectrum including frequency band segmentation or sharing of spectrum or other modifications of the permitted uses of relevant frequency bands may materially and adversely affect the utility and reliability of our products and have significant negative impacts on our business and our customers

  

we may be exposed to certain regulatory and financial risks related to climate change 

 

climate change is receiving increasing attention worldwide some scientists legislators and others attribute global warming to increased levels of greenhouse gases including carbon dioxide which has led to significant legislative and regulatory efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions

 

various regulatory and legislative measures to address greenhouse gas emissions are in different phases of implementation or discussion in the aftermath of its 2009 “endangerment finding” that greenhouse gas emissions pose a threat to human health and welfare the environmental protection agency has begun to regulate greenhouse gas emissions under the authority granted to it under the clean air act at the federal legislative level congressional passage of legislation adopting some form of federal mandatory greenhouse gas emission reduction such as a nationwide capandtrade program does not appear likely at this time although it could be adopted at a future date it is also possible that congress may pass alternative climate change bills that do not mandate a nationwide capandtrade program and instead focus on promoting renewable energy and energy efficiency which could increase the cost of doing business 

 





 

because it is uncertain what laws and regulations will be enacted we cannot predict the potential impact of such laws and regulations on our future consolidated financial condition results of operations or cash flows

 

risks relating to our shares 

  

the volatility of our stock price could adversely affect investment in our common shares 

 

the market price of our common shares has been and may continue to be highly volatile during 2014 the closing price of our common shares ranged from a low of 4363 to a high of 6169 a variety of factors could cause the price of our common shares to fluctuate perhaps substantially including

 

              

in addition in recent years the stock market in general and the markets for shares of technology companies in particular have experienced extreme price fluctuations which have often been unrelated to the operating performance of affected companies any such fluctuations in the future could adversely affect the market price of our common shares

  

our officers and directors exert substantial influence over us 

  

as of january 25 2015 current members and former members of our board of directors and our executive officers together with members of their families and entities that may be deemed affiliates of or related to such persons or entities beneficially owned approximately 4062 of our outstanding common shares accordingly these shareholders may be able to determine the outcome of corporate actions requiring shareholder approval such as mergers and acquisitions and shareholder proposals this level of ownership may have a significant effect in delaying deferring or preventing a change in control of garmin and may adversely affect the voting and other rights of other holders of our common shares

 





 

the rights of our shareholders are governed by swiss law 

 

  the rights of our shareholders are governed by swiss law and garmin ltd’s articles of association the rights of shareholders under swiss law differ from the rights of shareholders of companies incorporated in other jurisdictions for example swiss law allows our shareholders acting at a shareholders’ meeting to authorize share capital that can be issued by the board of directors without approval of a shareholders’ meeting but this authorization is limited to 50 of the existing registered share capital and must be renewed at a shareholders’ meeting at least every two years for it to continue to be available additionally subject to specified exceptions including the exceptions described in our articles of association swiss law grants preemptive rights to existing shareholders to subscribe for new issuances of shares and other securities swiss law also does not provide as much flexibility in the various terms that can attach to different classes of shares as the laws of some other jurisdictions swiss law also reserves for approval by shareholders certain corporate actions over which a board of directors would have authority in some other jurisdictions for example swiss law provides that dividends and other distributions must be approved by shareholders at the general meeting of shareholders these swiss law requirements relating to our capital management may limit our flexibility and situations may arise where greater flexibility would have provided substantial benefits to our shareholders

 

we may not be able to make distributions or repurchase shares without subjecting you to swiss withholding tax 

 

  if we are unable to make distributions if any through a reduction of par value or to pay dividends if any out of qualifying capital contribution reserves then any dividends paid by us will generally be subject to a swiss federal withholding tax at a rate of 35 the withholding tax must be withheld from the gross distribution and paid to the swiss federal tax administration a us holder that qualifies for benefits under the convention between the united states of america and the swiss confederation for the avoidance of double taxation with respect to taxes on income may apply for a refund of the tax withheld in excess of the 15 treaty rate or in excess of the 5 reduced treaty rate for qualifying corporate shareholders with at least 10 participation in our voting stock or for a full refund in case of qualified pension funds payment of a capital distribution in the form of a par value reduction or a dividend out of qualifying capital contribution reserves is not subject to swiss withholding tax however there can be no assurance that our shareholders will approve a reduction in par value or a dividend out of qualifying capital contribution reserves that we will be able to meet the other legal requirements for a reduction in par value or that swiss withholding rules will not be changed in the future or that a change in swiss law will not adversely affect us or our shareholders in particular as a result of distributions out of qualifying capital contribution reserves becoming subject to additional corporate law or other restrictions there are currently legislative projects pending in swiss parliament and the swiss federal administration that – depending on their final form – may limit the distribution of qualifying capital contribution reserves in addition over the long term the amount of par value and qualifying capital contribution reserves available for us to use for par value reductions or dividends will be limited if we are unable to make a distribution through a reduction in par value or to pay a dividend out of qualifying capital contribution reserves we may not be able to make distributions without subjecting you to swiss withholding taxes

 

under current swiss tax law repurchases of shares for the purposes of capital reduction are treated as a partial liquidation subject to 35 swiss withholding tax on the difference between the par value and the repurchase price however the portion of the repurchase price that is attributed to qualifying capital contribution reserves of the shares repurchased will not be subject to the swiss withholding tax no partial liquidation treatment applies and no withholding tax is triggered if the shares are not repurchased for cancellation but held by us as treasury shares however should we not resell such treasury shares within six years the withholding tax becomes due at the end of the six year period

 

we may follow a share repurchase process for future share repurchases if any similar to a second trading line on the six swiss exchange in which swiss institutional investors buy shares on the open market and sell these shares to us and are generally able to receive a refund of the swiss withholding tax however if we are unable to use this process successfully we may not be able to repurchase shares for the purposes of capital reduction without subjecting you to swiss withholding taxes if and to the extent that the repurchase of shares is made out of retained earnings or other taxable reserves no withholding tax would be applicable if and to the extent that qualifying capital contribution reserves are attributable to the share repurchase

overview 

 

we are a leading worldwide provider of navigation communications and information devices most of which are enabled by global positioning system or gps technology we operate in five business segments which serve the marine outdoor fitness automotivemobile and aviation markets our segments offer products through our network of subsidiary distributors and independent dealers and distributors however the nature of products and types of customers for the five segments can vary significantly as such the segments are managed separately

 

since our first products were delivered in 1991 we have generated positive income from operations each year and have funded our growth from these profits

 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

  

general 

 

garmin’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon garmin’s consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the presentation of these financial statements requires garmin to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis garmin evaluates its estimates including those related to customer sales programs and incentives product returns bad debts inventories investments intangible assets income taxes warranty obligations and contingencies and litigation garmin bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions

 





 

for information on each of the following critical accounting policies andor estimates refer to the discussion in the notes to the consolidated financial statements as indicated in the table below

 

  

accounting terms and characteristics 

  

net sales 

 

our net sales are primarily generated through sales to our retail partners dealer and distributor network and to original equipment manufacturers refer to the revenue recognition discussion in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements our sales are largely of a consumer nature therefore backlog levels are not necessarily indicative of our future sales results we aim to achieve a quick turnaround on orders we receive and we typically ship most orders within 72 hours

 

net sales are subject to seasonal fluctuation typically sales of our consumer products are highest in the second quarter due to increased demand during the spring and summer season and in the fourth quarter due to increased demand during the holiday buying season our aviation products do not experience much seasonal variation but are more influenced by the timing of aircraft certifications and the release of new products when the initial demand is typically the strongest

 

cost of salesgross profit 

 

raw material costs are our most significant component of cost of goods sold our existing practice of performing the design and manufacture of our products inhouse has enabled us to source components from different suppliers and where possible to redesign our products to leverage lower cost components we believe that our flexible production model allows our xizhi jhongli and linkou manufacturing plants in taiwan our olathe kansas and salem oregon manufacturing plants to experience relatively low costs of manufacturing in general products manufactured in taiwan have been our highest volume products our manufacturing labor costs historically have been lower in taiwan than in olathe and salem

 

sales price variability has had and can be expected to have an effect on our gross profit in the past prices of our devices sold into the automotivemobile market have declined due to market pressures and introduction of new products sold at lower price points in recent years pricing has stabilized in automotivemobile allowing for stable to improving gross margins the average selling prices of our aviation outdoor fitness and marine products have historically been stable due to product mix and the introduction of more advanced products sold at higher prices in 2014 fitness pricing declined due to high volumes of lowerpriced activity trackers the effect of the sales price differences inherent within the mix of products sold could have a significant impact on our gross profit

  





  

advertising expense 

  

our advertising expenses consist of costs for media advertising cooperative advertising with our retail partners point of sale displays and sponsorships

  

selling general and administrative expenses 

 

our selling general and administrative expenses consist primarily of

 

        

research and development 

 

the majority of our research and development costs represent salaries for our engineers costs for high technology components and costs of test equipment used in product and prototype development approximately 82 of the research and development of our products is performed in north america

 

we are committed to increasing the level of innovative design and development of new products as we strive for expanded ability to serve our existing consumer and aviation markets as well as new markets for active lifestyle products

 

income taxes 

 

we have experienced a relatively low effective corporate tax rate due to the proportion of our revenue generated by entities in tax jurisdictions with low statutory rates in particular the profit entitlement afforded our swissbased companies based on their intellectual property rights ownership of our consumer products along with tax incentives offered by the taiwanese government on certain hightechnology capital investments have continued to reduce our tax rate we have taken advantage of the tax benefit in taiwan since our inception and we expect to continue to benefit from lower effective tax rates at least through 2015

  





  

results of operations 

  

the following table sets forth our results of operations as a percentage of net sales during the periods shown the table may not foot due to rounding

 

  

the following table sets forth our results of operations through income before income taxes for each of our five segments during the period shown for each line item in the table the total of the segments’ amounts equals the amount in the consolidated statements of income data included in item 6

 





 

  

  

  





  

comparison of 52weeks ended december 27 2014 and december 28 2013 

 

net sales 

 

  

net sales increased 9 in 2014 when compared to the yearago period all segments excluding automotivemobile grew in the fiscal year 2014 automotivemobile revenue remains the largest portion of our revenue mix at 43 in the fiscal year 2014 compared to 49 in the fiscal year 2013

 

total unit sales increased 9 to 151 million units in 2014 from 139 million units in 2013 the increase in unit sales volume was attributable to growth in all segments except automotivemobile which had volume decline due to penetration rates and competing technologies

 

automotivemobile segment revenue decreased 5 from fiscal year 2013 as a 10 volume decline and slight average selling price asp decline were partially offset by amortization of previously deferred revenue exceeding current period revenue deferrals and increased auto oem contributions revenues in our fitness segment increased 60 from fiscal year 2013 on the strength of wellness products first introduced in 2014 and recent biking and running product introductions aviation revenues increased 14 from fiscal year 2013 as both oem market share gains and aftermarket strength contributed to growth outdoor revenues increased 4 from fiscal year 2013 primarily due to strong sales of fēnix 2 and our lineup of dog tracking and training products offset by declining sales of our handheld products which serve a mature industry revenues in our marine segment increased 11 due to both the recent acquisition of fusion electronics as well as new product introductions this growth was partially offset by a competitive pricing environment in the global marine electronics industry

 

the company anticipates revenue of 29 billion in 2015 driven by growth in the fitness aviation and marine segments offset by ongoing declines in the automotivemobile segment in general management believes that continuous innovation and the introduction of new products are essential for future revenue growth

 

cost of goods sold 

  

  

cost of goods sold increased 3 in absolute dollars for fiscal year 2014 when compared to fiscal year 2013 the increase was driven by growth in all segments excluding automotivemobile fitness and marine cost of goods increased inline with sales growth as described above with gross margins stable yearoveryear outdoor cost of goods increased due to sales growth with gross margin contraction driven by product mix

 





 

as a percentage of revenue cost of goods sold decreased 240 basis points from fiscal year 2013 with improvement or stability in each segment excluding outdoor as mentioned above the automotivemobile cost of goods improvement as a percent of revenues was primarily due to benefit from the amortization of previously deferred revenue and costs exceeding new deferrals on current period sales in 2014 aviation margin improvement was primarily due to increased contribution of software sales which carry a higher margin

 

management believes that cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales will be relatively stable in 2015 given the growth in segments with higher margin profiles than corporate average product mix within those segments and current component pricing

 

gross profit 

 

  

gross profit dollars in fiscal year 2014 increased 14 while gross profit margin increased 240 basis points compared to fiscal year 2013 with all segments stable or improving excluding outdoor the automotivemobile fitness marine and aviation segments recorded improved gross margins as discussed above outdoor gross profit margins declined as discussed above

  

management believes that total company gross margins will be relatively stable in 2015 as discussed above 

  

advertising expenses 

 

  

advertising expense increased 30 in absolute dollars while increasing 80 basis points as a percent of revenues the increase in absolute dollars occurred primarily in outdoor and fitness to support new product introductions and was partially offset by decreased spending in automotivemobile due to reduced cooperative advertising associated with lower volumes aviation advertising increased materially due to increased cooperative advertising efforts with our dealers

 

management expects to decrease advertising as a percentage of sales in 2015 due to continued benefit from the 2014 advertising increase

 





  

selling general and administrative expenses 

 

  

selling general and administrative expense increased 5 in absolute dollars and declined 50 basis points as a percent of revenues compared to fiscal year 2013 the absolute dollar increase is primarily related to product support information technology costs and legal costs specific to marine litigation the aviation increase was primarily driven by product support costs other variances by segment excluding aviation are primarily due to the allocation of certain selling general and administrative expenses based on percentage of total revenues

 

management expects selling general and administrative expenses to increase slightly as a percentage of sales in 2015

  

research and development expense 

 

  

research and development expense increased 8 due to ongoing development activities for new products and the addition of over 200 new engineering personnel to our staff since the fiscal year 2013 in absolute dollars research and development costs increased 302 million when compared with fiscal year 2013 and decreased 10 basis points as a percent of revenue fitness outdoor and aviation increased to support new product initiatives automotivemobile investment declined due to efforts to allocate research and development spending to areas with the highest growth potential

 

management believes that one of the key strategic initiatives for future growth and success of garmin is continuous innovation development and introduction of new products management expects that its research and development expenses will increase during fiscal 2015 on an absolute dollar basis and as a percent of revenue in order to deliver innovative new products and technologies

  





  

operating income 

 

   

as a result of the above operating income increased 20 in absolute dollars and 220 basis points as a percent of revenue when compared to the fiscal year 2013 revenue growth and an improving gross margin percentage as discussed above contributed to the growth by segment results are discussed above

  

other income expense 

 

  

the average return on cash and investments during the fiscal years of 2014 and 2013 were 13 and 14 respectively the slight increase in interest income was offset by fewer capital gains on investments in 2014 which is recorded as other income

 

foreign currency gains and losses for the company are primarily tied to movements by the taiwan dollar the euro and the british pound sterling in relation to the us dollar the taiwan dollar is the functional currency of garmin corporation the us dollar remains the functional currency of garmin europe ltd the euro is the functional currency of most european subsidiaries as these entities have grown currency fluctuations can generate material gains and losses additionally eurobased intercompany transactions can also generate currency gains and losses due to the relative size of the entities using a functional currency other than the taiwan dollar the euro and the british pound sterling currency fluctuations related to these entities are not expected to have a material impact on the company’s financial statements

 

the majority of the 43 million currency loss in the fiscal year 2014 was due to the strengthening of the us dollar compared to the euro and the british pound sterling the strengthening of the us dollar compared to the taiwan dollar contributed an offsetting gain the movements of the taiwan dollar and eurobritish pound sterling have offsetting impacts when the currencies move congruently against the us dollar due to the use of the taiwan dollar for manufacturing costs and cash held in nonfunctional currency while the euro and british pound sterling transactions relate primarily to revenue during fiscal year 2014 the us dollar strengthened 114 compared to the euro and 55 compared to the british pound sterling resulting in a net loss of 437 million this was more than offset as the us dollar strengthened 55 compared to the taiwan dollar resulting in a gain of 448 million the remaining net currency loss of 54 million is related to other currencies and timing of transactions

 

the majority of the 355 million currency gain in 2013 was due to the strengthening of the us dollar compared to the taiwan dollar the weakening of the us dollar compared to the euro and british pound sterling contributed additional gains during 2013 the us dollar weakened 41 and 22 respectively relative to the euro and british pound sterling resulting in a foreign currency gain of 75 million in garmin ltd and our european subsidiaries the us dollar strengthened 33 against the taiwan dollar resulting in a 302 million foreign currency gain due to the fluctuation of asset balances throughout the year the net result of these currency moves combined with other losses of 21 million and the timing of transactions during the year was a net gain of 355 million for the company

 





  

income tax provision 

  

our income tax expense increased by 3184 million to 3595 million for the fiscal year 2014 from 411 million for the fiscal year 2013 contributing to the significant increase were

 

    

partially offset by favorable impacts including

 

  

in the third quarter of 2014 the company initiated an intercompany restructuring that realigned our corporate entity structure this change in corporate structure provides access to historical earnings that were previously permanently reinvested and allows us to efficiently repatriate future earnings as a result of the change in corporate structure garmin recorded tax expense of 307635   the first cash tax payment of 78137 associated with the restructuring was made in the third quarter of 2014 we anticipate paying approximately 185000 in the second quarter of 2015 the remainder of the accrued tax will be paid incrementally as the cash is repatriated 

 

the company expects the effective income tax rate to be between 1617 in 2015

  

net income loss 

 

as a result of the various factors noted above net income decreased 41 to 3642 million for the fiscal year 2014 compared to 6124 million for fiscal year 2013

  

comparison of 52weeks ended december 28 2013 and december 29 2012 

 

net sales 

 

  

net sales decreased 3 in 2013 when compared to the yearago period the decrease was driven by the automotivemobile segment which posted a 13 decline with offsetting growth in outdoor fitness marine and aviation automotivemobile revenue remains the largest portion of our revenue mix at 49 in 2013 compared to 55 in 2012

 





 

total unit sales decreased 10 to 139 million units in 2013 from 154 million units in 2012 the decrease in unit sales volume was attributable to reduced automotivemobile volumes due to penetration rates and competing technologies this decline was partially offset by growth in each of the other segments

 

automotivemobile segment revenue decreased 13 from the yearago period as volumes decreased 17 partially offset by average selling price asp improvement due to the amortization of previously deferred revenue exceeding current year revenue deferrals in 2013 and increased auto oem contribution with a higher asp

 

aviation revenues increased 16 from the yearago period as the oem market improved in some aircraft categories as well as contribution from recent share gains and aftermarket products fitness revenues increased 11 on the strength of our cycling products power meter and the forerunner 10 with strong volume growth partially offset by reduced asps associated with the forerunner 10 revenues in our marine segment increased 7 as new product introductions were partially offset by a weak first quarter when we discounted many products in advance of new products and a global marine electronics industry that continues to be weak due to macroeconomic instability

 

cost of goods sold 

  

  

cost of goods sold decreased 4 when compared to the year ago period as a percentage of revenue cost of goods sold decreased 50 basis points from the year ago period cost of goods as a percentage of revenue for outdoor and fitness were negatively impacted by product mix and slight asp declines cost of goods as a percentage of revenues increased by 850 basis points in marine due to significant pricing discounts on legacy inventory in the first half of 2013 competitive pricing dynamics on new products and rising component costs the automotivemobile segment recorded a 13 decline in cost of goods in absolute dollars as revenues declined 13 cost of goods as a percentage of revenues for the automotivemobile segment decreased by 30 basis points as the effect of a 21 million onetime royalty fee benefit related to license fee overpayments recorded in the second quarter of 2012 was offset by the benefit from the amortization of previously deferred high margin revenue and the associated costs exceeding new deferrals on current period sales in 2013 the aviation segment experienced an absolute dollar cost of goods sold increase generally commensurate with the sales increase discussed above

 

gross profit 

 

  

gross profit dollars in 2013 decreased 2 while gross profit margin increased 50 basis points compared to 2012 driven primarily by the automotivemobile and aviation segments the automotivemobile gross margin was stable at 43 as the royalty benefit recorded in the second quarter of 2012 was offset by increased amortization of previously deferred high margin revenues in 2013 as discussed above the gross profit margin percentage for the marine segment declined by 850 basis points as discussed above





    

advertising expenses 

 

  

advertising expense decreased 19 in absolute dollars and 80 basis points as a percent of revenue compared to the yearago period the decrease occurred primarily in the automotivemobile and marine segments due to reduced cooperative advertising associated with lower volumes in automotivemobile and a newer product line in marine requiring less promotional activity

 

selling general and administrative expenses 

 

  

selling general and administrative expense decreased 4 in absolute dollars and 10 basis points as a percent of revenues compared to the yearago period the absolute dollar decrease is primarily related to reduced legal settlements and legal fees in the automotivemobile segment the increase in aviation is partially related to an increase in bad debt expense variances by segment are primarily due to the allocation of certain selling general and administrative expenses based on percentage of total revenues

  

research and development expense 

 

  

research and development expense increased 12 due to ongoing development activities for new products and the addition of over 200 new engineering personnel to our staff since 2012 in absolute dollars research and development costs increased 392 million when compared with 2012 representing a 190 basis point increase as a percent of revenue aviation had the largest increase in absolute dollars as we are investing heavily in oem opportunities marine and automotivemobile investment is focused on marine product enhancements and automotive oem opportunities respectively within outdoor and fitness we launched a number of new product categories in 2013 we are also exploring new categories within these segments

 





    

operating income 

 

   

operating income decreased 5 in absolute dollars and 40 basis points as a percent of revenue when compared to 2012 due to declining revenues and increased research and development expense offset by a slight improvement in gross margins and cost reductions in advertising and selling general and administrative expenses as discussed above

  

other income expense 

 

  

other income expense principally consists of interest income and foreign currency exchange gains and losses interest income for fiscal 2013 increased slightly due to increasing cash and marketable securities balances during the year

 

the majority of the 355 million currency gain in 2013 was due to the strengthening of the us dollar compared to the taiwan dollar the weakening of the us dollar compared to the euro and british pound sterling contributed additional gains the movements of the taiwan dollar and eurobritish pound sterling have offsetting impacts due to the use of the taiwan dollar for manufacturing costs and cash held in nonfunctional currency while the euro and british pound sterling transactions relate to revenue during 2013 the us dollar weakened 41 and 22 respectively relative to the euro and british pound sterling resulting in a foreign currency gain of 75 million in garmin ltd and our european subsidiaries the us dollar strengthened 33 against the taiwan dollar resulting in a 302 million foreign currency gain due to the fluctuation of asset balances throughout the year the net result of these currency moves combined with other losses of 21 million and the timing of transactions during the year was a net gain of 355 million for the company

 

the 200 million currency loss in 2012 was due primarily to weakening of the us dollar compared to the taiwan dollar during 2012 the us dollar weakened 38 compared to the taiwan dollar resulting in a loss of 313 million this was partially offset by the us dollar weakening 21 and 43 respectively compared to the euro and the british pound sterling resulting in a 104 million gain the remaining net currency gain of 08 million is related to other currencies and timing of transactions

  

income tax provision 

  

our income tax expense decreased by 410 million to 411 million for the fiscal year 2013 from 821 million for the fiscal year 2012 contributing to the significant decrease were

 





 

·   release of uncertain tax position reserves due to expiration of certain statutes of limitations or completion of tax audits of 799 million in fiscal year 2013 compared to releases of 130 million in fiscal year 2012 and 

·   research and development tax credits of 63 million related to 2012 which were recognized when the related legislation was enacted in january 2013 

 

partially offset by unfavorable impacts including

 

·   unfavorable income mix across tax jurisdictions and 

·   expiration of certain taiwan tax holidays 

  

net income 

 

as a result of the various factors noted above net income increased 13 to 6124 million for fiscal year 2013 compared to 5424 million for fiscal year 2012

 

liquidity and capital resources 

 

operating activities 

  

the 1074 million decrease in cash provided by operating activities in fiscal year 2014 compared to fiscal year 2013 was primarily due to the following

 

     

partially offset by

 

   





 

    

the 547 million decrease in cash provided by operating activities in fiscal year 2013 compared to fiscal year 2012 was primarily due to the following

 

       

partially offset by

 

     

we expect to generate 610 million of cash flow from operations in 2015 with ongoing net income

 

investing activities 

 

 

  

the 4058 million increase in cash provided by investing activities in fiscal year 2014 compared to fiscal year 2013 was primarily due to the following

 





 

   

partially offset by

 

    

the 2218 million decrease in cash used in investing activities in fiscal year 2013 compared to fiscal year 2012 was primarily due to the following

 

  

partially offset by

 

   

we have budgeted approximately 85 million of capital expenditures during fiscal 2015 to include some facility expansion along with normal ongoing capital expenditures and maintenance activities it is management’s goal to invest the onhand cash consistent with garmin’s investment policy which has been approved by the board of directors the investment policy’s primary purpose is to preserve capital maintain an acceptable degree of liquidity and maximize yield within the constraint of low credit risk garmin’s average return on cash and investments during fiscal 2014 2013 and 2012 were approximately 13 14 and 14 respectively

 

the fair value of our securities varies from period to period due to changes in interest rates in the performance of the underlying collateral and in the credit performance of the underlying issuer among other factors in 2013 garmin experienced unrealized noncash losses on its investment portfolio resulting in a balance of 57356 and 4377 of gross otherthantemporary impairment and other unrealized losses on marketable securities at december 28 2013 the amortized cost and estimated fair value of the securities at an unrealized loss position at december 28 2013 were 1215498 and 1153765 respectively this decrease in estimated fair value was primarily due to market valuations on mortgagebacked securities and obligations of states and political subdivisions declining the decline was due to increases in the 10 year treasury bond yield during 2013 which caused market valuations of securities in our investment portfolios to decline 

 

the 10 year treasury bond yield decreased in 2014 resulting in a balance of 13031 and 8420 of gross otherthantemporary impairment and other unrealized losses on marketable securities at december 27 2014 the amortized cost and estimated fair value of the securities at an unrealized loss position at december 27 2014 were 1276404 and 1254953 respectively approximately 59 of securities in our portfolio were at an unrealized loss position at december 27 2014 we have the ability to hold these securities until maturity or their value is recovered we do not consider these unrealized losses to be other than temporary credit losses because there has been no deterioration in credit quality and no change in the cash flows of the underlying securities we do not intend to sell the securities and it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the securities therefore no impairment has been recorded in the accompanying condensed consolidated statement of income

 





 

financing activities 

 

  

the 1928 million increase in cash used in financing activities in fiscal year 2014 compared to fiscal year 2013 was primarily due to the following

 

   

the 1570 million increase in cash used in financing activities in fiscal year 2013 compared to fiscal year 2012 was primarily due to the following

 

   

our dividend has progressively increased from 040 per share for the four calendar quarters beginning in june 2011 to 045 per share for the eight calendar quarters beginning in june 2012 to 048 per share for the four calendar quarters beginning in june 2014

  

we currently use cash flow from operations to fund our capital expenditures to support our working capital requirements and to pay dividends we expect that future cash requirements will principally be for capital expenditures working capital payment of dividends declared share repurchases and the funding of strategic acquisitions we believe that our existing cash balances and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our longterm projected capital expenditures working capital and other cash requirements

  

contractual obligations and commercial commitments 

 

future commitments of garmin as of december 27 2014 aggregated by type of contractual obligation are

 

  

the company is a party to certain commitments which includes raw materials advertising and other indirect purchases in connection with conducting our business pursuant to these agreements the company is contractually committed to make purchases of approximately 2681 million over the next five years

 

we may be required to make significant cash outlays related to unrecognized tax benefits however due to the uncertainty of the timing of future cash flows associated with our unrecognized tax benefits we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement if any with the respective taxing authorities accordingly unrecognized tax benefits of 775 million as of december 27 2014 have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above for further information related to unrecognized tax benefits see note 2 “income taxes” to the consolidated financial statements included in this report

  





  

offbalance sheet arrangements 

 

we do not have any offbalance sheet arrangements

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

market sensitivity 

 

we have market risk primarily in connection with the pricing of our products and services and the purchase of raw materials product pricing and raw materials costs are both significantly influenced by semiconductor market conditions historically during cyclical industry downturns we have been able to offset pricing declines for our products through a combination of improved product mix and success in obtaining price reductions in raw materials costs

  

inflation 

 

we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our business financial condition or results of operations if our costs were to become subject to significant inflationary pressures we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs through price increases our inability or failure to do so could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations

 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

 

the operation of garmin’s subsidiaries in international markets results in exposure to movements in currency exchange rates we have experienced significant foreign currency gains and losses due to the strengthening and weakening of the us dollar the potential of volatile foreign exchange rate fluctuations in the future could have a significant effect on our results of operations the company has not historically hedged its foreign currency exchange rate risks 

 

the currencies that create a majority of the company’s exchange rate exposure are the taiwan dollar euro and british pound sterling garmin corporation headquartered in sijhih taiwan uses the local currency as the functional currency the company translates all assets and liabilities at yearend exchange rates and income and expense accounts at average rates during the year in order to minimize the effect of the currency exchange fluctuations on our net assets we have elected to retain most of our taiwan subsidiary’s cash and investments in marketable securities denominated in us dollars

 

most european subsidiaries use the euro as the functional currency  the functional currency of our largest european subsidiary garmin europe ltd remains the us dollar and as some transactions occurred in british pounds sterling or euros foreign currency gains or losses have been realized historically related to the movements of those currencies relative to the us dollar the company believes that gains and losses will become more material in the future as our european presence grows in 2014 the us dollar strengthened 114 and 55 respectively relative to the euro and british pound sterling resulting in a foreign currency loss of 437 million in garmin ltd and our european subsidiaries the us dollar strengthened 55 against the taiwan dollar resulting in a 448 million foreign currency gain due to the fluctuation of asset balances throughout the year the net result of these currency moves combined with other losses of 54 million and the timing of transactions during the year was a net loss of 43 million for the company and a cumulative translation adjustment of 645 million during the fiscal year 2014

 

we assessed the company’s exposure to movements in currency exchange rates by performing a sensitivity analysis of adverse changes in exchange rates and the corresponding impact to our results of operations based on total monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than respective functional currencies as of december 27 2014 a hypothetical and reasonably possible adverse change of 10 for the taiwan dollar euro and british pound sterling would have resulted in an adverse impact on income before income taxes of approximately 118 million at december 27 2014

 





 

interest rate risk 

 

we have no outstanding longterm debt as of december 27 2014 we therefore have no meaningful debtrelated interest rate risk

 

we are exposed to interest rate risk in connection with our investments in marketable securities as interest rates change the unrealized gains and losses associated with those securities will fluctuate accordingly

the company’s investment policy requires investments to be rated a or better with the objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss the company does not intend to sell securities in an unrealized loss position and it is not more likely than not that the company will be required to sell such investments before recovery of their amortized costs bases which may be maturity during 2014 and 2013 the company did not record any material impairment charges on its outstanding securities

 

we assessed the company’s exposure to interest rate risk by performing a sensitivity analysis of a parallel shift in the yield curve and the corresponding impact to the company’s portfolio of marketable securities based on balance sheet positions as of december 27 2014 a hypothetical and reasonably possible 100 basis point increase in interest rates across all maturities would result in an approximate 52 million decline in the fair market value of the portfolio such losses would only be realized if the company sold the investments prior to maturity

company overview 

  

garmin is a leading worldwide provider of navigation communication and information devices and applications many of which are enabled by global positioning system gps technology garmin designs develops manufactures and markets a diverse family of handheld portable and fixedmount gpsenabled products and other navigation communications and information products for the automotivemobile outdoor fitness marine and general aviation markets   

  

overview of the global positioning system 

  

the global positioning system is a worldwide navigation system which enables the precise determination of geographic location using established satellite technology the system consists of a constellation of orbiting satellites the satellites and their ground control and monitoring stations are maintained and operated by the united states department of defense which maintains an ongoing satellite replenishment program to ensure continuous global system coverage   access to the system is provided free of charge by the us government 

  

prior to may 2000 the us department of defense intentionally degraded the accuracy of civilian gps signals in a process known as selective availability sa for national security purposes sa variably degraded gps position accuracy to a radius of 100 meters on may 2 2000 the us department of defense discontinued sa in a presidential policy statement issued in december 2004 the bush administration indicated that the us does not intend to implement sa again and is committed to preventing hostile use of gps through regional denial of service minimizing the impact to peaceful users with sa removed a gps receiver can calculate its position to an accuracy of approximately 10 meters or less enhancing the utility of gps for most applications 

  

the accuracy and utility of gps can be enhanced through augmentation techniques which compute any remaining errors in the signal and broadcast these corrections to a gps device the federal aviation administration “faa” has developed a wide area augmentation system waas comprising ground reference stations and additional satellites that improve the accuracy of gps positioning available in the united states and most of canada and mexico to approximately 3 meters waas supports the use of gps as the primary means of enroute terminal and approach navigation for aviation in the united states the increased accuracy offered by waas also enhances the utility of waasenabled gps receivers for consumer applications the faa announced on july 11 2003 that the waas system had achieved initial operating capability and that the system was available for instrument flight use with appropriately certified avionics equipment since that time the faa has installed additional ground reference stations and has launched additional waas satellites 

  

japan’s mtsatbased satellite augmentation system msas achieved initial operating capability for en route terminal and approach navigation for aviation on september 27 2007   the european geostationary navigation overlay service egnos aviation safety of life sol service achieved initial operating capability for en route terminal and approach navigation on march 2 2011

materials 

  

although most components essential to garmin’s business are generally available from multiple sources certain key components including but not limited to microprocessors certain liquid crystal displays lcds and certain applicationspecific integrated circuits asics are currently obtained by the company from single or limited sources which subjects garmin to supply and pricing risks   many of these and other key components that are available from multiple sources including but not limited to nand flash memory dynamic random access memory dram gps chipsets and certain lcds are subject at times to industrywide shortages and commodity pricing fluctuations 

 

  garmin and other participants in the personal computer tablet mobile communication aviation electronics and consumer electronics industries also compete for various components with other industries that have experienced increased demand for their products   in addition garmin uses some custom components that are not common to the rest of the personal computer tablet mobile communication and consumer electronics industries and new products introduced by the company often utilize custom components available from only one source until garmin has evaluated whether there is a need for and subsequently qualifies additional suppliers when a component or product uses new technologies initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields have matured or manufacturing capacity has increased   garmin makes efforts to manage risks in these areas through the use of supply agreements for strategically important components   nevertheless if   garmin’s supply of a key singlesourced component for a new or existing product was delayed or constrained if such components were available only at significantly higher prices or if a key manufacturing vendor delayed shipments of completed products to garmin garmin’s financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected garmin’s business and financial performance could also be adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the original source or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source continued availability of these components at acceptable prices or at all may be affected if those suppliers decided to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet garmin’s requirements 

  

seasonality 

  

  our sales are subject to seasonal fluctuation   sales of our consumer products are generally higher in the fourth quarter due to increased demand during the holiday buying season and to a lesser extent the second quarter due to increased demand during the spring and summer season and the father’s daygraduation buying season   sales of consumer products are also influenced by the timing of the release of new products   our aviation products do not experience much seasonal variation but are more influenced by the timing of the release of new products when the initial demand is typically the strongest 

  

backlog 

  

  our sales are generally of a consumer nature and there is a relatively short cycle between order and shipment   therefore we believe that backlog information is not material to the understanding of our business   we typically ship most orders within 72 hours of receipt 

  

intellectual property 

  

our success and ability to compete is dependent in part on our proprietary technology   we rely on a combination of patent copyright trademark and trade secret laws as well as confidentiality agreements to establish and protect our proprietary rights in addition garmin often relies on licenses of intellectual property for use in its business for example garmin obtains licenses for digital cartography technology for use in our products from various sources   

  

  as of february 1 2014 garmin’s worldwide ip portfolio includes over 820 patent and 470 trademark registrations issued worldwide for the past seven years garmin has been selected as a constituent of the ocean tomo ® 300 patent index which recognizes companies with high intellectual property value we believe that our continued success depends on the intellectual skills of our employees and their ability to continue to innovate garmin will continue to file and prosecute patent applications when appropriate to attempt to protect garmin’s rights in its proprietary technologies 

 

there is no assurance that our current patents or patents which we may later acquire may successfully withstand any challenge in whole or in part it is also possible that any patent issued to us may not provide us with any competitive advantages or that the patents of others will preclude us from manufacturing and marketing certain products despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary   litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights to protect our trade secrets to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others or to defend against claims of infringement or invalidity 

  

regulations 

  

the telecommunications industry is highly regulated and the regulatory environment in which garmin operates is subject to change   in accordance with the united states’ federal communications commission fcc rules and regulations wireless transceiver products are required to be certified by the fcc and comparable authorities in foreign countries where they are sold   garmin’s products sold in europe are required to comply with relevant directives of the european commission   a delay in receiving required certifications for new products or enhancements to garmin’s products or losing certification for garmin’s existing products could adversely affect our business   in addition aviation products that are intended for installation in “type certificated aircraft” are required to be certified by the faa its european counterpart the european aviation safety agency and other comparable organizations before they can be used in an aircraft   

  

because garmin corporation one of the company’s principal subsidiaries is located in taiwan foreign exchange control laws and regulations of taiwan with respect to remittances into and out of taiwan may have an impact on garmin’s operations   the taiwan foreign exchange control statute and regulations thereunder provides that all foreign exchange transactions must be executed by banks designated to handle such business by the ministry of finance of taiwan and by the central bank of the republic of china taiwan also referred to as the cbc   current regulations favor traderelated foreign exchange transactions consequently foreign currency earned from exports of merchandise and services may now be retained and used freely by exporters while all foreign currency needed for the import of merchandise and services may be purchased freely from the designated foreign exchange banks   aside from traderelated foreign exchange transactions taiwan companies and residents may without foreign exchange approval remit outside and into taiwan foreign currencies of up to 50 million and 5 million respectively or their equivalent each calendar year   currency conversions within the limits are processed by the designated banks and do not have to be reviewed and approved by the cbc   the above limits apply to remittances involving a conversion between new taiwan dollars and us dollars or other foreign currencies   the cbc typically approves foreign exchange in excess of the limits if a party applies with the cbc for review and presents legitimate business reasons justifying the currency conversion   a requirement is also imposed on all enterprises to register all medium and longterm foreign debt with the cbc 

  

environmental matters 

  

garmin’s operations are subject to various environmental laws including laws addressing air and water pollution and management of hazardous substances and wastes substantial noncompliance with applicable environmental laws could have a material adverse effect on our business currently we do not anticipate material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities 

  

environmental regulation of garmin’s products is increasing many of garmins products are subject to laws relating to the chemical and material composition of our products and their energy efficiency garmin is also subject to laws requiring manufacturers to be financially responsible for collection recovery and recycling of wastes from certain electronic products   compliance with current environmental laws does not have a material impact on our business but the impact of future enactment of environmental laws cannot yet be fully determined and could be substantial 

  

garmin has implemented multiple environmental management system ems policies in accordance with the international organization for standardization iso 14001 standard for environmental health and safety management garmin’s ems policies set forth practices standards and procedures to ensure compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations at garmin’s kansas headquarters facility garmin’s european headquarters facility and garmin’s taiwan manufacturing facility 

 

regulatory and “green procurement” demands from our customers are also increasing particularly in the areas of restricted substance use and environmentallyfriendly design and manufacture initiatives the overall impacts of these customer requirements cannot yet be established garmin is committed to improving our products and processes to meet our customer needs 

  

employees 

  

    as of december 28 2013 garmin had 10086 full and parttime employees worldwide of whom 3804 were in the united states 75 were in canada 4687 were in taiwan 1117 were in europe and 403 were in other global locations   except for some of garmin’s employees in brazil and sweden none of garmin’s employees are represented by a labor union and none of garmins north american or taiwan employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement   garmin considers its employee relations to be good 

  




 item 1a   risk factors 

  

the risks described below are not the only ones facing our company   additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also impair our business operations   if any of the following risks occur our business financial condition or operating results could be materially adversely affected 

  

risks related to the company 

  

the demand for personal navigation devices pnds has been and continues to be reduced by replacement technologies becoming available on mobile devices and factoryinstalled systems in new autos 

  

  from 2005 to 2008 we experienced substantial growth in the automotivemobile segment   this has resulted in gpsnavigation technologies being incorporated into competing devices such as mobile handsets tablets and new automobiles through factoryinstalled systems   mobile handsets and tablets are frequently gpsenabled and many companies are now offering navigation software for these mobile devices   the acceptance of this technology by consumers has halted our growth in this segment and reduced margins   navigation systems are also becoming more prevalent as optional equipment on new automobiles   increased navigation penetration on mobile handsets and in new automobiles is expected to cause further declines in sales of our portable navigation devices and could further reduced margins 

  

our financial results are dependent on the automotivemobile segment which represents approximately 50 of our revenues is maturing and expected to further decline in 2014 

  

  we experienced substantial growth through 2008 in the automotivemobile segment of our business as the products became massmarket consumer electronics in both europe and north america   this market has peaked as penetration rates increased and competing technologies emerged   this has resulted in and could continue to result in lower revenues for this segment and lower earnings per share 

economic conditions and uncertainty could adversely affect our revenue and margins 

  

our revenue and margins depend significantly on general economic conditions and the demand for products in the markets in which we compete   economic weakness or constrained consumer and business spending has resulted in decreased revenue and in the future could result in decreased revenue and problems with our ability to manage inventory levels and collect customer receivables in addition financial difficulties experienced by our retailer and oem customers have resulted and could result in the future in significant bad debt writeoffs and additions to reserves in our receivables and could have an adverse affect on our results of operations   

 

  

 

  

gross margins for our products may fluctuate or erode 

  

gross margins in some of our segments have declined in recent years and could further decline in the future due to competitive price reductions that are not fully offset by material cost reductions in addition our overall gross margin may fluctuate from period to period due to a number of factors including product mix competition and unit volumes   in particular the average selling prices of a specific product tend to decrease over that product’s life   to offset such decreases we intend to rely primarily on component cost reduction obtaining yield improvements and corresponding cost reductions in the manufacturing of existing products and on introducing new products that incorporate advanced features and therefore can be sold at higher average selling prices   however there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain any such yield improvements or cost reductions or introduce any such new products in the future   to the extent that such cost reductions and new product introductions do not occur in a timely manner or our products do not achieve market acceptance our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

  

changes in our united states federal income tax classification or in applicable tax laws could result in adverse tax consequences to our shareholders 

  

we do not believe that we or any of our united states or nonunited states subsidiaries are currently a ‘‘passive foreign investment company’’ for united states federal income tax purposes we do not expect to become a passive foreign investment company however because the passive foreign investment company determination is made annually based on whether the company’s income or assets meet certain thresholds as determined under united states federal tax principles which are based on facts and circumstances that may be beyond our control we cannot assure that we will not become a passive foreign investment company in the future if we are a passive foreign investment company in any year then any of our shareholders that is a united states person could be liable to pay tax on their pro rata share of our income plus an interest charge upon some distributions by us or when that shareholder sells our common shares at a gain further if we are classified as a passive foreign investment company in any year in which a united states person is a shareholder we generally will continue to be treated as a passive foreign investment company with respect to such shareholder in all succeeding years regardless of whether we continue to satisfy the income or asset tests mentioned above 

  

we do not believe that we or any of our united states or nonunited states subsidiaries are currently a controlled foreign corporation cfc for united states federal income tax purposes   we do not expect to become a cfc   the cfc determination is made daily based on whether the united states shareholders own more than fifty percent of the voting power or value of the company   only united states persons that own ten percent or more of the voting power of the company’s shares qualify as united states shareholders   if the company were to be classified as a cfc for an uninterrupted thirty day period in any year the company’s shareholders that qualify as united states shareholders could be liable to pay us income tax at ordinary income tax rates on their prorata share of certain categories of the company’s income for the period in which the company is classified as a cfc as the company cannot control the ownership of the company’s stock nor can the company control which shareholders participate in the company’s stock buyback program ownership changes could result that create united states shareholders which increase the risk of garmin being treated as a cfc 

  

legislative proposals have been considered in the united states within the past few years that could increase the united states tax burden of corporations with international operations and could broaden the circumstances under which foreign corporations could be considered resident in the united states legislative proposals are being considered in switzerland that could make significant changes in the corporate tax regime and increase the taxes applicable to us in switzerland our tax position could be adversely impacted by changes in swiss united states or foreign tax laws tax treaties or tax regulations or the interpretation or enforcement thereof by any tax authority we cannot predict the outcome of any specific legislative proposals 

 

if we are not successful in the continued development introduction or timely manufacture of new products demand for our products could decrease 

  

we expect that a significant portion of our future revenue will continue to be derived from sales of newly introduced products   the market for our products is characterized by rapidly changing technology evolving industry standards and changes in customer needs   if we fail to introduce new products or to modify or improve our existing products in response to changes in technology industry standards or customer needs our products could rapidly become less competitive or obsolete   we must continue to make significant investments in research and development in order to continue to develop new products enhance existing products and achieve market acceptance for such products   however there can be no assurance that development stage products will be successfully completed or if developed will achieve significant customer acceptance 

  

if we are unable to successfully develop and introduce competitive new products and enhance our existing products our future results of operations would be adversely affected   our pursuit of necessary technology may require substantial time and expense   we may need to license new technologies to respond to technological change   these licenses may not be available to us on terms that we can accept or may materially change the gross profits that we are able to obtain on our products we may not succeed in adapting our products to new technologies as they emerge   development and manufacturing schedules for technology products are difficult to predict and there can be no assurance that we will achieve timely initial customer shipments of new products   the timely availability of these products in volume and their acceptance by customers are important to our future success   from time to time we have experienced delays in shipping certain of our new products and any future delays whether due to product development delays manufacturing delays lack of market acceptance delays in regulatory approval or otherwise could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

  

if we are unable to compete effectively with existing or new competitors our resulting loss of competitive position could result in price reductions fewer customer orders reduced margins and loss of market share 

  

the markets for many of our products are highly competitive and we expect competition to increase in the future some of our competitors have significantly greater financial technical and marketing resources than we do   these competitors may be able to respond more rapidly to new or emerging technologies or changes in customer requirements   they may also be able to devote greater resources to the development promotion and sale of their products   increased competition could result in price reductions fewer customer orders reduced margins and loss of market share   our failure to compete successfully against current or future competitors could seriously harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

we rely on independent dealers and distributors to sell our products and disruption to these channels would harm our business 

  

because we sell a majority of our products to independent dealers and distributors we are subject to many risks including risks related to their inventory levels and support for our products   in particular our dealers and distributors maintain significant levels of our products in their inventories   if dealers and distributors attempt to reduce their levels of inventory or if they do not maintain sufficient levels to meet customer demand our sales could be negatively impacted 

  

many of our dealers and distributors also sell products offered by our competitors   if our competitors offer our dealers and distributors more favorable terms those dealers and distributors may deemphasize or decline to carry our products in the future we may not be able to retain or attract a sufficient number of qualified dealers and distributors   if we are unable to maintain successful relationships with dealers and distributors or to expand our distribution channels our business will suffer 

 

our quarterly operating results are subject to fluctuations and seasonality 

  

our operating results are difficult to predict our future quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly   if such operating results decline the price of our stock would likely decline   as we have expanded our operations our operating expenses particularly our research and development costs have increased as a percentage of our sales   if revenues decrease and we continue to increase research and development costs our operating results would be negatively affected 

  

historically our revenues have been weaker in the first quarter of each fiscal year as our devices are highly consumeroriented and consumer buying is traditionally lower in this quarter   sales of certain of our marine and automotive products tend to be higher in our second fiscal quarter due to increased consumer spending for such products during the recreational marine fishing and travel season   sales of many of our consumer products also have been higher in our fourth fiscal quarter due to increased consumer spending patterns on electronic devices during the holiday season   in addition we attempt to time our new product releases to coincide with relatively higher consumer spending in the second and fourth fiscal quarters which contributes to these seasonal variations 

  

our quarterly financial statements will reflect fluctuations in foreign currency translation 

  

the operation of garmin’s subsidiaries in international markets results in exposure to movements in currency exchange rates   we have experienced significant foreign currency gains and losses due to the strengthening and weakening of the us dollar   the potential of volatile foreign exchange rate fluctuations in the future could have a significant effect on our results of operations 

  

  the currencies that create a majority of the company’s exchange rate exposure are the taiwan dollar euro and british pound sterling   garmin corporation headquartered in sijhih taiwan uses the local currency as the functional currency   the company translates all assets and liabilities at yearend exchange rates and income and expense accounts at average rates during the year   in order to minimize the effect of the currency exchange fluctuations on our net assets we have elected to retain most of our taiwan subsidiary’s cash and investments in marketable securities denominated in us dollars 

  

  nonetheless us gaap requires the company at the end of each accounting period to translate into taiwan dollars all such us dollar denominated assets held by our taiwan subsidiary   this translation is required because the taiwan dollar is the functional currency of the subsidiary   this us gaapmandated translation will cause us to recognize gain or loss on our financial statements as the taiwan dollarus dollar exchange rate varies   such gain or loss will create variations in our earnings per share   because there is minimal cash impact caused by such exchange rate variations management will continue to focus on the company’s operating performance before the impact of the foreign currency translation 

  

if we do not correctly anticipate demand for our products we may not be able to secure sufficient quantities or costeffective production of our products or we could have costly excess production or inventories 

  

we have generally been able to increase production to meet this increasing demand   however the demand for our products depends on many factors and will be difficult to forecast   we expect that it will become more difficult to forecast demand as we introduce and support multiple products as competition in the market for our products intensifies and as the markets for some of our products mature to the mass market category   significant unanticipated fluctuations in demand could cause the following problems in our operations 

  

 

 

      we have benefited in the past from taiwan government tax incentives offered on certain high technology capital investments that may not always be available 

  

our effective tax rate is lower than the us federal statutory rate in part because we have benefited from incentives offered in taiwan related to our high technology investments in taiwan   the loss of these tax benefits has begun to have a negative impact on our effective tax rate and reduced benefits will continue into the future 

  

we may experience unique economic and political risks associated with companies that operate in taiwan 

  

relations between taiwan and the people’s republic of china also referred to as the prc and other factors affecting the political or economic conditions of taiwan in the future could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations and the market price and the liquidity of our shares   our principal manufacturing facilities where we manufacture all of our products except our panelmounted aviation products are located in taiwan 

  

taiwan has a unique international political status   the prc asserts sovereignty over all of china including taiwan certain other islands and all of mainland china   the prc government does not recognize the legitimacy of the taiwan government   although significant economic and cultural relations have been established during recent years between taiwan and the prc the prc government has indicated that it may use military force to gain control over taiwan in certain circumstances such as the declaration of independence by taiwan   relations between taiwan and the prc have on occasion adversely affected the market value of taiwanese companies and could negatively affect our operations in taiwan in the future 

  

our intellectual property rights are important to our operations and we could suffer loss if they infringe upon other’s rights or are infringed upon by others 

  

we rely on a combination of patents copyrights trademarks and trade secrets confidentiality provisions and licensing arrangements to establish and protect our proprietary rights   to this end we hold rights to a number of patents and registered trademarks and regularly file applications to attempt to protect our rights in new technology and trademarks   however there is no guarantee that our patent applications will become issued patents or that our trademark applications will become registered trademarks   moreover even if approved our patents or trademarks may thereafter be successfully challenged by others or otherwise become invalidated for a variety of reasons   thus any patents or trademarks we currently have or may later acquire may not provide us a significant competitive advantage 

  

third parties may claim that we are infringing their intellectual property rights   such claims could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition   from time to time we receive letters alleging infringement of patents trademarks or other intellectual property rights   litigation concerning patents or other intellectual property is costly and time consuming   we may seek licenses from such parties but they could refuse to grant us a license or demand commercially unreasonable terms   we might not have sufficient resources to pay for the licenses   such infringement claims could also cause us to incur substantial liabilities and to suspend or permanently cease the use of critical technologies or processes or the production or sale of major products 

 

we may become subject to significant product liability costs 

if our aviation products malfunction or contain errors or defects airplane collisions or crashes could occur resulting in property damage personal injury or death   malfunctions or errors or defects in our marine navigational products could cause boats to run aground or cause other wreckage personal injury or death   if our automotive or marine products contain defects or errors in the mapping supplied by thirdparty map providers or if our users do not heed our warnings about the proper use of these products collisions or accidents could occur resulting in property damage personal injury or death   if any of these events occurs we could be subject to significant liability for personal injury and property damage and under certain circumstances could be subject to a judgment for punitive damages   we maintain insurance against accidentrelated risks involving our products   however there can be no assurance that such insurance would be sufficient to cover the cost of damages to others or that such insurance will continue to be available at commercially reasonable rates   in addition insurance coverage generally will not cover awards of punitive damages and may not cover the cost of associated legal fees and defense costs which could result in lower margins   if we are unable to maintain sufficient insurance to cover product liability costs or if our insurance coverage does not cover the award this could have a materially adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

we depend on our suppliers some of which are the sole source for specific components and our production would be seriously harmed if these suppliers are not able to meet our demand and alternative sources are not available or if the costs of components rise 

  

we are dependent on third party suppliers for various components used in our current products   some of the components that we procure from third party suppliers include semiconductors and electroluminescent panels liquid crystal displays memory chips batteries and microprocessors   the cost quality and availability of components are essential to the successful production and sale of our products   some components we use are from sole source suppliers certain applicationspecific integrated circuits incorporating our proprietary designs are manufactured for us by sole source suppliers   alternative sources may not be currently available for these sole source components 

  

in the past we have experienced shortages of liquid crystal displays and other components   in addition if there are shortages in supply of components the costs of such components may rise if suppliers are unable to meet our demand for components on a timely basis and if we are unable to obtain an alternative source or if the price of the alternative source is prohibitive or if the costs of components rise our ability to maintain timely and costeffective production of our products would be seriously harmed 

  

we depend on third party licensors for the digital map data contained in our automotivemobile products and our business andor gross margins could be harmed if we become unable to continue licensing such mapping data or if the royalty costs for such data rise 

  

we license digital mapping data for use in our products from various sources   there are only a limited number of suppliers of mapping data for each geographical region   the two largest digital map suppliers are here formerly known as navteq and tele atlas nv   here is owned by nokia oyj and tele atlas nv is owned by tomtom nv   nokia and tomtom are both competitors of garmin 

  

  although we do not foresee difficulty in continuing to license data at favorable pricing due to the long term license extension signed between garmin and here in june 2010 extending our here license agreement through 2017 with an option to extend through 2021 if we are unable to continue licensing such mapping data and are unable to obtain an alternative source or if the nature of our relationships with here changes detrimentally our ability to supply mapping data for use in our products would be seriously harmed 

 

we may pursue strategic acquisitions investments strategic partnerships or other ventures and our business could be materially harmed if we fail to successfully identify complete and integrate such transactions 

we intend to evaluate acquisition opportunities and opportunities to make investments in complementary businesses technologies services or products or to enter into strategic partnerships with parties who can provide access to those assets additional product or services offerings additional distribution or marketing synergies or additional industry expertise   we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition investment or strategic partnership candidates or if we do identify suitable candidates in the future we may not be able to complete those transactions on commercially favorable terms or at all 

  

any past or future acquisitions could also result in difficulties assimilating acquired employees including cultural differences with foreign acquisitions operations and products and diversion of capital and management’s attention away from other business issues and opportunities   integration of acquired companies may result in problems related to integration of technology and inexperienced management teams in addition the key personnel of the acquired company may decide not to work for us   we may not successfully integrate internal controls compliance under the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 and other corporate governance matters operations personnel or products related to acquisitions we have made in previous years or may make in the future   if we fail to successfully integrate such transactions our business could be materially harmed 

  

we may have additional tax liabilities 

  

we are subject to income taxes in switzerland the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes in the ordinary course of our business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain we are regularly under audit by tax authorities although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals the results of an audit or litigation could have a material effect on our income tax provision net income or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made 

  

failure to obtain required certifications of our products on a timely basis could harm our business 

  

we have certain products especially in our aviation segment that are subject to governmental and similar certifications before they can be sold   for example faa certification is required for all of our aviation products that are intended for installation in type certificated aircraft   to the extent required certification is an expensive and timeconsuming process that requires significant focus and resources   an inability to obtain or excessive delay in obtaining such certifications could have an adverse effect on our ability to introduce new products and for certain aviation oem products our customers’ ability to sell airplanes delays in our obtaining certification for our aviation products have resulted and may in the future result in our being required to pay compensation to our customers   therefore such inabilities or delays could adversely affect our operating results   in addition we cannot assure you that our certified products will not be decertified   any such decertification could have an adverse effect on our operating results 

  

our business may suffer if we are not able to hire and retain sufficient qualified personnel or if we lose our key personnel 

  

our future success depends partly on the continued contribution of our key executive engineering sales marketing manufacturing and administrative personnel   we currently do not have employment agreements with any of our key executive officers swiss law prohibits us from paying severance payments to our senior executive officers which may impair our ability to recruit for these positions   we do not have key man life insurance on any of our key executive officers and do not currently intend to obtain such insurance   the loss of the services of any of our senior level management or other key employees could harm our business   recruiting and retaining the skilled personnel we require to maintain and grow our market position may be difficult   for example in some recent years there has been a nationwide shortage of qualified electrical engineers and software engineers who are necessary for us to design and develop new products and therefore it has sometimes been challenging to recruit such personnel   if we fail to hire and retain qualified employees we may not be able to maintain and expand our business 

 

there is uncertainty as to our shareholders’ ability to enforce certain foreign civil liabilities in switzerland and taiwan 

  

we are a swiss company and a substantial portion of our assets are located outside the united states particularly in taiwan   as a result it may be difficult to effect service of process within the united states upon us   in addition there is uncertainty as to whether the courts of switzerland or taiwan would recognize or enforce judgments of united states courts obtained against us predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the united states or any state thereof or be competent to hear original actions brought in switzerland or taiwan against us predicated upon the securities laws of the united states or any state thereof 

  

a shut down of us airspace or imposition of restrictions on general aviation would harm our business 

  

following the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks the faa ordered all aircraft operating in the us to be grounded for several days   in addition to this shut down of us airspace the general aviation industry was further impacted by the additional restrictions implemented by the faa on those flights that fly utilizing visual flight rules vfr   the faa restricted vfr flight inside 30 enhanced class b a 2025 mile radius around the 30 largest metropolitan areas in the usa airspace areas   the aircraft owners and pilots association aopa estimated that these restrictions affected approximately 41800 general aviation aircraft based at 282 airports inside the 30 enhanced class b airspace areas   the aopa estimates that approximately 90 of all general aviation flights are conducted vfr and that only 15 of general aviation pilots are current to fly utilizing instrument flight rules ifr 

  

the shutdown of us airspace following september 11 2001 caused reduced sales of our general aviation products and delays in the shipment of our products manufactured in our taiwan manufacturing facility to our distribution facility in olathe kansas thereby adversely affecting our ability to supply new and existing products to our dealers and distributors 

  

any future shut down of us airspace or imposition of restrictions on general aviation could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results 

a shut down of federal aviation administration operations would harm our business 

  

any failure of congress to appropriate funds for faa operations that results in any shut down of faa operations or furloughing of faa employees could result in delays in the required faa certification of our avionics products and in the production sale and registration of aircraft that use our avionics products   such delays could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results 

  

many of our products rely on the global positioning system 

  

the global positioning system gps is a satellitebased navigation and positioning system consisting of a constellation of orbiting satellites   the satellites and their ground control and monitoring stations are maintained and operated by the united states department of defense   the department of defense does not currently charge users for access to the satellite signals   these satellites and their ground support systems are complex electronic systems subject to electronic and mechanical failures and possible sabotage the satellites were originally designed to have lives of 75 years and are subject to damage by the hostile space environment in which they operate   however of the current deployment of satellites in place some have been operating for more than 12 years 

  

to repair damaged or malfunctioning satellites is currently not economically feasible if a significant number of satellites were to become inoperable there could be a substantial delay before they are replaced with new satellites a reduction in the number of operating satellites may impair the current utility of the gps system and the growth of current and additional market opportunities gps satellites and ground control segments are being modernized gps modernization software updates can cause problems we depend on public access to open technical specifications in advance of gps updates 

  

gps is operated by the u s government which is committed to maintenance and improvement of gps however if the policy were to change and gps were no longer supported by the u s government or if user fees were imposed it could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

 

some of our products also use signals from satellite based augmentation systems sbas that augment gps such as the us wide area augmentation system waas japanese mtsatbased satellite augmentation system msas and european geostationary navigation overlay service egnos   any curtailment of sbas operating capability could result in decreased user capability for many of our aviation products thereby impacting our markets 

  

any of the foregoing factors could affect the willingness of buyers of our products to select global positioning systembased products instead of products based on competing technologies 

  

any reallocation or repurposing of radio frequency spectrum could cause harmful interference with the reception of global positioning system signals this interference could harm our business 

  

our global positioning system technology is dependent on the use of the standard positioning service sps provided by the us government’s global positioning system satellites   the global positioning system operates in radio frequency bands that are globally allocated for radio navigation satellite services   international allocations of radio frequency are made by the international telecommunications union itu a specialized technical agency of the united nations these allocations are further governed by radio regulations that have treaty status and which may be subject to modification every two to three years by the world radio communication conference each country also has regulatory authority on how each band is used in the united states the federal communications commission fcc and the national telecommunications and information administration ntia share responsibility for radio frequency allocations and spectrum usage regulations   

  

any itu or national reallocation of radio frequency spectrum including frequency band segmentation or sharing of spectrum or other modifications of the permitted uses of relevant frequency bands may materially and adversely affect the utility and reliability of our products and have significant negative impacts on our business and our customers for example the fcc has been considering a proposal by a private party lightsquared to repurpose spectrum adjacent to the gps bands for terrestrial broadband wireless operations in metropolitan areas throughout the united states if the fcc were to permit implementation of lightsquared’s proposal terrestrial broadband wireless operations could create harmful interference to gps receivers within range of such operations   

  

our business is subject to disruptions and uncertainties caused by war or terrorism 

  

acts of war or acts of terrorism especially any directed at the gps signals could have a material adverse impact on our business operating results and financial condition the threat of terrorism and war and heightened security and military response to this threat or any future acts of terrorism may cause a redeployment of the satellites used in gps or interruptions of the system to the extent that such interruptions have an effect on sales of our products this could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

privacy concerns relating to our technology could damage our reputation and deter current and potential users from using our products and applications 

  

concerns about our practices with regard to the collection use disclosure or security of personal information user location information or other privacy related matters even if unfounded could damage our reputation and operating results while we strive to comply with all applicable data protection laws and regulations as well as our own posted privacy policies any failure or perceived failure to comply may result in proceedings or actions against us by government entities or others or could cause us to lose users and customers which could potentially have an adverse effect on our business 

  

regulatory authorities around the world are considering a number of legislative and regulatory proposals concerning data protection in addition the interpretation and application of consumer and data protection laws in the us europe and elsewhere are often uncertain and in flux it is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our data practices if so in addition to the possibility of fines this could result in an order requiring that we change our data practices which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations complying with these various laws could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business 

 

security breaches and other disruptions including as a result of cyber attacks could compromise our information and expose us to liability which would cause our business and reputation to suffer   

  

in the ordinary course of our business we collect and store sensitive data including intellectual property our proprietary business information and that of our customers and suppliers and some personally identifiable information of our customers and employees in our facilities and on our networks the secure processing maintenance and transmission of this information is important to our operations despite our security measures our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error or other disruptions any such breach could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed publicly disclosed lost or stolen any such access disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings disrupt our operations damage our reputation and cause a loss of confidence which could adversely affect our business 

  

we may be exposed to certain regulatory and financial risks related to climate change 

    

climate change is receiving increasing attention worldwide some scientists legislators and others attribute global warming to increased levels of greenhouse gases including carbon dioxide which has led to significant legislative and regulatory efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions 

  

various regulatory and legislative measures to address greenhouse gas emissions are in different phases of implementation or discussion in the aftermath of its 2009 “endangerment finding” that greenhouse gas emissions pose a threat to human health and welfare the environmental protection agency has begun to regulate greenhouse gas emissions under the authority granted to it under the clean air act   at the federal legislative level congressional passage of legislation adopting some form of federal mandatory greenhouse gas emission reduction such as a nationwide capandtrade program does not appear likely at this time although it could be adopted at a future date it is also possible that congress may pass alternative climate change bills that do not mandate a nationwide capandtrade program and instead focus on promoting renewable energy and energy efficiency which could increase the cost of doing business 

  

because it is uncertain what laws and regulations will be enacted we cannot predict the potential impact of such laws and regulations on our future consolidated financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

  

risks relating to our shares   

the volatility of our stock price could adversely affect investment in our common shares 

  

the market price of our common shares has been and may continue to be highly volatile   during 2013 the closing price of our common shares ranged from a low of 3260 to a high of 4933 a variety of factors could cause the price of our common shares to fluctuate perhaps substantially including 

  

         

 

     

in addition in recent years the stock market in general and the markets for shares of technology companies in particular have experienced extreme price fluctuations which have often been unrelated to the operating performance of affected companies   any such fluctuations in the future could adversely affect the market price of our common shares 

  

our officers and directors exert substantial influence over us 

  

as of january 13 2014 current members and former members of our board of directors and our executive officers together with members of their families and entities that may be deemed affiliates of or related to such persons or entities beneficially owned approximately 4030 of our outstanding common shares   accordingly these shareholders may be able to determine the outcome of corporate actions requiring shareholder approval such as mergers and acquisitions   this level of ownership may have a significant effect in delaying deferring or preventing a change in control of garmin and may adversely affect the voting and other rights of other holders of our common shares 

  

the rights of our shareholders are governed by swiss law 

  

    the rights of our shareholders are governed by swiss law and garmin ltd’s articles of association the rights of shareholders under swiss law differ from the rights of shareholders of companies incorporated in other jurisdictions for example swiss law allows our shareholders acting at a shareholders’ meeting to authorize share capital that can be issued by the board of directors without approval of a shareholders’ meeting but this authorization is limited to 50 of the existing registered share capital and must be renewed at a shareholders’ meeting at least every two years for it to continue to be available additionally subject to specified exceptions including the exceptions described in our articles of association swiss law grants preemptive rights to existing shareholders to subscribe for new issuances of shares and other securities swiss law also does not provide as much flexibility in the various terms that can attach to different classes of shares as the laws of some other jurisdictions swiss law also reserves for approval by shareholders certain corporate actions over which a board of directors would have authority in some other jurisdictions for example swiss law provides that dividends and other distributions must be approved by shareholders at the general meeting of shareholders these swiss law requirements relating to our capital management may limit our flexibility and situations may arise where greater flexibility would have provided substantial benefits to our shareholders 

  

we may not be able to make distributions or repurchase shares without subjecting you to swiss withholding tax 

  

    if we are unable to make distributions if any through a reduction of par value or to pay dividends if any out of qualifying capital contribution reserves then any dividends paid by us will generally be subject to a swiss federal withholding tax at a rate of 35 the withholding tax must be withheld from the gross distribution and paid to the swiss federal tax administration a us holder that qualifies for benefits under the convention between the united states of america and the swiss confederation for the avoidance of double taxation with respect to taxes on income may apply for a refund of the tax withheld in excess of the 15 treaty rate or in excess of the 5 reduced treaty rate for qualifying corporate shareholders with at least 10 participation in our voting stock or for a full refund in case of qualified pension funds payment of a capital distribution in the form of a par value reduction or a dividend out of qualifying capital contribution reserves is not subject to swiss withholding tax however there can be no assurance that our shareholders will approve a reduction in par value or a dividend out of qualifying capital contribution reserves that we will be able to meet the other legal requirements for a reduction in par value or that swiss withholding rules will not be changed in the future or that a change in swiss law will not adversely affect us or our shareholders in particular as a result of distributions out of qualifying capital contribution reserves becoming subject to additional corporate law or other restrictions there are currently legislative projects pending in swiss parliament and the swiss federal administration that – depending on their final form – may limit the distribution of qualifying capital contribution reserves in addition over the long term the amount of par value and qualifying capital contribution reserves available for us to use for par value reductions or dividends will be limited if we are unable to make a distribution through a reduction in par value or to pay a dividend out of qualifying capital contribution reserves we may not be able to make distributions without subjecting you to swiss withholding taxes 

 

under current swiss tax law repurchases of shares for the purposes of capital reduction are treated as a partial liquidation subject to 35 swiss withholding tax on the difference between the par value and the repurchase price however the portion of the repurchase price that is attributed to qualifying capital contribution reserves of the shares repurchased will not be subject to the swiss withholding tax no partial liquidation treatment applies and no withholding tax is triggered if the shares are not repurchased for cancellation but held by us as treasury shares however should we not resell such treasury shares within six years the withholding tax becomes due at the end of the six year period 

  

we may follow a share repurchase process for future share repurchases if any similar to a second trading line on the six swiss exchange in which swiss institutional investors buy shares on the open market and sell these shares to us and are generally able to receive a refund of the swiss withholding tax however if we are unable to use this process successfully we may not be able to repurchase shares for the purposes of capital reduction without subjecting you to swiss withholding taxes if and to the extent that the repurchase of shares is made out of retained earnings or other taxable reserves no withholding tax would be applicable if and to the extent that qualifying capital contribution reserves are attributable to the share repurchase

garmin’s fiscal year is a 5253 week period ending on the last saturday of the calendar year   fiscal year 2013 and 2012 contained 52 weeks compared to 53 weeks for 2011   unless otherwise stated all years and dates refer to the company’s fiscal year and fiscal periods   unless the context otherwise requires references in this document to we us our and similar terms refer to garmin ltd and its subsidiaries 

  

unless otherwise indicated dollar amounts set forth in the tables are in thousands except per share data 

  

overview   

we are a leading worldwide provider of navigation communications and information devices most of which are enabled by global positioning system or gps technology   we operate in five business segments which serve the marine outdoor fitness automotivemobile and aviation markets   our segments offer products through our network of subsidiary distributors and independent dealers and distributors   however the nature of products and types of customers for the five segments can vary significantly   as such the segments are managed separately   

  

since our first products were delivered in 1991 we have generated positive income from operations each year and have funded our growth from these profits   

  

we experience some foreign currency fluctuations in our operating results   foreign currency gains and losses for the company are primarily tied to movements by the taiwan dollar the euro and the british pound sterling   the taiwan dollar is the functional currency of garmin corporation   the us dollar remains the functional currency of garmin europe   the euro is the functional currency of most european subsidiaries as these entities have grown currency moves can generate material gains and losses   additionally eurobased intercompany transactions in garmin ltd can also generate currency gains and losses   other legal entities primarily use the local currency as the functional currency   due to the relative size of entities using a functional currency other than the taiwan dollar the euro and the british pound sterling currency fluctuations within these entities are not expected to have a material impact on the company’s financial statements 

  

approximately 77 of sales by our european subsidiaries are now denominated in british pounds sterling or the euro   we experienced 355 million in foreign currency gains during fiscal year 2013 and 200 million and 121 million in foreign currency losses during fiscal years 2012 and 2011 respectively   to date we have not entered into hedging transactions related to any currency and we do not currently plan to utilize hedging transactions in the future 

 

critical accounting policies and estimates   general   

garmin’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon garmin’s consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states   the presentation of these financial statements requires garmin to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities   on an ongoing basis garmin evaluates its estimates including those related to customer sales programs and incentives product returns bad debts inventories investments intangible assets income taxes warranty obligations and contingencies and litigation   garmin bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources   actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

  

revenue recognition   

garmin recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred the sales price is fixed or determinable and collection is probable for the large majority of garmin’s sales these criteria are met once product has shipped and title and risk of loss have transferred to the customer the company recognizes revenue from the sale of hardware products and software bundled with hardware that is essential to the functionality of the hardware in accordance with general revenue recognition accounting guidance the company recognizes revenue in accordance with industry specific software accounting guidance for standalone sales of software products and sales of software bundled with hardware not essential to the functionality of the hardware the company generally does not offer specified or unspecified upgrade rights to its customers in connection with software sales 

  

garmin introduced nümaps lifetime™ in january 2009 which is a single fee program that subject to the program’s terms and conditions enables customers to download the latest map and point of interest information every quarter for the useful life of their pnd the revenue and associated cost of royalties for sales of nümaps lifetime™ products are deferred at the time of sale and recognized ratably on a straightline basis over the estimated 36month life of the products   with the acquisition of navigon ag in 2011 products marketed under the navigon brand have a freshmaps program that enables customers to download the latest map and point of interest information for two years the revenue and associated cost of royalties for sales of freshmaps products are deferred at the time of sale and recognized ratably on a straightline basis over the two year period 

  

for multipleelement arrangements that include tangible products that contain software essential to the tangible product’s functionality and undelivered software elements that relate to the tangible product’s essential software the company allocates revenue to all deliverables based on their relative selling prices in such circumstances the accounting principles establish a hierarchy to determine the selling price to be used for allocating revenue to deliverables as follows i vendorspecific objective evidence of fair value vsoe ii thirdparty evidence of selling price tpe and iii best estimate of the selling price esp vsoe generally exists only when the company sells the deliverable separately on more than a limited basis at prices within a relatively narrow range   in addition to the products listed below the company has offered certain other products including mobile applications aviation subscriptions and extended warranties that involve multipleelement arrangements that are immaterial 

 

in 2010 garmin began offering pnds with lifetime map updates lmus bundled in the original purchase price   similar to nümaps lifetime™ lmus enable customers to download the latest map and point of interest information every quarter for the useful life of their pnd   in addition garmin offers pnds with premium traffic service bundled in the original purchase price in the european market   the company has identified multiple deliverables contained in arrangements involving the sale of pnds which include the lmu andor premium traffic service   the first deliverable is the hardware along with the software essential to the functionality of the hardware device delivered at the time of sale   the second and potentially third deliverables are the lmu andor premium traffic service the company has allocated revenue between these deliverables using the relative selling price method   amounts allocated to the delivered hardware and the related essential software are recognized at the time of sale provided the other conditions for revenue recognition have been met the revenue and associated cost of royalties allocated to the lmu andor the subscription for premium traffic service are deferred and recognized on a straightline basis over the estimated 36month life of the products 

  

prior to the third quarter of fiscal 2011 garmin determined its estimate of selling price using the dealerdistributor price for nümaps lifetime or premium traffic subscriptions sold separately and the prices for products bundled with and without the lmu and premium traffic service when comparable models were available as inputs to the relative selling price method in a manner similar to vsoe   the estimated selling price determined in this manner was used to defer revenues for all products bundled with the lmu and premium traffic service as the number of bundled units sold as a percentage of total units sold was less significant and other indicators of selling price were not readily available 

  

during 2011 sales of products bundled with lmus and premium traffic service increased significantly as a percentage of total product sales   concurrently market conditions caused decreases in the asp and margins of comparable models year over year new bundled products were introduced at lower asps and the difference in pricing of bundled units and comparable unbundled models decreased considerably   due to these changes the company determined it was appropriate to change its estimate of the per unit revenue and cost deferrals during the third quarter of 2011 

  

as the sales of nümaps lifetime and premium traffic subscriptions as a percentage of total unit sales or in the aggregate decreased significantly in mid2011 the company determined that the previous estimate of selling price based on more limited standalone sales of nümaps lifetime or premium traffic was no longer a sole determinant of its value as determined under vsoe and that third party evidence of selling price was not available   management determined that the price differential between bundled and unbundled products and the royalty cost of the lmu or premium traffic subscription plus an approximate margin were both additional indicators of estimated selling price   these estimates are also reflective of how the company establishes product pricing based in part on customer perception of value of the added lmu or premium traffic service capability   as such beginning in the third quarter of 2011 the company changed its estimate of selling price of the undelivered element to be based on the relative selling price method using a weighted average of the standalone sales price the price differential between bundled and unbundled units and the royalty or subscription cost plus a normal margin 

  

the impact in 2011 of the change in estimate for lifetime map updates and premium traffic service as described above was an increase in revenue gross profit net income basic net income per share and diluted net income per share of 778 million 665 million 593 million 031 and 030 respectively 

  

garmin records estimated reductions to revenue for customer sales programs returns and incentive offerings including rebates price protection product discounts offered to retailers to assist in clearing older products from their inventories in advance of new product releases promotions and other volumebased incentives   the reductions to revenue are based on estimates and judgments using historical experience and expectation of future conditions   changes in these estimates could negatively affect garmin’s operating results   these incentives are reviewed periodically and with the exceptions of price protection and certain other promotions accrued for on a percentage of sales basis   if market conditions were to decline garmin may take actions to increase customer incentive offerings possibly resulting in an incremental reduction of revenue at the time the incentive is offered 

 

the company records revenue net of sales tax trade discounts and customer returns   the reductions to revenue for expected future product returns are based on garmin’s historical experience 

  

trade accounts receivable 

  

we sell our products to retailers wholesalers and other customers and extend credit based on our evaluation of each customer’s financial condition potential losses on receivables are dependent on each individual customer’s financial condition   we carry our trade accounts receivable at net realizable value   typically our accounts receivable are collected within 80 days and do not bear interest   we monitor our exposure to losses on receivables and maintain allowances for potential losses or adjustments   we determine these allowances by 1 evaluating the aging of our receivables and 2 reviewing our highrisk customers   past due receivable balances are written off when our internal collection efforts have been unsuccessful   beginning in 2011 the company has maintained trade credit insurance to provide security against large losses 

loan receivable 

  

on march 14 2013 the company entered into a memorandum of agreement the “agreement” with bombardier inc “bombardier” the company is the supplier of the avionics system for the lear 70 and lear 75 aircraft currently in development for learjet inc which is a subsidiary of bombardier the “program” in order to assist bombardier in connection with delayed cash flows from the program partially related to the certification of avionics for the program exceeding the planned delivery date the company agreed to provide bombardier a short term interest free loan of 173708 in cash in seven installments beginning on march 22 2013 and ending on september 20 2013 pursuant to the terms and conditions of the agreement bombardier will repay the loan in five installments beginning in november 2013 and ending in april 2014 pursuant to the terms and conditions of the agreement and subsequent amendment signed december 6 2013 as of december 28 2013 the company had a loan receivable balance of 137369 from bombardier in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet 

  warranties   

the company provides for estimated warranty costs at the time of sale the company’s standard warranty obligation to retail partners generally provides for a right of return of any product for a full refund in the event that such product is not merchantable is damaged or defective the company’s historical experience is that these types of warranty obligations are generally fulfilled within 5 months from time of sale the company’s standard warranty obligation to its endusers provides for a period of one to two years from date of shipment while certain aviation products have a warranty period of two years from the date of installation  the company’s estimate of costs to service its warranty obligations are based on historical experience and expectations of future conditions and are recorded as a liability on the balance sheet to the extent garmin experiences increased warranty claim activity or increased costs associated with servicing those claims its warranty accrual will increase resulting in decreased gross profit 

  inventory   

garmin writes down its inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions   if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management additional inventory writedowns may be required 

  

investments 

  

investments are classified as available for sale and recorded at fair value and unrealized investment gains and losses are reflected in stockholders’ equity   investment income is recorded when earned and gains and losses are recognized when investments are sold   investments are reviewed periodically to determine if they have suffered an impairment of value that is considered other than temporary   if investments are determined to be impaired a loss is recognized at the date of determination 

  

testing for impairment of investments requires significant management judgment   the identification of potentially impaired investments the determination of their fair value and the assessment of whether any decline in value is other than temporary are the key judgment elements   the discovery of new information and the passage of time can significantly change these judgments   revisions of impairment judgments are made when new information becomes known and any resulting impairment adjustments are made at that time   the economic environment and volatility of securities markets increase the difficulty of determining fair value and assessing investment impairment   investments are discussed in detail in note 3 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

 

income taxes   

garmin provides deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the difference between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their carrying amount for financial reporting purposes as measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse   it is garmin’s policy to record a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to an amount that it believes is more likely than not to be realized   while garmin has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance in the event garmin were to determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax assets in the future an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such determination is made   likewise should garmin determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase income in the period such determination is made 

  

in addition the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations   we recognize liabilities for tax audit issues in the us and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes will be due   if payment of these amounts ultimately proves not to be required the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary   if our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment a further charge to expense would result 

  

stock based compensation 

  

garmin awards stock options stock appreciation rights sars restricted stock units rsus andor performance shares each year as part of garmin’s compensation package for employees   certain employees within garmin are eligible for stock options sar grants rsu grants andor performance shares but the granting of options sars rsus andor performance shares is at the discretion of the compensation committee of the board of directors and is not a contractual obligation   

  

stockbased compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense on a straightline basis over the requisite service period   determining the fair value of stockbased awards at the grant date requires judgment including estimating expected life forfeitures and dividends   if actual results differ significantly from these estimates stockbased compensation expense could be impacted   stock compensation plans are discussed in detail in note 9 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

  

accounting terms and characteristics 

  

net sales 

  

our net sales are primarily generated through sales to our global dealer and distributor network and to original equipment manufacturers   refer to the revenue recognition discussion above   our sales are largely of a consumer nature therefore backlog levels are not necessarily indicative of our future sales results   we aim to achieve a quick turnaround on orders we receive and we typically ship most orders within 72 hours 

  

net sales are subject to seasonal fluctuation   typically sales of our consumer products are highest in the second quarter due to increased demand during the spring and summer season and in the fourth quarter due to increased demand during the holiday buying season   our aviation products do not experience much seasonal variation but are more influenced by the timing of the release of new products when the initial demand is typically the strongest 

 

cost of salesgross profit   

raw material costs are our most significant component of cost of goods sold   in 2013 gross margin for our automotivemobile segment increased 40 basis points driven primarily by the amortization of previously deferred high margin revenues partially offset by a positive impact to 2012 gross margin from a onetime royalty fee adjustment   see note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information on gross profit deferrals   in 2012 gross margin for our automotivemobile segment increased 560 basis points driven primarily by the amortization of previously deferred high margin revenues the third quarter 2011 change in estimate of per unit revenue and cost deferred as previously discussed and a onetime royalty fee adjustment   in 2011 gross margin for our automotivemobile segment declined 280 basis points driven primarily by the deferral of high margin revenue associated with bundled products partially offset by the change in estimate mentioned above and decreased selling prices on comparable units as well as positive impact to 2010 gross margin from a refinement in the estimated warranty reserve   

  

in 2013 we experienced an 860 basis point decline in marine gross margin due to significant pricing discounts on legacy inventory in the first half of 2013 competitive pricing dynamics on new products and product mix   in 2012 we experienced a 320 and 260 basis point increase in aviation and fitness gross margins respectively   aviation gross margin expansion was driven primarily by product mix and a oem program contribution that negatively impacted gross margins in 2011 fitness gross margin improvement was due to product mix   in 2011 we experienced a 420 basis point decline in marine gross margin due to a shift in product mix   gross margins for the aviation marine outdoor and fitness segments are typically more stable than in the automotivemobile segment   our longterm gross margin targets are 70 55 60 and 60 respectively for these segments 

  

our existing practice of performing the design and manufacture of our products inhouse has enabled us to source components from different suppliers and where possible to redesign our products to leverage lower cost components   we believe that our flexible production model allows our sijhih jhongli and linkou manufacturing plants in taiwan our olathe kansas and salem oregon manufacturing plants to experience relatively low costs of manufacturing   in general products manufactured in taiwan have been our highest volume products   our manufacturing labor costs historically have been lower in taiwan than in olathe and salem 

  

sales price variability has had and can be expected to have an effect on our gross profit   in the past prices of our devices sold into the automotivemobile market have declined due to market pressures and introduction of new products sold at lower price points   the average selling prices of our aviation outdoor fitness and marine products have been stable due to product mix and the introduction of more advanced products sold at higher prices   the effect of the sales price differences inherent within the mix of gpsenabled products sold could have a significant impact on our gross profit 

  

advertising expense 

  

our advertising expenses consist of costs for both media advertising and cooperative advertising with our retail partners   in both 2013 and 2012 we reduced our advertising expense due primarily to reduced cooperative advertising associated with lower volumes in the automotivemobile segment   in 2011 our advertising costs increased slightly as we again experienced revenue growth   we expect advertising costs to increase slightly in 2014 with incremental spending associated with new product categories partially offset by decreased spending in the automotivemobile segment 

  

selling general and administrative expenses 

  

  our selling general and administrative expenses consist primarily of 

  

·   salaries for sales and marketing personnel 

·   salaries and related costs for executives and administrative personnel 

·   marketing and other brand building costs 

 

·   accounting and legal costs 

·   information systems and infrastructure costs 

·   travel and related costs and 

·   occupancy and other overhead costs 

  

selling general and administrative expenses decreased in 2013 after increasing in both 2012 and 2011   the 2013 decrease was primarily driven by reduced legal settlements and related fees   the 2012 increase was primarily driven by full year expenses associated with acquisitions completed in the second half of 2011 and legal costs   the 2011 increase was primarily driven by acquisitions commissions associated with a new webbased sales program bad debt expense legal costs and product support costs we expect selling general and administrative costs excluding advertising to increase slightly in 2014 and remain consistent as a percentage of net sales 

  

research and development 

  

the majority of our research and development costs represent salaries for our engineers costs for high technology components and costs of test equipment used in product and prototype development   approximately 81 of the research and development of our products is performed in north america   

  

we are committed to increasing the level of innovative design and development of new products as we strive for expanded ability to serve our existing consumer and aviation markets as well as new markets for gpsenabled devices   we expect our research and development budget to increase in 2014 due to our ongoing commitment to innovation and growth   

  

customers   

our top ten customers have contributed between 24 and 29 of net sales since 2011   we have experienced average sales days in our customer accounts receivable of between 69 and 72 days since 2011   we expect the level of customer accounts receivable days to be relatively stable in 2014   

  income taxes   

we have experienced a relatively low effective corporate tax rate due to the proportion of our revenue generated by entities in tax jurisdictions with low statutory rates   in particular   the profit entitlement afforded our swissbased companies based on their intellectual property rights ownership of our consumer products along with tax incentives offered by the taiwanese government on certain hightechnology capital investments have continued to reduce our tax rate   we have taken advantage of the tax benefit in taiwan since our inception and we expect to continue to benefit from lower effective tax rates at least through 2015   

  

our consolidated effective tax rate was approximately 63 during 2013   this is a decrease from an effective rate of 131 in 2012   the significant decline was due to the impact of a 687 million benefit which includes the release of uncertain tax position reserves from 2009 offset by taiwan surtax expense due to this reserve release excluding these items we would have reported an effective tax rate of 168 for fiscal year 2013 compared to 131 for fiscal year 2012 this increase was primarily driven by an unfavorable income mix across tax jurisdictions reduced taiwanese tax incentives and the release of other uncertain tax position reserves amounting to approximately 112 million for 2013 and 130 million for 2012 that are considered immaterial tend to be more recurring in nature and are comparable between periods   these factors were partially offset by the impact of 63 million of research and development tax credits related to 2012 which were recognized when the related legislation was enacted in january 2013 

  

management believes that the effective tax rate for fiscal 2014 will be consistent with the 2013 effective tax rate of 168 excluding special items as outlined above as operating profits and margins are relatively stable the actual effective tax rate will depend upon the operating margins production volume additional capital investments made during fiscal 2014 the resolution of uncertain tax positions and the composition of our earnings

comparison of 52weeks ended december 28 2013 and december 29 2012 

  

net sales 

  

 

  

  net sales decreased 3 in 2013 when compared to the yearago period   the decrease was driven by the automotivemobile segment which posted a 13 decline with offsetting growth in outdoor fitness marine and aviation   automotivemobile revenue remains the largest portion of our revenue mix at 49 in 2013 compared to 55 in 2012   

  

total unit sales decreased 10 to 139 million units in 2013 from 154 million units in 2012   the decrease in unit sales volume was attributable to reduced automotivemobile volumes due to penetration rates and competing technologies   this decline was partially offset by growth in each of the other segments   

  

  automotivemobile segment revenue decreased 13 from the yearago period as volumes decreased 17 partially offset by average selling price asp improvement due to the amortization of previously deferred revenue exceeding current year revenue deferrals in 2013 and increased auto oem contribution with a higher asp   

  

  aviation revenues increased 16 from the yearago period as the oem market improved in some aircraft categories as well as contribution from recent share gains and aftermarket products   fitness revenues increased 11 on the strength of our cycling products power meter and the forerunner 10 with strong volume growth partially offset by reduced asps associated with the forerunner 10 revenues in our marine segment increased 7 as new product introductions were partially offset by a weak first quarter when we discounted many products in advance of new products and a global marine electronics industry that continues to be weak due to macroeconomic instability   

  

the company anticipates revenue of 26  27 billion in 2014 driven by growth in the outdoor fitness aviation and marine segments offset by ongoing declines in the automotivemobile segment   in general management believes that continuous innovation and the introduction of new products are essential for future revenue growth 

  

cost of goods sold  

  

 

cost of goods sold decreased 4 when compared to the year ago period   as a percentage of revenue cost of goods sold decreased 50 basis points from the year ago period   cost of goods as a percentage of revenue for outdoor and fitness were negatively impacted by product mix and slight asp declines   cost of goods as a percentage of revenues increased by 850 basis points in marine due to significant pricing discounts on legacy inventory in the first half of 2013 competitive pricing dynamics on new products and rising component costs   the automotivemobile segment recorded a 13 decline in cost of goods in absolute dollars as revenues declined 13   cost of goods as a percentage of revenues for the automotivemobile segment decreased by 30 basis points as the effect of a 21 million onetime royalty fee benefit related to license fee overpayments recorded in the second quarter of 2012 was offset by the benefit from the amortization of previously deferred high margin revenue and the associated costs exceeding new deferrals on current period sales in 2013   the aviation segment experienced an absolute dollar cost of goods sold increase generally commensurate with the sales increase discussed above 

  

management believes that cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales will be relatively stable in 2014 given the growth in segments with higher margin profiles than corporate average product mix within those segments and current component pricing   

  

gross profit  

  

  gross profit dollars in 2013 decreased 2 while gross profit margin increased 50 basis points compared to 2012 driven primarily by the automotivemobile and aviation segments   the automotivemobile gross margin was stable at 43 as the royalty benefit recorded in the second quarter of 2012 was offset by increased amortization of previously deferred high margin revenues in 2013 as discussed above   the gross profit margin percentage for the marine segment declined by 850 basis points as discussed above   

  management believes that total company gross margins will be relatively stable in 2014 as discussed above   

  advertising expenses    

  

advertising expense decreased 19 in absolute dollars and 80 basis points as a percent of revenue compared to the yearago period   the decrease occurred primarily in the automotivemobile and marine segments due to reduced cooperative advertising associated with lower volumes in automotivemobile and a newer product line in marine requiring less promotional activity   

  

management expects to increase advertising as a percentage of sales in 2014 with incremental spending associated with new product categories partially offset by decreased spending in the automotivemobile segment 

 

selling general and administrative expenses   

 

  

  selling general and administrative expense decreased 4 in absolute dollars and 10 basis points as a percent of revenues compared to the yearago period   the absolute dollar decrease is primarily related to reduced legal settlements and legal fees in the automotivemobile segment the increase in aviation is partially related to an increase in bad debt expense   variances by segment are primarily due to the allocation of certain selling general and administrative expenses based on percentage of total revenues 

  

management expects selling general and administrative expenses to be relatively stable as a percentage of sales in 2014 

  

research and development expense 

  

 

  

  research and development expense increased 12 due to ongoing development activities for new products and the addition of over 200 new engineering personnel to our staff since 2012   in absolute dollars research and development costs increased 392 million when compared with 2012 representing a 190 basis point increase as a percent of revenue   aviation had the largest increase in absolute dollars as we are investing heavily in oem opportunities   marine and automotivemobile investment is focused on marine product enhancements and automotive oem opportunities respectively   within outdoor and fitness we launched a number of new product categories in 2013   we are also exploring new categories within these segments 

  

management believes that one of the key strategic initiatives for future growth and success of garmin is continuous innovation development and introduction of new products   management expects that its research and development expenses will increase during fiscal 2014 on an absolute dollar basis and as a percent of revenue in order to deliver innovative new products and technologies 

  

operating income 

  

 

 

operating income decreased 5 in absolute dollars and 40 basis points as a percent of revenue when compared to 2012 due to declining revenues and increased research and development expense offset by a slight improvement in gross margins and cost reductions in advertising and selling general and administrative expenses as discussed above 

  

other income expense 

  

 

  

other income expense principally consists of interest income and foreign currency exchange gains and losses   interest income for fiscal 2013 increased slightly due to increasing cash and marketable securities balances during the year   

  

foreign currency gains and losses for the company are primarily tied to movements by the taiwan dollar the euro and the british pound sterling in relation to the us dollar   the taiwan dollar is the functional currency of garmin corporation   the us dollar remains the functional currency of garmin europe ltd   the euro is the functional currency of most european subsidiaries   as these entities have grown currency fluctuations can generate material gains and losses   additionally eurobased intercompany transactions can also generate currency gains and losses   due to the relative size of the entities using a functional currency other than the taiwan dollar the euro and the british pound sterling currency fluctuations related to these entities are not expected to have a material impact on the company’s financial statements 

  

the majority of the 355 million currency gain in 2013 was due to the strengthening of the us dollar compared to the taiwan dollar   the weakening of the us dollar compared to the euro and british pound sterling contributed additional gains   the movements of the taiwan dollar and eurobritish pound sterling have offsetting impacts due to the use of the taiwan dollar for manufacturing costs and cash held in nonfunctional currency while the euro and british pound sterling transactions relate to revenue   during 2013 the us dollar weakened 41 and 22 respectively relative to the euro and british pound sterling resulting in a foreign currency gain of 75 million in garmin ltd and our european subsidiaries the us dollar strengthened 33 against the taiwan dollar resulting in a 302 million foreign currency gain due to the fluctuation of asset balances throughout the year the net result of these currency moves combined with other losses of 21 million and the timing of transactions during the year was a net gain of 355 million for the company 

  

the 200 million currency loss in 2012 was due primarily to weakening of the us dollar compared to the taiwan dollar during 2012 the us dollar weakened 38 compared to the taiwan dollar resulting in a loss of 313 million   this was partially offset by the us dollar weakening 21 and 43 respectively compared to the euro and the british pound sterling resulting in a 104 million gain   the remaining net currency gain of 08 million is related to other currencies and timing of transactions 

  

income tax provision 

  our earnings before taxes increased 5 when compared to 2012 while our income tax expense decreased by 410 million to 411 million for 2013 compared to 821 million for 2012   the significant decline was due to the impact of a 687 million benefit which includes the release of uncertain tax position reserves from 2009 offset by taiwan surtax expense due to this reserve release excluding these items we would have reported an effective tax rate of 168 for fiscal year 2013 compared to 131 for fiscal year 2012 this increase was primarily driven by an unfavorable income mix across tax jurisdictions reduced taiwanese tax incentives and the release of other uncertain tax position reserves amounting to approximately 112 million for 2013 and 130 million for 2012 that are considered immaterial tend to be more recurring in nature and are comparable between periods   these factors were partially offset by the impact of 63 million of research and development tax credits related to 2012 which were recognized when the related legislation was enacted in january 2013 

 

net income 

  

as a result of the various factors noted above net income increased 13 to 6124 million for fiscal year 2013 compared to 5424 million for fiscal year 2012 

  

comparison of 52weeks ended december 29 2012 and 53weeks ended december 31 2011 

  

net sales 

  

 

  

  net sales decreased 2 in 2012 when compared to the yearago period the decrease was driven by automotivemobile and marine with offsetting growth in outdoor fitness and aviation the outdoor segment experienced the greatest increase at 11 with fitness contributing 8 growth automotivemobile revenue remains the largest portion of our revenue mix but declined from 58 in 2011 to 55 in 2012 

  

total unit sales decreased 3 to 154 million units in 2012 from 158 million units in 2011 the declining unit sales volume in 2012 was primarily attributable to a decline in automotivemobile units as the north american and european pnd markets slowed due to penetration rates and competing technologies   this decline was partially offset by increasing volumes in the outdoor and fitness segments as well as auto oem units 

  

automotivemobile segment revenue declined 6 in 2012 as the average selling price asp was flat and volumes declined 6 asp was stable due to the substantial increase in our bundled product offerings which include lifetime map updates and premium traffic services as a percentage of total units sold offset by a decrease in the asp of comparable models from the previous year   the increase in product mix toward bundled offerings required us to defer 683 million of net sales in 2012 compared to 1793 million of net sales in 2011 the reduced impact of deferred revenue is related to increased amortization of previously deferred revenues and costs and a reduced per unit revenue deferral rate due to a change in accounting estimate in the third quarter of 2011 as previously discussed offset by the impact of increased sales of bundled units requiring deferral   

  

outdoor revenue increased 11 driven by market share gains in the gpsenabled golf category and the dog tracking and training portfolio including the benefit of an acquisition completed in the second half of 2011   fitness segment revenue increased 8 on the strength of recent product introductions and ongoing global penetration though slowing from 24 growth in the prior year when we had significant promotional activity on discontinued products marine revenues decreased 6 due to a difficult international marine environment aviation revenues increased 2 as the company’s oem business began to recover but was partially offset by declining sales of retrofit and portable products 

 

cost of goods sold    

  

cost of goods sold decreased 10 in 2012 when compared to the yearago period primarily due to unit volume declines discussed above component cost reductions a mix shift toward higher margin new products and certain factors specific to the automotivemobile segment discussed below   the cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenues for the automotivemobile segment decreased by 560 basis points   the decline principally resulted from a 21 million onetime royalty fee benefit recorded in second quarter 140 basis points and subsequent impact of reduced royalty costs a reduction in the yearoveryear impact of deferred revenue and costs including the reduced per unit deferral rate as discussed above 280 basis points component price reductions and product mix shifting toward more recently introduced products carrying a higher margin profile   

  

fitness and marine posted declines in cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenue due to product mix moving toward newer products with increased features functionality and higher per unit margins as well as decreased promotional activities   aviation posted a decline in cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenue due primarily to product mix and a prior year oem contribution that negatively impacted revenues 

  

gross profit   

 

  

  gross profit dollars in 2012 increased 7 while gross profit margin percentage increased 450 basis points compared to 2011 gross profit margins increased in all segments excluding outdoor when compared to 2011 

  

the automotivemobile segment gross profit margin percentage increased 560 basis points driven primarily by the onetime royalty fee adjustment a 90 million reduction in the yearoveryear impact of deferred revenue and cost including the reduced per unit deferral rate partially offset by the impact of increased sales of bundled units requiring deferral reduced component pricing and improved product mix as discussed above   

  

fitness and marine gross profit margin percentage increased 260 basis points and 170 basis points respectively from the prior year driven primarily by product mix improvement and less promotional activity in the current year as discussed above   aviation gross profit margin percentage increased 320 basis points driven primarily by product mix and a prior year oem contribution as discussed above 

 

advertising expenses   

 

  

advertising expense decreased in absolute dollars and was flat as a percentage of revenues when compared to 2011 the decrease in absolute dollars resulted from reduced cooperative advertising on lower sales in the pnd category partially offset by increased cooperative advertising and media placement within the outdoor fitness and marine segments 

  selling general and administrative expenses   

 

  

selling general and administrative expense increased in both absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues compared to 2011 as a percent of revenues selling general and administrative expenses increased 120 basis points in 2012 the expense increase was primarily driven by full year expense for acquisitions completed in the second half of 2011 which added almost 20 million and increased legal costs and reserves partially offset by a reduction in bad debt expense and commissions expense 

  

research and development expense 

  

 

  

  research and development expense increased 9 due to ongoing development activities for new products and the addition of over 375 new engineering personnel with an emphasis on oem opportunities within aviation auto and marine in absolute dollars research and development costs increased 272 million when compared with the yearago period and increased 120 basis points as a percent of revenue 

 

operating income 

  

 

  

operating income increased 210 basis points as a percent of revenue and 9 in absolute dollars when compared to the yearago period as gross margin improvement was only partially offset by increased operating expenses 

  

other income expense 

  

 

  

other income expense principally consists of interest income and foreign currency exchange gains and losses   interest income for fiscal 2012 increased due to increasing cash and marketable securities balances during the year offset by a slight decline in interest rates   

  

the 200 million currency loss in 2012 was due primarily to weakening of the us dollar compared to the taiwan dollar the movements of the taiwan dollar and eurobritish pound sterling have offsetting impacts due to the use of the taiwan dollar for manufacturing costs and cash held in nonfunctional currency while the euro and british pound sterling transactions relate to revenue   during 2012 the us dollar weakened 38 compared to the taiwan dollar resulting in a loss of 313 million   this was partially offset by the us dollar weakening 21 and 43 respectively compared to the euro and the british pound sterling resulting in a 104 million gain   the remaining net currency gain of 08 million is related to other currencies and timing of transactions 

  

the 121 million currency loss in 2011 was due primarily to the strengthening of the us dollar compared to the euro   during 2011 the us dollar strengthened 13 compared to the euro resulting in a loss of 48 million   a loss of 41 million resulted due to the us dollar weakening 12 against the taiwan dollar as the asset balances fluctuated throughout the year   the remaining net currency loss of 32 million is related to other currencies and timing of transactions 

  

income tax provision 

  our earnings before taxes increased 7 when compared to 2011 while our income tax expense increased by 30 to 821 million compared to 633 million for fiscal year 2011   the significant increase in income tax expense was primarily due to a decrease in the income eligible for tax holiday in taiwan unfavorable income mix toward higher tax jurisdictions and an increase in uncertain tax position reserves net of amounts released due to expiration of statutes of limitations and the impact of no research and development credit in 2012 

  

net income 

  

as a result of the various factors noted above net income increased 4 to 5424 million for fiscal year 2012 compared to 5209 million for fiscal year 2011 

 

liquidity and capital resources 

  

operating activities 

  

 

  

  the 547 million decrease in cash provided by operating activities in fiscal year 2013 compared to fiscal year 2012 was primarily due to the following 

  

        

partially offset by 

  

      

  the 1376 million decrease in cash provided by operating activities in fiscal year 2012 compared to fiscal year 2011 was primarily due to the following 

  

   

 

partially offset by 

      

we expect to generate 550  600 million of cash flow from operations in 2014 with ongoing net income 

  

investing activities 

  

 

  

the 2218 million decrease in cash used in investing activities in fiscal year 2013 compared to fiscal year 2012 was primarily due to the following 

  

   

partially offset by 

  

    

the 80 million increase in cash used in investing activities in fiscal year 2012 compared to fiscal year 2011 was primarily due to the following 

  

   

partially offset by 

  

   

  we have budgeted approximately 50 million of capital expenditures during fiscal 2014 to include normal ongoing capital expenditures and maintenance activities   it is management’s goal to invest the onhand cash consistent with garmin’s investment policy which has been approved by the board of directors   the investment policy’s primary purpose is to preserve capital maintain an acceptable degree of liquidity and maximize yield within the constraint of low credit risk   garmin’s average return on cash and investments during fiscal 2013 2012 and 2011 were approximately 14 14 and 16 respectively 

  

  the fair value of our securities varies from period to period due to changes in interest rates in the performance of the underlying collateral and in the credit performance of the underlying issuer among other factors   in 2013 garmin experienced unrealized noncash losses on its investment portfolio resulting in a balance of 57356 of gross otherthantemporary impairment and 4377 of other unrealized losses on marketable securities at december 28 2013   the amortized cost and estimated fair value of the securities at an unrealized loss position at december 28 2013 were 1215498 and 1153765 respectively   this decrease in estimated fair value is primarily due to market valuations on mortgagebacked securities and obligations of states and political subdivisions declining the decline was due to increases in the 10 year treasury bond yield during 2013 which caused market valuations of securities in our investment portfolios to decline   approximately 50 of securities in our portfolio were at an unrealized loss position at december 28 2013   an immaterial amount of those securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position for 12 months or longer   we have the ability to hold these securities until maturity or their value is recovered   we do not consider these unrealized losses to be other than temporary credit losses because there has been no deterioration in credit quality and no change in the cash flows of the underlying securities   we do not intend to sell the securities and it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the securities therefore no impairment has been recorded in the accompanying condensed consolidated statement of income 

 

financing activities 

  

 

  

the 1570 million increase in cash used in financing activities in fiscal year 2013 compared to fiscal year 2012 was primarily due to the following 

  

    

the 576 million decrease in cash used in financing activities in fiscal year 2012 compared to fiscal year 2011 was primarily due to the following 

  

   

our dividend has progressively increased from 040 per share for the four calendar quarters beginning in june 2011 to 045 per share for the four calendar quarters beginning in june 2012 through december 2013 

  

  we currently use cash flow from operations to fund our capital expenditures to support our working capital requirements and to pay dividends   we expect that future cash requirements will principally be for capital expenditures working capital payment of dividends declared share repurchases and the funding of strategic acquisitions   we believe that our existing cash balances and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our longterm projected capital expenditures working capital and other cash requirements 

  

contractual obligations and commercial commitments 

  

  future commitments of garmin as of december 28 2013 aggregated by type of contractual obligation are 

  

 

  

the company is a party to certain commitments which includes raw materials advertising and other indirect purchases in connection with conducting our business pursuant to these agreements the company is contractually committed to make purchases of approximately 2256 million over the next five years 

 

we may be required to make significant cash outlays related to unrecognized tax benefits   however due to the uncertainty of the timing of future cash flows associated with our unrecognized tax benefits we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement if any with the respective taxing authorities   accordingly unrecognized tax benefits of 1330 million as of december 28 2013 have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above   for further information related to unrecognized tax benefits see note 2 “income taxes” to the consolidated financial statements included in this report 

  

offbalance sheet arrangements 

  

  we do not have any offbalance sheet arrangements 

  




 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

  market sensitivity   

  we have market risk primarily in connection with the pricing of our products and services and the purchase of raw materials   product pricing and raw materials costs are both significantly influenced by semiconductor market conditions   historically during cyclical industry downturns we have been able to offset pricing declines for our products through a combination of improved product mix and success in obtaining price reductions in raw materials costs 

  

inflation 

  

  we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our business financial condition or results of operations   if our costs were to become subject to significant inflationary pressures we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs through price increases   our inability or failure to do so could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

  

the operation of garmin’s subsidiaries in international markets results in exposure to movements in currency exchange rates   we have experienced significant foreign currency gains and losses due to the strengthening and weakening of the us dollar   the potential of volatile foreign exchange rate fluctuations in the future could have a significant effect on our results of operations 

  

  the currencies that create a majority of the company’s exchange rate exposure are the taiwan dollar euro and british pound sterling   garmin corporation headquartered in sijhih taiwan uses the local currency as the functional currency   the company translates all assets and liabilities at yearend exchange rates and income and expense accounts at average rates during the year   in order to minimize the effect of the currency exchange fluctuations on our net assets we have elected to retain most of our taiwan subsidiary’s cash and investments in marketable securities denominated in us dollars   

  

most european subsidiaries use the euro as the functional currency    the functional currency of our largest european subsidiary garmin europe ltd remains the us dollar and as some transactions occurred in british pounds sterling or euros foreign currency gains or losses have been realized historically related to the movements of those currencies relative to the us dollar   the company believes that gains and losses will become more material in the future as our european presence grows   in 2013 the us dollar weakened 41 and 22 respectively relative to the euro and british pound sterling resulting in a foreign currency gain of 75 million in garmin ltd and our european subsidiaries the us dollar strengthened 33 against the taiwan dollar resulting in a 302 million foreign currency gain due to the fluctuation of asset balances throughout the year the net result of these currency moves combined with other losses of 21 million and the timing of transactions during the year was a net gain of 355 million for the company and a cumulative translation adjustment of 436 million at the end of fiscal 2013 

 

interest rate risk 

  

we have no outstanding longterm debt as of december 28 2013   we therefore have no meaningful debtrelated interest rate risk   

  

we are exposed to interest rate risk in connection with our investments in marketable securities   as interest rates change the unrealized gains and losses associated with those securities will fluctuate accordingly   

  

the fair value of our securities varies from period to period due to changes in interest rates in the performance of the underlying collateral and in the credit performance of the underlying issuer among other factors   in 2013 garmin experienced unrealized noncash losses on its investment portfolio resulting in a balance of 57356 of gross otherthantemporary impairment and 4377 of other unrealized losses on marketable securities at december 28 2013   the amortized cost and estimated fair value of the securities at an unrealized loss position at december 28 2013 were 1215498 and 1153765 respectively   this decrease in estimated fair value is primarily due to market valuations on mortgagebacked securities and obligations of states and political subdivisions declining the decline was due to increases in the 10 year treasury bond yield during 2013 which caused market valuations of securities in our investment portfolios to decline   approximately 50 of securities in our portfolio were at an unrealized loss position at december 28 2013   an immaterial amount of those securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position for 12 months or longer   we have the ability to hold these securities until maturity or their value is recovered   we do not consider these unrealized losses to be other than temporary credit losses because there has been no deterioration in credit quality and no change in the cash flows of the underlying securities   we do not intend to sell the securities and it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the securities therefore no impairment has been recorded in the accompanying condensed consolidated statement of income

 item 1a risk factors 

  

the risks described below are not the only ones facing our company additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also impair our business operations if any of the following risks occur our business financial condition or operating results could be materially adversely affected 

  





  

risks related to the company 

  

the demand for personal navigation devices pnds has been reduced by replacement technologies becoming available on mobile handsets and factoryinstalled systems in new autos 

 

from 2005 to 2008 we experienced substantial growth in the automotivemobile segment this has resulted in gpsnavigation technologies being incorporated into competing devices such as mobile handsets and new automobiles through factoryinstalled systems mobile handsets are frequently gpsenabled and many companies are now offering navigation software for mobile devices the acceptance of this technology by consumers has halted our growth in this segment and reduced margins navigation systems are also becoming more prevalent as optional equipment on new automobiles increased navigation penetration on mobile handsets and in new automobiles could cause further declines in sales of our portable navigation devices and further reduced margins

 

our financial results are highly dependent on the automotivemobile segment which represents approximately 55 of our revenues is maturing and expected to further decline in 2013 

  

we have historically experienced substantial growth in the automotivemobile segment of our business as the products have become massmarket consumer electronics in both europe and north america this market has peaked as penetration rates increase and competing technologies emerge this has resulted in and could continue to result in lower revenues and lower earnings per share

 

economic conditions and uncertainty could adversely affect our revenue and margins 

  

our revenue and margins depend significantly on general economic conditions and the demand for products in the markets in which we compete the current economic weakness and constrained consumer and business spending has resulted in decreased revenue and in the future could result in decreased revenue and problems with our ability to manage inventory levels and collect customer receivables in addition financial difficulties experienced by our retailer and oem customers have resulted and could result in the future in significant bad debt writeoffs and additions to reserves in our receivables and could have an adverse affect on our results of operations

  

gross margins for our products may fluctuate or erode 

  

gross margins on our automotivemobile products have declined and could further decline in the future due to price reductions in the competitive market for navigation solutions that are not fully offset by material cost reductions in addition our overall gross margin may fluctuate from period to period due to a number of factors including product mix competition and unit volumes in particular the average selling prices of a specific product tend to decrease over that product’s life to offset such decreases we intend to rely primarily on component cost reduction obtaining yield improvements and corresponding cost reductions in the manufacture of existing products and on introducing new products that incorporate advanced features and therefore can be sold at higher average selling prices however there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain any such yield improvements or cost reductions or introduce any such new products in the future to the extent that such cost reductions and new product introductions do not occur in a timely manner or our products do not achieve market acceptance our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected

  

changes in our united states federal income tax classification or in applicable tax law could result in adverse tax consequences to our shareholders 

 

we do not believe that we or any of our nonunited states subsidiaries are currently a ‘‘passive foreign investment company’’ for united states federal income tax purposes we do not expect to become a passive foreign investment company however because the passive foreign investment company determination is made annually based on whether the company’s income or assets meet certain thresholds as determined under united states federal tax principles which are based on facts and circumstances that may be beyond our control we cannot assure that we will not become a passive foreign investment company in the future if we are a passive foreign investment company in any year then any of our shareholders that is a united states person could be liable to pay tax on their pro rata share of our income plus an interest charge upon some distributions by us or when that shareholder sells our common shares at a gain further if we are classified as a passive foreign investment company in any year in which a united states person is a shareholder we generally will continue to be treated as a passive foreign investment company with respect to such shareholder in all succeeding years regardless of whether we continue to satisfy the income or asset tests mentioned above

 





 

we do not believe that we or any of our nonunited states subsidiaries are currently a controlled foreign corporation cfc for united states federal income tax purposes we do not expect to become a cfc the cfc determination is made daily based on whether the united states shareholders own more than fifty percent of the voting power or value of the company only united states persons that own ten percent or more of the voting power of the company’s shares qualify as united states shareholders if the company were to be classified as a cfc for an uninterrupted thirty day period in any year the company’s shareholders that qualify as united states shareholders could be liable to pay us income tax at ordinary income tax rates on their prorata share of certain categories of the company’s income for the period in which the company is classified as a cfc as the company cannot control the ownership of the company’s stock nor can the company control which shareholders participate in the company’s stock buyback program ownership changes could result that create united states shareholders which increase the risk of garmin being treated as a cfc

 

legislative proposals have been considered in the united states within the past few years that could increase the united states tax burden of corporations with international operations and could broaden the circumstances under which foreign corporations could be considered resident in the united states our tax position could be adversely impacted by changes in united states or foreign tax laws tax treaties or tax regulations or the interpretation or enforcement thereof by any tax authority we cannot predict the outcome of any specific legislative proposals

 

if we are not successful in the continued development introduction or timely manufacture of new products demand for our products could decrease 

  

we expect that a significant portion of our future revenue will continue to be derived from sales of newly introduced products the market for our products is characterized by rapidly changing technology evolving industry standards and changes in customer needs if we fail to introduce new products or to modify or improve our existing products in response to changes in technology industry standards or customer needs our products could rapidly become less competitive or obsolete we must continue to make significant investments in research and development in order to continue to develop new products enhance existing products and achieve market acceptance for such products however there can be no assurance that development stage products will be successfully completed or if developed will achieve significant customer acceptance

 

if we are unable to successfully develop and introduce competitive new products and enhance our existing products our future results of operations would be adversely affected our pursuit of necessary technology may require substantial time and expense we may need to license new technologies to respond to technological change these licenses may not be available to us on terms that we can accept or may materially change the gross profits that we are able to obtain on our products we may not succeed in adapting our products to new technologies as they emerge development and manufacturing schedules for technology products are difficult to predict and there can be no assurance that we will achieve timely initial customer shipments of new products the timely availability of these products in volume and their acceptance by customers are important to our future success from time to time we have experienced delays in shipping certain of our new products and any future delays whether due to product development delays manufacturing delays lack of market acceptance delays in regulatory approval or otherwise could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations

  





  

if we are unable to compete effectively with existing or new competitors our resulting loss of competitive position could result in price reductions fewer customer orders reduced margins and loss of market share 

  

the markets for many of our products are highly competitive and we expect competition to increase in the future some of our competitors have significantly greater financial technical and marketing resources than we do these competitors may be able to respond more rapidly to new or emerging technologies or changes in customer requirements they may also be able to devote greater resources to the development promotion and sale of their products increased competition could result in price reductions fewer customer orders reduced margins and loss of market share our failure to compete successfully against current or future competitors could seriously harm our business financial condition and results of operations

  

we rely on independent dealers and distributors to sell our products and disruption to these channels would harm our business 

  

because we sell a majority of our products to independent dealers and distributors we are subject to many risks including risks related to their inventory levels and support for our products in particular our dealers and distributors maintain significant levels of our products in their inventories if dealers and distributors attempt to reduce their levels of inventory or if they do not maintain sufficient levels to meet customer demand our sales could be negatively impacted

 

many of our dealers and distributors also sell products offered by our competitors if our competitors offer our dealers and distributors more favorable terms those dealers and distributors may deemphasize or decline to carry our products in the future we may not be able to retain or attract a sufficient number of qualified dealers and distributors if we are unable to maintain successful relationships with dealers and distributors or to expand our distribution channels our business will suffer

  

our quarterly operating results are subject to fluctuations and seasonality 

  

our operating results are difficult to predict our future quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly if such operating results decline the price of our stock would likely decline as we have expanded our operations our operating expenses particularly our selling general and administrative and research and development costs have increased as a percentage of our sales if revenues decrease and we are unable to reduce those costs rapidly our operating results would be negatively affected

 

historically our revenues have been weaker in the first quarter of each fiscal year as our devices are highly consumeroriented and consumer buying is traditionally lower in this quarter sales of certain of our marine and automotive products tend to be higher in our second fiscal quarter due to increased consumer spending for such products during the recreational marine fishing and travel season sales of many of our consumer products also have been higher in our fourth fiscal quarter due to increased consumer spending patterns on electronic devices during the holiday season in addition we attempt to time our new product releases to coincide with relatively higher consumer spending in the second and fourth fiscal quarters which contributes to these seasonal variations

  

our quarterly financial statements will reflect fluctuations in foreign currency translation 

 

the operation of garmin’s subsidiaries in international markets results in exposure to movements in currency exchange rates we have experienced significant foreign currency gains and losses due to the strengthening and weakening of the us dollar the potential of volatile foreign exchange rate fluctuations in the future could have a significant effect on our results of operations

 

the currencies that create a majority of the company’s exchange rate exposure are the taiwan dollar euro and british pound sterling garmin corporation headquartered in sijhih taiwan uses the local currency as the functional currency the company translates all assets and liabilities at yearend exchange rates and income and expense accounts at average rates during the year in order to minimize the effect of the currency exchange fluctuations on our net assets we have elected to retain most of our taiwan subsidiary’s cash and investments in marketable securities denominated in us dollars

 





 

nonetheless us gaap requires the company at the end of each accounting period to translate into taiwan dollars all such us dollar denominated assets held by our taiwan subsidiary this translation is required because the taiwan dollar is the functional currency of the subsidiary this us gaapmandated translation will cause us to recognize gain or loss on our financial statements as the taiwan dollarus dollar exchange rate varies such gain or loss will create variations in our earnings per share because there is minimal cash impact caused by such exchange rate variations management will continue to focus on the company’s operating performance before the impact of the foreign currency translation

 

if we do not correctly anticipate demand for our products we may not be able to secure sufficient quantities or costeffective production of our products or we could have costly excess production or inventories 

  

we have generally been able to increase production to meet this increasing demand however the demand for our products depends on many factors and will be difficult to forecast we expect that it will become more difficult to forecast demand as we introduce and support multiple products as competition in the market for our products intensifies and as the markets for some of our products mature to the mass market category significant unanticipated fluctuations in demand could cause the following problems in our operations

 

  

  

  

we have benefited in the past from taiwan government tax incentives offered on certain high technology capital investments that may not always be available 

  

our effective tax rate is lower than the us federal statutory rate in part because we have benefited from incentives offered in taiwan related to our high technology investments in taiwan the loss of these tax benefits could have a significant effect on our financial results in the future

 

we may experience unique economic and political risks associated with companies that operate in taiwan 

  

relations between taiwan and the people’s republic of china also referred to as the prc and other factors affecting the political or economic conditions of taiwan in the future could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations and the market price and the liquidity of our shares our principal manufacturing facilities where we manufacture all of our products except our panelmounted aviation products are located in taiwan

 

taiwan has a unique international political status the prc asserts sovereignty over all of china including taiwan certain other islands and all of mainland china the prc government does not recognize the legitimacy of the taiwan government although significant economic and cultural relations have been established during recent years between taiwan and the prc the prc government has indicated that it may use military force to gain control over taiwan in certain circumstances such as the declaration of independence by taiwan relations between taiwan and the prc have on occasion adversely affected the market value of taiwanese companies and could negatively affect our operations in taiwan in the future

 





 

our intellectual property rights are important to our operations and we could suffer loss if they infringe upon other’s rights or are infringed upon by others 

  

we rely on a combination of patents copyrights trademarks and trade secrets confidentiality provisions and licensing arrangements to establish and protect our proprietary rights to this end we hold rights to a number of patents and registered trademarks and regularly file applications to attempt to protect our rights in new technology and trademarks however there is no guarantee that our patent applications will become issued patents or that our trademark applications will become registered trademarks moreover even if approved our patents or trademarks may thereafter be successfully challenged by others or otherwise become invalidated for a variety of reasons thus any patents or trademarks we currently have or may later acquire may not provide us a significant competitive advantage

 

third parties may claim that we are infringing their intellectual property rights such claims could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition from time to time we receive letters alleging infringement of patents trademarks or other intellectual property rights litigation concerning patents or other intellectual property is costly and time consuming we may seek licenses from such parties but they could refuse to grant us a license or demand commercially unreasonable terms we might not have sufficient resources to pay for the licenses such infringement claims could also cause us to incur substantial liabilities and to suspend or permanently cease the use of critical technologies or processes or the production or sale of major products

 

we may become subject to significant product liability costs 

  

if our aviation products malfunction or contain errors or defects airplane collisions or crashes could occur resulting in property damage personal injury or death malfunctions or errors or defects in our marine navigational products could cause boats to run aground or cause other wreckage personal injury or death if our automotive or marine products contain defects or errors in the mapping supplied by thirdparty map providers or if our users do not heed our warnings about the proper use of these products collisions or accidents could occur resulting in property damage personal injury or death if any of these events occurs we could be subject to significant liability for personal injury and property damage and under certain circumstances could be subject to a judgment for punitive damages we maintain insurance against accidentrelated risks involving our products however there can be no assurance that such insurance would be sufficient to cover the cost of damages to others or that such insurance will continue to be available at commercially reasonable rates in addition insurance coverage generally will not cover awards of punitive damages and may not cover the cost of associated legal fees and defense costs which could result in lower margins if we are unable to maintain sufficient insurance to cover product liability costs or if our insurance coverage does not cover the award this could have a materially adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations

 

we depend on our suppliers some of which are the sole source for specific components and our production would be seriously harmed if these suppliers are not able to meet our demand and alternative sources are not available or if the costs of components rise 

  

we are dependent on third party suppliers for various components used in our current products some of the components that we procure from third party suppliers include semiconductors and electroluminescent panels liquid crystal displays memory chips batteries and microprocessors the cost quality and availability of components are essential to the successful production and sale of our products some components we use are from sole source suppliers certain applicationspecific integrated circuits incorporating our proprietary designs are manufactured for us by sole source suppliers alternative sources may not be currently available for these sole source components

 

in the past we have experienced shortages of liquid crystal displays and other components in addition if there are shortages in supply of components the costs of such components may rise if suppliers are unable to meet our demand for components on a timely basis and if we are unable to obtain an alternative source or if the price of the alternative source is prohibitive or if the costs of components rise our ability to maintain timely and costeffective production of our products would be seriously harmed

 





  

we depend on third party licensors for the digital map data contained in our automotivemobile products and our business andor gross margins could be harmed if we become unable to continue licensing such mapping data or if the royalty costs for such data rise 

 

we license digital mapping data for use in our products from various sources there are only a limited number of suppliers of mapping data for each geographical region the two largest digital map suppliers are navteq corporation and tele atlas nv navteq corporation is owned by nokia oyj and tele atlas nv is owned by tomtom nv nokia and tomtom are both competitors of garmin

 

although we do not foresee difficulty in continuing to license data at favorable pricing due to the long term license extension signed between garmin and navteq in november 2007 extending our navteq license agreement through 2017 with an option to extend through 2021 if we are unable to continue licensing such mapping data and are unable to obtain an alternative source or if the nature of our relationships with navteq changes detrimentally our ability to supply mapping data for use in our products would be seriously harmed

  

we may pursue strategic acquisitions investments strategic partnerships or other ventures and our business could be materially harmed if we fail to successfully identify complete and integrate such transactions 

  

we intend to evaluate acquisition opportunities and opportunities to make investments in complementary businesses technologies services or products or to enter into strategic partnerships with parties who can provide access to those assets additional product or services offerings additional distribution or marketing synergies or additional industry expertise we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition investment or strategic partnership candidates or if we do identify suitable candidates in the future we may not be able to complete those transactions on commercially favorable terms or at all

 

any past or future acquisitions could also result in difficulties assimilating acquired employees including cultural differences with foreign acquisitions operations and products and diversion of capital and management’s attention away from other business issues and opportunities integration of acquired companies may result in problems related to integration of technology and inexperienced management teams in addition the key personnel of the acquired company may decide not to work for us we may not successfully integrate internal controls compliance under the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 and other corporate governance matters operations personnel or products related to acquisitions we have made in previous years or may make in the future if we fail to successfully integrate such transactions our business could be materially harmed

 

we may have additional tax liabilities 

  

we are subject to income taxes in switzerland the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes in the ordinary course of our business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain we are regularly under audit by tax authorities although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals the results of an audit or litigation could have a material effect on our income tax provision net income or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made

 





 

failure to obtain required certifications of our products on a timely basis could harm our business 

  

we have certain products especially in our aviation segment that are subject to governmental and similar certifications before they can be sold for example faa certification is required for all of our aviation products that are intended for installation in type certificated aircraft to the extent required certification is an expensive and timeconsuming process that requires significant focus and resources an inability to obtain or excessive delay in obtaining such certifications could have an adverse effect on our ability to introduce new products and for certain aviation oem products our customers’ ability to sell airplanes therefore such inabilities or delays could adversely affect our operating results in addition we cannot assure you that our certified products will not be decertified any such decertification could have an adverse effect on our operating results

 

our business may suffer if we are not able to hire and retain sufficient qualified personnel or if we lose our key personnel 

  

our future success depends partly on the continued contribution of our key executive engineering sales marketing manufacturing and administrative personnel we currently do not have employment agreements with any of our key executive officers we do not have key man life insurance on any of our key executive officers and do not currently intend to obtain such insurance the loss of the services of any of our senior level management or other key employees could harm our business recruiting and retaining the skilled personnel we require to maintain and grow our market position may be difficult for example in some recent years there has been a nationwide shortage of qualified electrical engineers and software engineers who are necessary for us to design and develop new products and therefore it has sometimes been challenging to recruit such personnel if we fail to hire and retain qualified employees we may not be able to maintain and expand our business

 

there is uncertainty as to our shareholders’ ability to enforce certain foreign civil liabilities in switzerland and taiwan 

  

we are a swiss company and a substantial portion of our assets are located outside the united states particularly in taiwan as a result it may be difficult to effect service of process within the united states upon us in addition there is uncertainty as to whether the courts of switzerland or taiwan would recognize or enforce judgments of united states courts obtained against us predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the united states or any state thereof or be competent to hear original actions brought in switzerland or taiwan against us predicated upon the securities laws of the united states or any state thereof

 

a shut down of us airspace or imposition of restrictions on general aviation would harm our business 

  

following the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks the faa ordered all aircraft operating in the us to be grounded for several days in addition to this shut down of us airspace the general aviation industry was further impacted by the additional restrictions implemented by the faa on those flights that fly utilizing visual flight rules vfr the faa restricted vfr flight inside 30 enhanced class b a 2025 mile radius around the 30 largest metropolitan areas in the usa airspace areas the aircraft owners and pilots association aopa estimated that these restrictions affected approximately 41800 general aviation aircraft based at 282 airports inside the 30 enhanced class b airspace areas the aopa estimates that approximately 90 of all general aviation flights are conducted vfr and that only 15 of general aviation pilots are current to fly utilizing instrument flight rules ifr

 

the shutdown of us airspace following september 11 2001 caused reduced sales of our general aviation products and delays in the shipment of our products manufactured in our taiwan manufacturing facility to our distribution facility in olathe kansas thereby adversely affecting our ability to supply new and existing products to our dealers and distributors

 

any future shut down of us airspace or imposition of restrictions on general aviation could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results

 





 

many of our products rely on the global positioning system 

  

the global positioning system gps is a satellitebased navigation and positioning system consisting of a constellation of orbiting satellites the satellites and their ground control and monitoring stations are maintained and operated by the united states department of defense the department of defense does not currently charge users for access to the satellite signals these satellites and their ground support systems are complex electronic systems subject to electronic and mechanical failures and possible sabotage the satellites were originally designed to have lives of 75 years and are subject to damage by the hostile space environment in which they operate however of the current deployment of satellites in place some have been operating for more than 12 years

 

to repair damaged or malfunctioning satellites is currently not economically feasible if a significant number of satellites were to become inoperable there could be a substantial delay before they are replaced with new satellites a reduction in the number of operating satellites may impair the current utility of the gps system and the growth of current and additional market opportunities gps satellites and ground control segments are being modernized gps modernization software updates can cause problems we depend on public access to open technical specifications in advance of gps updates

 

gps is operated by the u s government which is committed to maintenance and improvement of gps however if the policy were to change and gps were no longer supported by the u s government or if user fees were imposed it could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition

 

some of our products also use signals from satellite based augmentation systems sbas that augment gps such as the us wide area augmentation system waas japanese mtsatbased satellite augmentation system msas european geostationary navigation overlay service egnos any curtailment of sbas operating capability could result in decreased user capability for many of our aviation products thereby impacting our markets

 

any of the foregoing factors could affect the willingness of buyers of our products to select global positioning systembased products instead of products based on competing technologies

 

any reallocation or repurposing of radio frequency spectrum could cause harmful interference with the reception of global positioning system signals this interference could harm our business 

  

our global positioning system technology is dependent on the use of the standard positioning service sps provided by the us government’s global positioning system satellites the global positioning system operates in radio frequency bands that are globally allocated for radio navigation satellite services international allocations of radio frequency are made by the international telecommunications union itu a specialized technical agency of the united nations these allocations are further governed by radio regulations that have treaty status and which may be subject to modification every two to three years by the world radio communication conference each country also has regulatory authority on how each band is used in the united states the federal communications commission fcc and the national telecommunications and information administration share responsibility for radio frequency allocations and spectrum usage regulations

 

any itu or national reallocation of radio frequency spectrum including frequency band segmentation or sharing of spectrum or other modifications of the permitted uses of relevant frequency bands may materially and adversely affect the utility and reliability of our products and have significant negative impacts on our business and our customers

 

our business is subject to disruptions and uncertainties caused by war or terrorism 

 

acts of war or acts of terrorism especially any directed at the gps signals could have a material adverse impact on our business operating results and financial condition the threat of terrorism and war and heightened security and military response to this threat or any future acts of terrorism may cause a redeployment of the satellites used in gps or interruptions of the system to the extent that such interruptions have an effect on sales of our products this could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition

 





 

 

 

privacy concerns relating to our technology could damage our reputation and deter current and potential users from using our products and applications 

  

concerns about our practices with regard to the collection use disclosure or security of personal information user location information or other privacy related matters even if unfounded could damage our reputation and operating results while we strive to comply with all applicable data protection laws and regulations as well as our own posted privacy policies any failure or perceived failure to comply may result in proceedings or actions against us by government entities or others or could cause us to lose users and customers which could potentially have an adverse effect on our business

 

regulatory authorities around the world are considering a number of legislative and regulatory proposals concerning data protection in addition the interpretation and application of consumer and data protection laws in the us europe and elsewhere are often uncertain and in flux it is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our data practices if so in addition to the possibility of fines this could result in an order requiring that we change our data practices which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations complying with these various laws could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business

 

security breaches and other disruptions including as a result of cyber attacks could compromise our information and expose us to liability which would cause our business and reputation to suffer 

  

in the ordinary course of our business we collect and store sensitive data including intellectual property our proprietary business information and that of our customers and suppliers and some personally identifiable information of our customers and employees in our facilities and on our networks the secure processing maintenance and transmission of this information is important to our operations despite our security measures our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error or other disruptions any such breach could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed publicly disclosed lost or stolen any such access disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings disrupt our operations damage our reputation and cause a loss of confidence which could adversely affect our business

 

we may be exposed to certain regulatory and financial risks related to climate change 

 

climate change is receiving increasing attention worldwide some scientists legislators and others attribute global warming to increased levels of greenhouse gases including carbon dioxide which has led to significant legislative and regulatory efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions

 

various regulatory and legislative measures to address greenhouse gas emissions are in different phases of implementation or discussion in the aftermath of its 2009 “endangerment finding” that greenhouse gas emissions pose a threat to human health and welfare the environmental protection agency has begun to regulate greenhouse gas emissions under the authority granted to it under the clean air act at the federal legislative level congressional passage of legislation adopting some form of federal mandatory greenhouse gas emission reduction such as a nationwide capandtrade program does not appear likely at this time although it could be adopted at a future date it is also possible that congress may pass alternative climate change bills that do not mandate a nationwide capandtrade program and instead focus on promoting renewable energy and energy efficiency which could increase the cost of doing business 

 

because it is uncertain what laws and regulations will be enacted we cannot predict the potential impact of such laws and regulations on our future consolidated financial condition results of operations or cash flows

 





 

risks relating to our shares 

 

the volatility of our stock price could adversely affect investment in our common shares 

 

the market price of our common shares has been and may continue to be highly volatile during 2012 the price of our common shares ranged from a low of 3584 to a high of 4933 a variety of factors could cause the price of our common shares to fluctuate perhaps substantially including

 

            

in addition in recent years the stock market in general and the markets for shares of technology companies in particular have experienced extreme price fluctuations which have often been unrelated to the operating performance of affected companies any such fluctuations in the future could adversely affect the market price of our common shares

 

our officers and directors exert substantial influence over us 

  

as of january 9 2013 current members and former members of our board of directors and our executive officers together with members of their families and entities that may be deemed affiliates of or related to such persons or entities beneficially owned approximately 4048 of our outstanding common shares accordingly these shareholders may be able to determine the outcome of corporate actions requiring shareholder approval such as mergers and acquisitions this level of ownership may have a significant effect in delaying deferring or preventing a change in control of garmin and may adversely affect the voting and other rights of other holders of our common shares

 

the rights of our shareholders are governed by swiss law 

  

the rights of our shareholders are governed by swiss law and garmin ltd’s articles of association and organizational regulations the rights of shareholders under swiss law differ from the rights of shareholders of companies incorporated in other jurisdictions for example swiss law allows our shareholders acting at a shareholders’ meeting to authorize share capital that can be issued by the board of directors without approval of a shareholders’ meeting but this authorization is limited to 50 of the existing registered share capital and must be renewed at a shareholders’ meeting at least every two years for it to continue to be available additionally subject to specified exceptions including the exceptions described in our articles of association swiss law grants preemptive rights to existing shareholders to subscribe for new issuances of shares and other securities swiss law also does not provide as much flexibility in the various terms that can attach to different classes of shares as the laws of some other jurisdictions swiss law also reserves for approval by shareholders certain corporate actions over which a board of directors would have authority in some other jurisdictions for example swiss law provides that dividends and other distributions must be approved by shareholders at the general meeting of shareholders these swiss law requirements relating to our capital management may limit our flexibility and situations may arise where greater flexibility would have provided substantial benefits to our shareholders

 





 

we may not be able to make distributions or repurchase shares without subjecting you to swiss withholding tax 

  

if we are unable to make distributions if any through a reduction of par value or to pay dividends if any out of qualifying capital contribution reserves then any dividends paid by us will generally be subject to a swiss federal withholding tax at a rate of 35 the withholding tax must be withheld from the gross distribution and paid to the swiss federal tax administration a us holder that qualifies for benefits under the convention between the united states of america and the swiss confederation for the avoidance of double taxation with respect to taxes on income may apply for a refund of the tax withheld in excess of the 15 treaty rate or in excess of the 5 reduced treaty rate for qualifying corporate shareholders with at least 10 participation in our voting stock or for a full refund in case of qualified pension funds payment of a capital distribution in the form of a par value reduction or a dividend out of qualifying capital contribution reserves is not subject to swiss withholding tax however there can be no assurance that our shareholders will approve a reduction in par value or a dividend out of qualifying capital contribution reserves that we will be able to meet the other legal requirements for a reduction in par value or that swiss withholding rules will not be changed in the future or that a change in swiss law will not adversely affect us or our shareholders in particular as a result of distributions out of qualifying capital contribution reserves becoming subject to additional corporate law or other restrictions there are currently legislative projects pending in swiss parliament and the swiss federal administration that – depending on their final form – may limit the distribution of qualifying capital contribution reserves in addition over the long term the amount of par value and qualifying capital contribution reserves available for us to use for par value reductions or dividends will be limited if we are unable to make a distribution through a reduction in par value or to pay a dividend out of qualifying capital contribution reserves we may not be able to make distributions without subjecting you to swiss withholding taxes 

 

under current swiss tax law repurchases of shares for the purposes of capital reduction are treated as a partial liquidation subject to 35 swiss withholding tax on the difference between the par value and the repurchase price however the portion of the repurchase price that is attributed to qualifying capital contribution reserves of the shares repurchased will not be subject to the swiss withholding tax no partial liquidation treatment applies and no withholding tax is triggered if the shares are not repurchased for cancellation but held by us as treasury shares however should we not resell such treasury shares within six years the withholding tax becomes due at the end of the six year period 

 

we may follow a share repurchase process for future share repurchases if any similar to a second trading line on the six swiss exchange in which swiss institutional investors buy shares on the open market and sell these shares to us and are generally able to receive a refund of the swiss withholding tax however if we are unable to use this process successfully we may not be able to repurchase shares for the purposes of capital reduction without subjecting you to swiss withholding taxes if and to the extent that the repurchase of shares is made out of retained earnings or other taxable reserves no withholding tax would be applicable if and to the extent that qualifying capital contribution reserves are attributable to the share repurchase

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

market sensitivity 

  

we have market risk primarily in connection with the pricing of our products and services and the purchase of raw materials product pricing and raw materials costs are both significantly influenced by semiconductor market conditions historically during cyclical industry downturns we have been able to offset pricing declines for our products through a combination of improved product mix and success in obtaining price reductions in raw materials costs

 

inflation 

  

we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our business financial condition or results of operations if our costs were to become subject to significant inflationary pressures we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs through price increases our inability or failure to do so could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations

 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

 

the operation of garmin’s subsidiaries in international markets results in exposure to movements in currency exchange rates we have experienced significant foreign currency gains and losses due to the strengthening and weakening of the us dollar the potential of volatile foreign exchange rate fluctuations in the future could have a significant effect on our results of operations

 

the currencies that create a majority of the company’s exchange rate exposure are the taiwan dollar euro and british pound sterling garmin corporation headquartered in sijhih taiwan uses the local currency as the functional currency the company translates all assets and liabilities at yearend exchange rates and income and expense accounts at average rates during the year in order to minimize the effect of the currency exchange fluctuations on our net assets we have elected to retain most of our taiwan subsidiary’s cash and investments in marketable securities denominated in us dollars

 

most european subsidiaries use the euro as the functional currency  the functional currency of our largest european subsidiary garmin europe ltd remains the us dollar and as some transactions occurred in british pounds sterling or euros foreign currency gains or losses have been realized historically related to the movements of those currencies relative to the us dollar the company believes that gains and losses will become more material in the future as our european presence grows in 2012 the us dollar weakened 21 and 43 respectively relative to the euro and british pound sterling resulting in a foreign currency gain of 104 million in garmin ltd and our european subsidiaries the us dollar weakened 38 against the taiwan dollar resulting in a 313 million foreign currency loss due to the fluctuation of asset balances throughout the year the net result of these currency moves combined with other gains of 08 million and the timing of transactions during the year was a net loss of 200 million for the company and a cumulative translation adjustment of 1290 million at the end of fiscal 2012 

 

interest rate risk 

 

we have no outstanding longterm debt as of december 29 2012 we therefore have no meaningful debtrelated interest rate risk

 

we are exposed to interest rate risk in connection with our investments in marketable securities as interest rates change the unrealized gains and losses associated with those securities will fluctuate accordingly a hypothetical change of 10 in interest rates would not have a material effect on such unrealized gains or losses at december 29 2012 pretax cumulative net unrealized gains on those securities were 104 million

a company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements

 

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate

 

in our opinion garmin ltd maintained in all material respects effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 29 2012 based on the coso criteria

 

we have also audited in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states the consolidated balance sheets of garmin ltd and subsidiaries as of december 29 2012 and december 31 2011 and the related consolidated statements of income comprehensive income stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended december 29 2012 of garmin ltd and subsidiaries and our report dated february 27 2013 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon

part iv 

  







 item 1a risk factors 

  

the risks described below are not the only ones facing our company additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also impair our business operations if any of the following risks occur our business financial condition or operating results could be materially adversely affected 

  

risks related to the company 

  

the demand for personal navigation devices pnds may be eroded by replacement technologies becoming available on mobile handsets and factoryinstalled systems in new autos 

  

we have historically experienced substantial growth in the automotivemobile segment which has resulted in gpsnavigation technologies being incorporated into competing devices such as mobile handsets and new automobiles through factoryinstalled systems mobile handsets are frequently gpsenabled and many companies are now offering navigation software for mobile devices the acceptance of this technology by consumers has halted our growth and could further reduce margins navigation systems are also becoming more prevalent as optional equipment on new automobiles increased navigation penetration on new automobiles could cause further declines in sales of our portable navigation devices and further reduce margins

 

our financial results are highly dependent on the automotivemobile segment which represents approximately 58 of our revenues and is maturing 

  

we have historically experienced substantial growth in the automotivemobile segment of our business as the products have become massmarket consumer electronics in both europe and north america this market has peaked as penetration rates increase and competing technologies emerge this has resulted in lower revenues and lower earnings per share

  





  

economic conditions and uncertainty could adversely affect our revenue and margins 

  

our revenue and margins depend significantly on general economic conditions and the demand for products in the markets in which we compete the current economic weakness and constrained consumer and business spending has resulted in decreased revenue and in the future could result in decreased revenue and problems with our ability to manage inventory levels and collect customer receivables in addition financial difficulties experienced by our retailer and oem customers have resulted and could result in the future in significant bad debt writeoffs and additions to reserves in our receivables and could have an adverse affect on our results of operations

  

gross margins for our products may fluctuate or erode 

  

gross margins on our automotivemobile products have been declining and are expected to decline in 2012 due to price reductions in the increasingly competitive market for personal navigation devices pnds that are not fully offset by material cost reductions in addition our overall gross margin may fluctuate from period to period due to a number of factors including product mix competition and unit volumes in particular the average selling prices of a specific product tend to decrease over that product’s life to offset such decreases we intend to rely primarily on component cost reduction obtaining yield improvements and corresponding cost reductions in the manufacture of existing products and on introducing new products that incorporate advanced features and therefore can be sold at higher average selling prices however there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain any such yield improvements or cost reductions or introduce any such new products in the future to the extent that such cost reductions and new product introductions do not occur in a timely manner or our products do not achieve market acceptance our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected

  

changes in our united states federal income tax classification or in applicable tax law could result in adverse tax consequences to our shareholders 

 

we do not believe that we or any of our nonunited states subsidiaries are currently a ‘‘passive foreign investment company’’ for united states federal income tax purposes we do not expect to become a passive foreign investment company however because the passive foreign investment company determination is made annually based on whether the company’s income or assets meet certain thresholds as determined under united states federal tax principles which are based on facts and circumstances that may be beyond our control we cannot assure that we will not become a passive foreign investment company in the future if we are a passive foreign investment company in any year then any of our shareholders that is a united states person could be liable to pay tax on their pro rata share of our income plus an interest charge upon some distributions by us or when that shareholder sells our common shares at a gain further if we are classified as a passive foreign investment company in any year in which a united states person is a shareholder we generally will continue to be treated as a passive foreign investment company with respect to such shareholder in all succeeding years regardless of whether we continue to satisfy the income or asset tests mentioned above

 

we do not believe that we or any of our nonunited states subsidiaries are currently a controlled foreign corporation cfc for united states federal income tax purposes we do not expect to become a cfc the cfc determination is made daily based on whether the united states shareholders own more than fifty percent of the voting power or value of the company only united states persons that own ten percent or more of the voting power of the company’s shares qualify as united states shareholders if the company were to be classified as a cfc for an uninterrupted thirty day period in any year the company’s shareholders that qualify as united states shareholders could be liable to pay us income tax at ordinary income tax rates on their prorata share of certain categories of the company’s income for the period in which the company is classified as a cfc as the company cannot control the ownership of the company’s stock nor can the company control which shareholders participate in the company’s stock buyback program ownership changes could result that create united states shareholders which increase the risk of garmin being treated as a cfc

 





 

legislative proposals have been considered in the united states within the past few years that could increase the united states tax burden of corporations with international operations and could broaden the circumstances under which foreign corporations could be considered resident in the united states our tax position could be adversely impacted by changes in united states or foreign tax laws tax treaties or tax regulations or the interpretation or enforcement thereof by any tax authority we cannot predict the outcome of any specific legislative proposals

 

if we are not successful in the continued development introduction or timely manufacture of new products demand for our products could decrease 

  

we expect that a significant portion of our future revenue will continue to be derived from sales of newly introduced products the market for our products is characterized by rapidly changing technology evolving industry standards and changes in customer needs if we fail to introduce new products or to modify or improve our existing products in response to changes in technology industry standards or customer needs our products could rapidly become less competitive or obsolete we must continue to make significant investments in research and development in order to continue to develop new products enhance existing products and achieve market acceptance for such products however there can be no assurance that development stage products will be successfully completed or if developed will achieve significant customer acceptance

 

if we are unable to successfully develop and introduce competitive new products and enhance our existing products our future results of operations would be adversely affected our pursuit of necessary technology may require substantial time and expense we may need to license new technologies to respond to technological change these licenses may not be available to us on terms that we can accept or may materially change the gross profits that we are able to obtain on our products we may not succeed in adapting our products to new technologies as they emerge development and manufacturing schedules for technology products are difficult to predict and there can be no assurance that we will achieve timely initial customer shipments of new products the timely availability of these products in volume and their acceptance by customers are important to our future success from time to time we have experienced delays in shipping certain of our new products and any future delays whether due to product development delays manufacturing delays lack of market acceptance delays in regulatory approval or otherwise could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations

  

if we are unable to compete effectively with existing or new competitors our resulting loss of competitive position could result in price reductions fewer customer orders reduced margins and loss of market share 

  

the markets for our products are highly competitive and we expect competition to increase in the future some of our competitors have significantly greater financial technical and marketing resources than we do these competitors may be able to respond more rapidly to new or emerging technologies or changes in customer requirements they may also be able to devote greater resources to the development promotion and sale of their products increased competition could result in price reductions fewer customer orders reduced margins and loss of market share our failure to compete successfully against current or future competitors could seriously harm our business financial condition and results of operations

  





  

we rely on independent dealers and distributors to sell our products and disruption to these channels would harm our business 

  

because we sell a majority of our products to independent dealers and distributors we are subject to many risks including risks related to their inventory levels and support for our products in particular our dealers and distributors maintain significant levels of our products in their inventories if dealers and distributors attempt to reduce their levels of inventory or if they do not maintain sufficient levels to meet customer demand our sales could be negatively impacted

 

many of our dealers and distributors also sell products offered by our competitors if our competitors offer our dealers and distributors more favorable terms those dealers and distributors may deemphasize or decline to carry our products in the future we may not be able to retain or attract a sufficient number of qualified dealers and distributors if we are unable to maintain successful relationships with dealers and distributors or to expand our distribution channels our business will suffer

  

our quarterly operating results are subject to fluctuations and seasonality 

  

our operating results are difficult to predict our future quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly if such operating results decline the price of our stock would likely decline as we expand our operations our operating expenses particularly our advertising and research and development costs may increase as a percentage of our sales if revenues decrease and we are unable to reduce those costs rapidly our operating results would be negatively affected

 

historically our revenues have been weaker in the first quarter of each fiscal year and have recently been lower than the preceding fourth quarter our devices are highly consumeroriented and consumer buying is traditionally lower in these quarters sales of certain of our marine and automotive products tend to be higher in our second fiscal quarter due to increased consumer spending for such products during the recreational marine fishing and travel season sales of our automotivemobile products also have been higher in our fourth fiscal quarter due to increased consumer spending patterns on electronic devices during the holiday season in addition we attempt to time our new product releases to coincide with relatively higher consumer spending in the second and fourth fiscal quarters which contributes to these seasonal variations

  

our quarterly financial statements will reflect fluctuations in foreign currency translation 

 

the operation of garmin’s subsidiaries in international markets results in exposure to movements in currency exchange rates we have experienced significant foreign currency gains and losses due to the strengthening and weakening of the us dollar the potential of volatile foreign exchange rate fluctuations in the future could have a significant effect on our results of operations

 

the currencies that create a majority of the company’s exchange rate exposure are the taiwan dollar euro and british pound sterling garmin corporation headquartered in sijhih taiwan uses the local currency as the functional currency the company translates all assets and liabilities at yearend exchange rates and income and expense accounts at average rates during the year in order to minimize the effect of the currency exchange fluctuations on our net assets we have elected to retain most of our taiwan subsidiary’s cash and investments in marketable securities denominated in us dollars

 

nonetheless us gaap requires the company at the end of each accounting period to translate into taiwan dollars all such us dollar denominated assets held by our taiwan subsidiary this translation is required because the taiwan dollar is the functional currency of the subsidiary this us gaapmandated translation will cause us to recognize gain or loss on our financial statements as the taiwan dollarus dollar exchange rate varies such gain or loss will create variations in our earnings per share because there is minimal cash impact caused by such exchange rate variations management will continue to focus on the company’s operating performance before the impact of the foreign currency translation

 





 

if we do not correctly anticipate demand for our products we may not be able to secure sufficient quantities or costeffective production of our products or we could have costly excess production or inventories 

  

we have generally been able to increase production to meet this increasing demand however the demand for our products depends on many factors and will be difficult to forecast we expect that it will become more difficult to forecast demand as we introduce and support multiple products as competition in the market for our products intensifies and as the markets for some of our products mature to the mass market category significant unanticipated fluctuations in demand could cause the following problems in our operations

 

  

  

 

 

we have benefited in the past from taiwan government tax incentives offered on certain high technology capital investments that may not always be available 

  

our effective tax rate is lower than the us federal statutory rate in part because we have benefited from incentives offered in taiwan related to our high technology investments in taiwan the loss of these tax benefits could have a significant effect on our financial results in the future

 

we may experience unique economic and political risks associated with companies that operate in taiwan 

  

relations between taiwan and the people’s republic of china also referred to as the prc and other factors affecting the political or economic conditions of taiwan in the future could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations and the market price and the liquidity of our shares our principal manufacturing facilities where we manufacture all of our products except our panelmounted aviation products are located in taiwan

 

taiwan has a unique international political status the prc asserts sovereignty over all of china including taiwan certain other islands and all of mainland china the prc government does not recognize the legitimacy of the taiwan government although significant economic and cultural relations have been established during recent years between taiwan and the prc the prc government has indicated that it may use military force to gain control over taiwan in certain circumstances such as the declaration of independence by taiwan relations between taiwan and the prc have on occasion adversely affected the market value of taiwanese companies and could negatively affect our operations in taiwan in the future

 

our intellectual property rights are important to our operations and we could suffer loss if they infringe upon other’s rights or are infringed upon by others 

  

we rely on a combination of patents copyrights trademarks and trade secrets confidentiality provisions and licensing arrangements to establish and protect our proprietary rights to this end we hold rights to a number of patents and registered trademarks and regularly file applications to attempt to protect our rights in new technology and trademarks however there is no guarantee that our patent applications will become issued patents or that our trademark applications will become registered trademarks moreover even if approved our patents or trademarks may thereafter be successfully challenged by others or otherwise become invalidated for a variety of reasons thus any patents or trademarks we currently have or may later acquire may not provide us a significant competitive advantage

 





 

third parties may claim that we are infringing their intellectual property rights such claims could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition from time to time we receive letters alleging infringement of patents trademarks or other intellectual property rights litigation concerning patents or other intellectual property is costly and time consuming we may seek licenses from such parties but they could refuse to grant us a license or demand commercially unreasonable terms we might not have sufficient resources to pay for the licenses such infringement claims could also cause us to incur substantial liabilities and to suspend or permanently cease the use of critical technologies or processes or the production or sale of major products

 

we may become subject to significant product liability costs 

  

if our aviation products malfunction or contain errors or defects airplane collisions or crashes could occur resulting in property damage personal injury or death malfunctions or errors or defects in our marine navigational products could cause boats to run aground or cause other wreckage personal injury or death if our automotive or marine products contain defects or errors in the mapping supplied by thirdparty map providers or if our users do not heed our warnings about the proper use of these products collisions or accidents could occur resulting in property damage personal injury or death if any of these events occurs we could be subject to significant liability for personal injury and property damage and under certain circumstances could be subject to a judgment for punitive damages we maintain insurance against accidentrelated risks involving our products however there can be no assurance that such insurance would be sufficient to cover the cost of damages to others or that such insurance will continue to be available at commercially reasonable rates in addition insurance coverage generally will not cover awards of punitive damages and may not cover the cost of associated legal fees and defense costs which could result in lower margins if we are unable to maintain sufficient insurance to cover product liability costs or if our insurance coverage does not cover the award this could have a materially adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations

 

we depend on our suppliers some of which are the sole source for specific components and our production would be seriously harmed if these suppliers are not able to meet our demand and alternative sources are not available or if the costs of components rise 

  

we are dependent on third party suppliers for various components used in our current products some of the components that we procure from third party suppliers include semiconductors and electroluminescent panels liquid crystal displays memory chips batteries and microprocessors the cost quality and availability of components are essential to the successful production and sale of our products some components we use are from sole source suppliers certain applicationspecific integrated circuits incorporating our proprietary designs are manufactured for us by sole source suppliers alternative sources may not be currently available for these sole source components

 

in the past we have experienced shortages of liquid crystal displays and other components in addition if there are shortages in supply of components the costs of such components may rise if suppliers are unable to meet our demand for components on a timely basis and if we are unable to obtain an alternative source or if the price of the alternative source is prohibitive or if the costs of components rise our ability to maintain timely and costeffective production of our products would be seriously harmed

  

we depend on third party licensors for the digital map data contained in our automotivemobile products and our business andor gross margins could be harmed if we become unable to continue licensing such mapping data or if the royalty costs for such data rise 

  

we license digital mapping data for use in our products from various sources there are only a limited number of suppliers of mapping data for each geographical region the two largest digital map suppliers are navteq corporation and tele atlas nv navteq corporation is owned by nokia oyj and tele atlas nv is owned by tomtom nv nokia and tomtom are both competitors of garmin

 





 

although we do not foresee difficulty in continuing to license data at favorable pricing due to the long term license extension signed between garmin and navteq in november 2007 extending our navteq license agreement through 2017 with an option to extend through 2021 if we are unable to continue licensing such mapping data and are unable to obtain an alternative source or if the nature of our relationships with navteq changes detrimentally our ability to supply mapping data for use in our products would be seriously harmed

  

we may pursue strategic acquisitions investments strategic partnerships or other ventures and our business could be materially harmed if we fail to successfully identify complete and integrate such transactions 

  

we intend to evaluate acquisition opportunities and opportunities to make investments in complementary businesses technologies services or products or to enter into strategic partnerships with parties who can provide access to those assets additional product or services offerings additional distribution or marketing synergies or additional industry expertise we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition investment or strategic partnership candidates or if we do identify suitable candidates in the future we may not be able to complete those transactions on commercially favorable terms or at all

 

any past or future acquisitions could also result in difficulties assimilating acquired employees including cultural differences with foreign acquisitions operations and products and diversion of capital and management’s attention away from other business issues and opportunities integration of acquired companies may result in problems related to integration of technology and inexperienced management teams in addition the key personnel of the acquired company may decide not to work for us we may not successfully integrate internal controls compliance under the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 and other corporate governance matters operations personnel or products related to acquisitions we have made in previous years or may make in the future if we fail to successfully integrate such transactions our business could be materially harmed

 

we may have additional tax liabilities 

  

we are subject to income taxes in switzerland the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes in the ordinary course of our business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain we are regularly under audit by tax authorities although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals the results of an audit or litigation could have a material effect on our income tax provision net income or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made

 

failure to obtain required certifications of our products on a timely basis could harm our business 

  

we have certain products especially in our aviation segment that are subject to governmental and similar certifications before they can be sold for example faa certification is required for all of our aviation products that are intended for installation in type certificated aircraft to the extent required certification is an expensive and timeconsuming process that requires significant focus and resources an inability to obtain or excessive delay in obtaining such certifications could have an adverse effect on our ability to introduce new products and for certain aviation oem products our customers’ ability to sell airplanes therefore such inabilities or delays could adversely affect our operating results in addition we cannot assure you that our certified products will not be decertified any such decertification could have an adverse effect on our operating results

 

our business may suffer if we are not able to hire and retain sufficient qualified personnel or if we lose our key personnel 

  

our future success depends partly on the continued contribution of our key executive engineering sales marketing manufacturing and administrative personnel we currently do not have employment agreements with any of our key executive officers we do not have key man life insurance on any of our key executive officers and do not currently intend to obtain such insurance the loss of the services of any of our senior level management or other key employees could harm our business recruiting and retaining the skilled personnel we require to maintain and grow our market position may be difficult for example in some recent years there has been a nationwide shortage of qualified electrical engineers and software engineers who are necessary for us to design and develop new products and therefore it has sometimes been challenging to recruit such personnel if we fail to hire and retain qualified employees we may not be able to maintain and expand our business

 





 

there is uncertainty as to our shareholders’ ability to enforce certain foreign civil liabilities in switzerland and taiwan 

  

we are a swiss company and a substantial portion of our assets are located outside the united states particularly in taiwan as a result it may be difficult to effect service of process within the united states upon us in addition there is uncertainty as to whether the courts of switzerland or taiwan would recognize or enforce judgments of united states courts obtained against us predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the united states or any state thereof or be competent to hear original actions brought in switzerland or taiwan against us predicated upon the securities laws of the united states or any state thereof

 

a shut down of us airspace or imposition of restrictions on general aviation would harm our business 

  

following the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks the faa ordered all aircraft operating in the us to be grounded for several days in addition to this shut down of us airspace the general aviation industry was further impacted by the additional restrictions implemented by the faa on those flights that fly utilizing visual flight rules vfr the faa restricted vfr flight inside 30 enhanced class b a 2025 mile radius around the 30 largest metropolitan areas in the usa airspace areas the aircraft owners and pilots association aopa estimated that these restrictions affected approximately 41800 general aviation aircraft based at 282 airports inside the 30 enhanced class b airspace areas the aopa estimates that approximately 90 of all general aviation flights are conducted vfr and that only 15 of general aviation pilots are current to fly utilizing instrument flight rules ifr

 

the shutdown of us airspace following september 11 2001 caused reduced sales of our general aviation products and delays in the shipment of our products manufactured in our taiwan manufacturing facility to our distribution facility in olathe kansas thereby adversely affecting our ability to supply new and existing products to our dealers and distributors

 

any future shut down of us airspace or imposition of restrictions on general aviation could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results

 

many of our products rely on the global positioning system 

  

the global positioning system gps is a satellitebased navigation and positioning system consisting of a constellation of orbiting satellites the satellites and their ground control and monitoring stations are maintained and operated by the united states department of defense the department of defense does not currently charge users for access to the satellite signals these satellites and their ground support systems are complex electronic systems subject to electronic and mechanical failures and possible sabotage the satellites were originally designed to have lives of 75 years and are subject to damage by the hostile space environment in which they operate however of the current deployment of satellites in place some have been operating for more than 12 years

 

to repair damaged or malfunctioning satellites is currently not economically feasible if a significant number of satellites were to become inoperable there could be a substantial delay before they are replaced with new satellites a reduction in the number of operating satellites may impair the current utility of the gps system and the growth of current and additional market opportunities gps satellites and ground control segments are being modernized gps modernization software updates can cause problems we depend on public access to open technical specifications in advance of gps updates

 





 

gps is operated by the u s government which is committed to maintenance and improvement of gps however if the policy were to change and gps were no longer supported by the u s government or if user fees were imposed it could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition

 

some of our products also use signals from satellite based augmentation systems sbas that augment gps such as the us wide area augmentation system waas japanese mtsatbased satellite augmentation system msas european geostationary navigation overlay service egnos any curtailment of sbas operating capability could result in decreased user capability for many of our aviation products thereby impacting our markets

 

any of the foregoing factors could affect the willingness of buyers of our products to select global positioning systembased products instead of products based on competing technologies

 

any reallocation or repurposing of radio frequency spectrum could cause harmful interference with the reception of global positioning system signals this interference could harm our business 

  

our global positioning system technology is dependent on the use of the standard positioning service sps provided by the us government’s global positioning system satellites the global positioning system operates in radio frequency bands that are globally allocated for radio navigation satellite services international allocations of radio frequency are made by the international telecommunications union itu a specialized technical agency of the united nations these allocations are further governed by radio regulations that have treaty status and which may be subject to modification every two to three years by the world radio communication conference each country also has regulatory authority on how each band is used in the united states the federal communications commission fcc and the national telecommunications and information administration share responsibility for radio frequency allocations and spectrum usage regulations

 

any itu or national reallocation of radio frequency spectrum including frequency band segmentation or sharing of spectrum or other modifications of the permitted uses of relevant frequency bands may materially and adversely affect the utility and reliability of our products and have significant negative impacts on our business and our customers for example the fcc is currently considering a proposal by a private party lightsquared to repurpose spectrum adjacent to the gps bands for terrestrial broadband wireless operations in metropolitan areas throughout the united states if the fcc were to permit implementation of lightsquared’s proposal as is terrestrial broadband wireless operations would create harmful interference to gps receivers within range of such operations   

 

our business is subject to disruptions and uncertainties caused by war or terrorism 

 

acts of war or acts of terrorism especially any directed at the gps signals could have a material adverse impact on our business operating results and financial condition the threat of terrorism and war and heightened security and military response to this threat or any future acts of terrorism may cause a redeployment of the satellites used in gps or interruptions of the system to the extent that such interruptions have an effect on sales of our products this could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition

  

privacy concerns relating to our technology could damage our reputation and deter current and potential users from using our products and applications 

 

concerns about our practices with regard to the collection use disclosure or security of personal information user location information or other privacy related matters even if unfounded could damage our reputation and operating results while we strive to comply with all applicable data protection laws and regulations as well as our own posted privacy policies any failure or perceived failure to comply may result in proceedings or actions against us by government entities or others or could cause us to lose users and customers which could potentially have an adverse effect on our business

 





 

regulatory authorities around the world are considering a number of legislative and regulatory proposals concerning data protection in addition the interpretation and application of consumer and data protection laws in the us europe and elsewhere are often uncertain and in flux it is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our data practices if so in addition to the possibility of fines this could result in an order requiring that we change our data practices which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations complying with these various laws could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business

 

security breaches and other disruptions could compromise our information and expose us to liability which would cause our business and reputation to suffer 

 

in the ordinary course of our business we collect and store sensitive data including intellectual property our proprietary business information and that of our customers and suppliers and some personally identifiable information of our customers and employees in our facilities and on our networks the secure processing maintenance and transmission of this information is important to our operations despite our security measures our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error or other disruptions any such breach could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed publicly disclosed lost or stolen any such access disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings disrupt our operations damage our reputation and cause a loss of confidence which could adversely affect our business

 

we may be exposed to certain regulatory and financial risks related to climate change 

 

climate change is receiving increasing attention worldwide some scientists legislators and others attribute global warming to increased levels of greenhouse gases including carbon dioxide which has led to significant legislative and regulatory efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions

 

various regulatory and legislative measures to address greenhouse gas emissions are in different phases of implementation or discussion in the aftermath of its 2009 “endangerment finding” that greenhouse gas emissions pose a threat to human health and welfare the epa has begun to regulate greenhouse gas emissions under the authority granted to it under the clean air act at the federal legislative level congressional passage of legislation adopting some form of federal mandatory greenhouse gas emission reduction such as a nationwide capandtrade program does not appear likely at this time although it could be adopted at a future date it is also possible that congress may pass alternative climate change bills that do not mandate a nationwide capandtrade program and instead focus on promoting renewable energy and energy efficiency which could increase the cost of doing business 

 

because it is uncertain what laws and regulations will be enacted we cannot predict the potential impact of such laws and regulations on our future consolidated financial condition results of operations or cash flows

  

risks relating to our shares 

 

the volatility of our stock price could adversely affect investment in our common shares 

 

the market price of our common shares has been and may continue to be highly volatile during 2011 the price of our common shares ranged from a low of 3014 to a high of 4039 a variety of factors could cause the price of our common shares to fluctuate perhaps substantially including

 

   





 

          

in addition in recent years the stock market in general and the markets for shares of technology companies in particular have experienced extreme price fluctuations which have often been unrelated to the operating performance of affected companies any such fluctuations in the future could adversely affect the market price of our common shares

  

our officers and directors exert substantial influence over us 

  

as of january 10 2012 current members and former members of our board of directors and our executive officers together with members of their families and entities that may be deemed affiliates of or related to such persons or entities beneficially owned approximately 4440 of our outstanding common shares accordingly these shareholders may be able to determine the outcome of corporate actions requiring shareholder approval such as mergers and acquisitions this level of ownership may have a significant effect in delaying deferring or preventing a change in control of garmin and may adversely affect the voting and other rights of other holders of our common shares

 

the rights of our shareholders are governed by swiss law 

 

the rights of our shareholders are governed by swiss law and garmin ltd’s articles of association and organizational regulations the rights of shareholders under swiss law differ from the rights of shareholders of companies incorporated in other jurisdictions for example swiss law allows our shareholders acting at a shareholders’ meeting to authorize share capital that can be issued by the board of directors without approval of a shareholders’ meeting but this authorization is limited to 50 of the existing registered share capital and must be renewed at a shareholders’ meeting at least every two years additionally subject to specified exceptions including the exceptions described in our articles of association swiss law grants preemptive rights to existing shareholders to subscribe for new issuances of shares and other securities swiss law also provides that dividends must be approved by shareholders at the general meeting of our shareholders

 

we may not be able to make distributions or repurchase shares without subjecting you to swiss withholding tax 

 

if we are unable to make distributions if any through a reduction of par value or to pay dividends if any out of qualifying capital contribution reserves then any dividends paid by us will generally be subject to a swiss federal withholding tax at a rate of 35 the withholding tax must be withheld from the gross distribution and paid to the swiss federal tax administration a us holder that qualifies for benefits under the convention between the united states of america and the swiss confederation for the avoidance of double taxation with respect to taxes on income may apply for a refund of the tax withheld in excess of the 15 treaty rate or in excess of the 5 reduced treaty rate for qualifying corporate shareholders with at least 10 participation in our voting stock or for a full refund in case of qualified pension funds payment of a capital distribution in the form of a par value reduction or a dividend out of qualifying capital contribution reserves is not subject to swiss withholding tax however there can be no assurance that our shareholders will approve a reduction in par value or a dividend out of qualifying capital contribution reserves that we will be able to meet the other legal requirements for a reduction in par value or that swiss withholding rules will not be changed in the future in addition over the long term the amount of par value and qualifying capital contribution reserves available for us to use for par value reductions or dividends will be limited if we are unable to make a distribution through a reduction in par value or to pay a dividend out of qualifying capital contribution reserves we may not be able to make distributions without subjecting you to swiss withholding taxes

 





 

under current swiss tax law repurchases of shares for the purposes of capital reduction are treated as a partial liquidation subject to 35 swiss withholding tax on the difference between the par value and the repurchase price however the portion of the repurchase price that is attributed to the qualifying capital contribution reserves of the shares repurchased will not be subject to the swiss withholding tax we may follow a share repurchase process for future share repurchases if any similar to a second trading line on the swiss stock exchange in which swiss institutional investors buy shares on the open market and sell these shares to us and are generally able to receive a refund of the swiss withholding tax however if we are unable to use this process successfully we may not be able to repurchase shares for the purposes of capital reduction without subjecting you to swiss withholding taxes

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

market sensitivity 

we have market risk primarily in connection with the pricing of our products and services and the purchase of raw materials product pricing and raw materials costs are both significantly influenced by semiconductor market conditions historically during cyclical industry downturns we have been able to offset pricing declines for our products through a combination of improved product mix and success in obtaining price reductions in raw materials costs

  

inflation 

 

we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our business financial condition or results of operations if our costs were to become subject to significant inflationary pressures we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs through price increases our inability or failure to do so could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations

 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

 

the operation of garmin’s subsidiaries in international markets results in exposure to movements in currency exchange rates we have experienced significant foreign currency gains and losses due to the strengthening and weakening of the us dollar the potential of volatile foreign exchange rate fluctuations in the future could have a significant effect on our results of operations

 

the currencies that create a majority of the company’s exchange rate exposure are the taiwan dollar euro and british pound sterling garmin corporation headquartered in sijhih taiwan uses the local currency as the functional currency the company translates all assets and liabilities at yearend exchange rates and income and expense accounts at average rates during the year in order to minimize the effect of the currency exchange fluctuations on our net assets we have elected to retain most of our taiwan subsidiary’s cash and investments in marketable securities denominated in us dollars

 





 

all european subsidiaries excluding garmin europe ltd garmin danmark garmin sweden garmin polska and garmin norge use the euro as the functional currency  the functional currency of our largest european subsidiary garmin europe ltd remains the us dollar and as some transactions occurred in british pounds sterling or euros foreign currency gains or losses have been realized historically related to the movements of those currencies relative to the us dollar the company believes that gains and losses will become more material in the future as our european presence grows in 2011 the us dollar strengthened 13 relative to the euro resulting in a foreign currency loss of 48 million in garmin ltd and our european subsidiaries the us dollar weakened 12 against the taiwan dollar resulting in a 41 million foreign currency loss due to the fluctuation of asset balances throughout the year the net result of these currency moves combined with other losses of 32 million and the timing of transactions during the year was a net loss of 121 million for the company and a cumulative translation adjustment of 760 million at the end of fiscal 2011 

 

interest rate risk 

 

we have no outstanding longterm debt as of december 31 2011 we therefore have no meaningful debtrelated interest rate risk

company overview 

garmin is a leading worldwide provider of navigation communication and information devices and applications most of which are enabled by global positioning system “gps” technology garmin designs develops manufactures and markets a diverse family of handheld portable and fixedmount gpsenabled products and other navigation communications and information products for the automotivemobile outdoorfitness marine and general aviation markets 

overview of the global positioning system 

the global positioning system is a worldwide navigation system which enables the precise determination of geographic location using established satellite technology the system consists of a constellation of orbiting satellites the satellites and their ground control and monitoring stations are maintained and operated by the united states department of defense which maintains an ongoing satellite replenishment program to ensure continuous global system coverage access to the system is provided free of charge by the us government 

prior to may 2000 the us department of defense intentionally degraded the accuracy of civilian gps signals in a process known as selective availability ‘‘sa’’ for national security purposes sa variably degraded gps position accuracy to a radius of 100 meters on may 2 2000 the us department of defense discontinued sa in a presidential policy statement issued in december 2004 the bush administration indicated that the us does not intend to implement sa again and is committed to preventing hostile use of gps through regional denial of service minimizing the impact to peaceful users with sa removed a gps receiver can calculate its position to an accuracy of approximately 10 meters or less enhancing the utility of gps for most applications 

the accuracy and utility of gps can be enhanced through augmentation techniques which compute any remaining errors in the signal and broadcast these corrections to a gps device the federal aviation administration “faa” has developed a wide area augmentation system ‘‘waas’’ comprising ground reference stations and additional satellites that improve the accuracy of gps positioning available in the united states and portions of canada and mexico to approximately 3 meters waas supports the use of gps as the primary means of enroute terminal and approach navigation for aviation in the united states the increased accuracy offered by waas also enhances the utility of waasenabled gps receivers for consumer applications the faa announced on july 11 2003 that the waas system had achieved initial operating capability and that the system was available for instrument flight use with appropriately certified avionics equipment since that time the faa has installed additional ground reference stations and has launched additional waas satellites 

japan’s mtsatbased satellite augmentation system msas achieved initial operating capability for en route terminal and approach navigation for aviation in september 27 2007 garmin is working closely with the european satellite services provider essp in preparation for the european geostationary navigation overlay service egnos aviation safety of life sol service declaration which is planned in 2011

below is a table of garmin’s expenditures on research and development over the last three fiscal years 

 

manufacturing and operations 

garmin believes that one of its core competencies and strengths is its manufacturing capability at its sijhih jhongli and linkou taiwan facilities its olathe kansas facility and its salem oregon facility garmin believes that its vertically integrated approach has provided it the following benefits with respect to all products other than the legacy nüvifone products which are manufactured by one or more third parties as part of the garminasus strategic alliance a few select marine products vhf radios and ais receivers and our accessory products all of which are also manufactured by one or more third parties 

reduced timetomarket utilizing concurrent engineering techniques garmin’s products are introduced to production at an early development stage and the feedback provided by manufacturing is incorporated into the design before mass production begins in this manner garmin attempts to reduce the time required to move a product from its design phase to mass production deliveries 

design and process optimization garmin uses its manufacturing resources to rapidly prototype design concepts products and processes in order to achieve higher efficiency improved quality and yields lower cost and better value for customers garmin’s ability to fully explore product design and manufacturing process concepts has enabled it to optimize its designs to minimize size and weight in gps devices that are functional waterproof and rugged 

logistical agility operating our own manufacturing facilities helps garmin minimize problems such as component shortages and long component lead times which are common in the electronics industry many products can be reengineered to bypass component shortages or reduce cost and the new designs can be delivered to market quickly garmin reacts rapidly to changes in market demand by striving to maintain a safety stock of longlead components and by rescheduling components from one product line to another operating our own manufacturing facilities also allows garmin to quickly adjust the mix of product production helping to foster faster delivery response to the customer 

garmin’s design manufacturing distribution and servicing processes in our us taiwan and uk facilities are certified to iso 9001 an international quality standard developed by the international organization for standardization garmin’s taiwan manufacturing facilities have also achieved ts 16949 certification a quality standard for automotive suppliers in addition garmin’s aviation operations have achieved certification to as9100 the quality standard for the aviation industry 

garmin europe ltd and garmin corporation have also achieved certification of their environmental management systems to the iso14001 standard this certification recognizes that garmin’s uk and taiwan subsidiaries have systems and processes in place to minimize or prevent harmful effects on the environment and to strive continually to improve its environmental performance 

materials 

although most components essential to garmin’s business are generally available from multiple sources certain key components including but not limited to microprocessors certain liquid crystal displays “lcds” and certain applicationspecific integrated circuits “asics” are currently obtained by the company from single or limited sources which subjects garmin to supply and pricing risks many of these and other key components that are available from multiple sources including but not limited to nand flash memory dynamic random access memory “dram” gps chipsets and certain lcds are subject at times to industrywide shortages and commodity pricing fluctuations 

  

  

garmin and other participants in the personal computer mobile communication aviation electronics and consumer electronics industries also compete for various components with other industries that have experienced increased demand for their products in addition garmin uses some custom components that are not common to the rest of the personal computer mobile communication and consumer electronics industries and new products introduced by the company often utilize custom components available from only one source until garmin has evaluated whether there is a need for and subsequently qualifies additional suppliers when a component or product uses new technologies initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields have matured or manufacturing capacity has increased garmin makes efforts to manage risks in these areas through the use of supply agreements for strategically important components nevertheless if garmin’s supply of a key singlesourced component for a new or existing product were delayed or constrained if such components were available only at significantly higher prices or if a key manufacturing vendor delayed shipments of completed products to garmin the garmin’s financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected garmin’s business and financial performance could also be adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the original source or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source continued availability of these components at acceptable prices or at all may be affected if those suppliers decided to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the garmin’s requirements 

seasonality 

our sales are subject to significant seasonal fluctuation sales of our consumer products are generally significantly higher in the fourth quarter due to increased demand for automotivemobile products during the holiday buying season and to a lesser extent the second quarter due to increased demand during the spring and summer marine season and the father’s daygraduation buying season sales of consumer products are also influenced by the timing of the release of new products our aviation products do not experience much seasonal variation but are more influenced by the timing of the release of new products when the initial demand is typically the strongest 

backlog 

our sales are generally of a consumer nature and there is a relatively short cycle between order and shipment therefore we believe that backlog information is not material to the understanding of our business we typically ship most orders within 72 hours of receipt 

intellectual property 

our success and ability to compete is dependent in part on our proprietary technology we rely on a combination of patent copyright trademark and trade secret laws as well as confidentiality agreements to establish and protect our proprietary rights in addition garmin often relies on licenses of intellectual property for use in its business for example garmin obtains licenses for digital cartography technology for use in our products from various sources 

as of january 21 2010 garmin’s worldwide ip portfolio includes over 450 patents and 300 trademark registrations garmin was selected as a constituent of the 20102011 ocean tomo ® 300 patent index which recognizes companies with high intellectual property value we believe that our continued success depends on the intellectual skills of our employees and their ability to continue to innovate garmin will continue to file and prosecute patent applications when appropriate to attempt to protect garmin’s rights in its proprietary technologies 

 

  

  

there is no assurance that our current patents or patents which we may later acquire may successfully withstand any challenge in whole or in part it is also possible that any patent issued to us may not provide us with any competitive advantages or that the patents of others will preclude us from manufacturing and marketing certain products despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights to protect our trade secrets to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others or to defend against claims of infringement or invalidity 

regulations 

the telecommunications industry is highly regulated and the regulatory environment in which garmin operates is subject to change in accordance with federal communications commission “fcc” rules and regulations wireless transceiver and cellular handset products are required to be certified by the fcc and comparable authorities in foreign countries where they are sold garmin’s products sold in europe are required to comply with relevant directives of the european commission a delay in receiving required certifications for new products or enhancements to garmin’s products or losing certification for garmin’s existing products could adversely affect our business in addition aviation products that are intended for installation in “type certificated aircraft” are required to be certified by the faa its european counterpart the european aviation safety agency and other comparable organizations before they can be used in an aircraft 

because garmin corporation one of the company’s principal subsidiaries is located in taiwan foreign exchange control laws and regulations of taiwan with respect to remittances into and out of taiwan may have an impact on garmin’s operations the taiwan foreign exchange control statute and regulations thereunder provide that all foreign exchange transactions must be executed by banks designated to handle such business by the ministry of finance of taiwan and by the central bank of the republic of china taiwan also referred to as the cbc current regulations favor traderelated foreign exchange transactions consequently foreign currency earned from exports of merchandise and services may now be retained and used freely by exporters while all foreign currency needed for the import of merchandise and services may be purchased freely from the designated foreign exchange banks aside from traderelated foreign exchange transactions taiwan companies and residents may without foreign exchange approval remit outside and into taiwan foreign currencies of up to 50 million and 5 million respectively or their equivalent each calendar year currency conversions within the limits are processed by the designated banks and do not have to be reviewed and approved by the cbc the above limits apply to remittances involving a conversion between new taiwan dollars and us dollars or other foreign currencies the cbc typically approves foreign exchange in excess of the limits if a party applies with the cbc for review and presents legitimate business reasons justifying the currency conversion a requirement is also imposed on all enterprises to register all medium and longterm foreign debt with the cbc 

environmental matters 

garmin’s operations are subject to various environmental laws including laws addressing air and water pollution and management of hazardous substances and wastes substantial noncompliance with applicable environmental laws could have a material adverse effect on our business currently we do not anticipate material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities 

environmental regulation of garmin’s products is increasing many of garmins products are subject to laws relating to the chemical and material composition of our products and their energy efficiency garmin is also subject to laws requiring manufacturers to be financially responsible for collection recovery and recycling of wastes from certain electronic products compliance with current environmental laws does not have a material impact on our business but the impact of future enactment of environmental laws cannot yet be fully determined and could be substantial 

 

garmin has implemented multiple environmental management system “ems” policies in accordance with the international organization for standardization iso 14001 standard for environmental health and safety management garmin’s ems policies set forth practices standards and procedures to ensure compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations at garmin’s kansas headquarters facility garmin’s european headquarters facility and garmin’s taiwan manufacturing facility 

  

  

 

regulatory and “green procurement” demands from our customers are also increasing particularly in the areas of restricted substance use and environmentallyfriendly design and manufacture initiatives the overall impacts of these customer requirements cannot yet be established garmin is committed to improving our products and processes to meet our customer needs 

employees 

as of december 25 2010 garmin had 8897 full and parttime employees worldwide of whom 3470 were in the united states 72 were in canada 4419 were in taiwan 725 were in europe and 211 were in other global locations except for some of garmin’s employees in brazil and sweden none of garmin’s employees are represented by a labor union and none of garmins north american or taiwan employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement garmin considers its employee relations to be good 




 item 1a risk factors 

the risks described below are not the only ones facing our company additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also impair our business operations if any of the following risks occur our business financial condition or operating results could be materially adversely affected 

risks related to the company 

 

the demand for personal navigation devices pnds may be eroded by replacement technologies becoming available on mobile handsets and factoryinstalled systems in new autos 

we have historically experienced substantial growth in the automotivemobile segment which has resulted in gpsnavigation technologies being incorporated into competing devices such as mobile handsets and new automobiles through factoryinstalled systems mobile handsets are frequently gpsenabled and many companies are now offering navigation software for mobile devices the acceptance of this technology by consumers has halted our growth and could further reduce margins navigation systems are also becoming more prevalent as optional equipment on new automobiles increased navigation penetration on new automobiles could cause further declines in sales of our portable navigation devices and further reduce margins 

our financial results are highly dependent on the automotivemobile segment which represents approximately 62 of our revenues and is maturing 

  we have historically experienced substantial growth in the automotivemobile segment of our business as the products have become massmarket consumer electronics in both europe and north america this market has peaked as penetration rates increase and competing technologies emerge this has resulted in lower revenues and lower earnings per share 

economic conditions and uncertainty could adversely affect our revenue and margins 

our revenue and margins depend significantly on general economic conditions and the demand for products in the markets in which we compete the current economic weakness and constrained consumer and business spending has resulted in decreased revenue and in the future could result in decreased revenue and problems with our ability to manage inventory levels and collect customer receivables in addition financial difficulties experienced by our retailer and oem customers have resulted and could result in the future in significant bad debt writeoffs and additions to reserves in our receivables and could have an adverse affect on our results of operations 

 

  

  

gross margins for our products may fluctuate or erode 

gross margins on our automotivemobile products have been declining and are expected to decline in 2011 due to price reductions in the increasingly competitive market for personal navigation devices pnds that are not fully offset by material cost reductions in addition our overall gross margin may fluctuate from period to period due to a number of factors including product mix competition and unit volumes in particular the average selling prices of a specific product tend to decrease over that product’s life to offset such decreases we intend to rely primarily on component cost reduction obtaining yield improvements and corresponding cost reductions in the manufacture of existing products and on introducing new products that incorporate advanced features and therefore can be sold at higher average selling prices however there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain any such yield improvements or cost reductions or introduce any such new products in the future to the extent that such cost reductions and new product introductions do not occur in a timely manner or our products do not achieve market acceptance our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

 

changes in our united states federal income tax classification or in applicable tax law could result in adverse tax consequences to our shareholders 

we do not believe that we or any of our nonunited states subsidiaries are currently a ‘‘passive foreign investment company’’ for united states federal income tax purposes we do not expect to become a passive foreign investment company however because the passive foreign investment company determination is made annually based on whether the company’s income or assets meet certain thresholds as determined under united states federal tax principles which are based on facts and circumstances that may be beyond our control we cannot assure that we will not become a passive foreign investment company in the future if we are a passive foreign investment company in any year then any of our shareholders that is a united states person could be liable to pay tax on their pro rata share of our income plus an interest charge upon some distributions by us or when that shareholder sells our common shares at a gain further if we are classified as a passive foreign investment company in any year in which a united states person is a shareholder we generally will continue to be treated as a passive foreign investment company with respect to such shareholder in all succeeding years regardless of whether we continue to satisfy the income or asset tests mentioned above 

 

we do not believe that we or any of our nonunited states subsidiaries are currently a controlled foreign corporation cfc for united states federal income tax purposes we do not expect to become a cfc the cfc determination is made daily based on whether the united states shareholders own more than fifty percent of the voting power or value of the company only united states persons that own ten percent or more of the voting power of the company’s shares qualify as united states shareholders if the company were to be classified as a cfc for an uninterrupted thirty day period in any year the company’s shareholders that qualify as united states shareholders could be liable to pay us income tax at ordinary income tax rates on their prorata share of certain categories of the company’s income for the period in which the company is classified as a cfc as the company cannot control the ownership of the company’s stock nor can the company control which shareholders participate in the company’s stock buyback program ownership changes could result that create united states shareholders which increase the risk of garmin being treated as a cfc 

 

legislative proposals have been considered in the united states within the past year that could increase the united states tax burden of corporations with international operations and could broaden the circumstances under which foreign corporations could be considered resident in the united states our tax position could be adversely impacted by changes in united states or foreign tax laws tax treaties or tax regulations or the interpretation or enforcement thereof by any tax authority we cannot predict the outcome of any specific legislative proposals 

  

  

 

if we are not successful in the continued development introduction or timely manufacture of new products demand for our products could decrease 

we expect that a significant portion of our future revenue will continue to be derived from sales of newly introduced products the market for our products is characterized by rapidly changing technology evolving industry standards and changes in customer needs if we fail to introduce new products or to modify or improve our existing products in response to changes in technology industry standards or customer needs our products could rapidly become less competitive or obsolete we must continue to make significant investments in research and development in order to continue to develop new products enhance existing products and achieve market acceptance for such products however there can be no assurance that development stage products will be successfully completed or if developed will achieve significant customer acceptance 

if we are unable to successfully develop and introduce competitive new products and enhance our existing products our future results of operations would be adversely affected our pursuit of necessary technology may require substantial time and expense we may need to license new technologies to respond to technological change these licenses may not be available to us on terms that we can accept or may materially change the gross profits that we are able to obtain on our products we may not succeed in adapting our products to new technologies as they emerge development and manufacturing schedules for technology products are difficult to predict and there can be no assurance that we will achieve timely initial customer shipments of new products the timely availability of these products in volume and their acceptance by customers are important to our future success from time to time we have experienced delays in shipping certain of our new products and any future delays whether due to product development delays manufacturing delays lack of market acceptance delays in regulatory approval or otherwise could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

if we are unable to compete effectively with existing or new competitors our resulting loss of competitive position could result in price reductions fewer customer orders reduced margins and loss of market share 

the markets for our products are highly competitive and we expect competition to increase in the future some of our competitors have significantly greater financial technical and marketing resources than we do these competitors may be able to respond more rapidly to new or emerging technologies or changes in customer requirements they may also be able to devote greater resources to the development promotion and sale of their products increased competition could result in price reductions fewer customer orders reduced margins and loss of market share our failure to compete successfully against current or future competitors could seriously harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

we rely on independent dealers and distributors to sell our products and disruption to these channels would harm our business 

because we sell a majority of our products to independent dealers and distributors we are subject to many risks including risks related to their inventory levels and support for our products in particular our dealers and distributors maintain significant levels of our products in their inventories if dealers and distributors attempt to reduce their levels of inventory or if they do not maintain sufficient levels to meet customer demand our sales could be negatively impacted 

many of our dealers and distributors also sell products offered by our competitors if our competitors offer our dealers and distributors more favorable terms those dealers and distributors may deemphasize or decline to carry our products in the future we may not be able to retain or attract a sufficient number of qualified dealers and distributors if we are unable to maintain successful relationships with dealers and distributors or to expand our distribution channels our business will suffer 

  

  

our quarterly operating results are subject to fluctuations and seasonality 

our operating results are difficult to predict our future quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly if such operating results decline the price of our stock would likely decline as we expand our operations our operating expenses particularly our advertising and research and development costs may increase as a percentage of our sales if revenues decrease and we are unable to reduce those costs rapidly our operating results would be negatively affected 

historically our revenues have been weaker in the first quarter of each fiscal year and have recently been lower than the preceding fourth quarter our devices are highly consumeroriented and consumer buying is traditionally lower in these quarters sales of certain of our marine and automotive   products tend to be higher in our second fiscal quarter due to increased consumer spending for such products during the recreational marine fishing and travel season sales of our automotivemobile products also have been higher in our fourth fiscal quarter due to increased consumer spending patterns on electronic devices during the holiday season   in addition we attempt to time our new product releases to coincide with relatively higher consumer spending in the second and fourth fiscal quarters which contributes to these seasonal variations 

our quarterly financial statements will reflect fluctuations in foreign currency translation 

the operation of garmin’s subsidiaries in international markets results in exposure to movements in currency exchange rates we have experienced significant foreign currency gains and losses due to the strengthening and weakening of the us dollar the potential of volatile foreign exchange rate fluctuations in the future could have a significant effect on our results of operations 

the currencies that create a majority of the company’s exchange rate exposure are the taiwan dollar euro and british pound sterling garmin corporation headquartered in sijhih taiwan uses the local currency as the functional currency the company translates all assets and liabilities at yearend exchange rates and income and expense accounts at average rates during the year in order to minimize the effect of the currency exchange fluctuations on our net assets we have elected to retain most of our taiwan subsidiary’s cash and investments in marketable securities denominated in us dollars 

nonetheless us gaap requires the company at the end of each accounting period to translate into taiwan dollars all such us dollar denominated assets held by our taiwan subsidiary this translation is required because the taiwan dollar is the functional currency of the subsidiary this us gaapmandated translation will cause us to recognize gain or loss on our financial statements as the taiwan dollarus dollar exchange rate varies such gain or loss will create variations in our earnings per share because there is minimal cash impact caused by such exchange rate variations management will continue to focus on the company’s operating performance before the impact of the foreign currency translation 

if we do not correctly anticipate demand for our products we may not be able to secure sufficient quantities or costeffective production of our products or we could have costly excess production or inventories 

we have generally been able to increase production to meet this increasing demand however the demand for our products depends on many factors and will be difficult to forecast we expect that it will become more difficult to forecast demand as we introduce and support multiple products as competition in the market for our products intensifies and as the markets for some of our products mature to the mass market category significant unanticipated fluctuations in demand could cause the following problems in our operations 

 

  

  

 

 

we have benefited in the past from taiwan government tax incentives offered on certain high technology capital investments that may not always be available 

our effective tax rate is lower than the us federal statutory rate in part because we have benefited from incentives offered in taiwan related to our high technology investments in taiwan the loss of these tax benefits could have a significant effect on our financial results in the future 

 

we may experience unique economic and political risks associated with companies that operate in taiwan 

relations between taiwan and the people’s republic of china also referred to as the prc and other factors affecting the political or economic conditions of taiwan in the future could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations and the market price and the liquidity of our shares our principal manufacturing facilities where we manufacture all of our products except our panelmounted aviation products are located in taiwan 

taiwan has a unique international political status the prc asserts sovereignty over all of china including taiwan certain other islands and all of mainland china the prc government does not recognize the legitimacy of the taiwan government although significant economic and cultural relations have been established during recent years between taiwan and the prc the prc government has indicated that it may use military force to gain control over taiwan in certain circumstances such as the declaration of independence by taiwan relations between taiwan and the prc have on occasion adversely affected the market value of taiwanese companies and could negatively affect our operations in taiwan in the future 

our intellectual property rights are important to our operations and we could suffer loss if they infringe upon other’s rights or are infringed upon by others 

we rely on a combination of patents copyrights trademarks and trade secrets confidentiality provisions and licensing arrangements to establish and protect our proprietary rights to this end we hold rights to a number of patents and registered trademarks and regularly file applications to attempt to protect our rights in new technology and trademarks however there is no guarantee that our patent applications will become issued patents or that our trademark applications will become registered trademarks moreover even if approved our patents or trademarks may thereafter be successfully challenged by others or otherwise become invalidated for a variety of reasons thus any patents or trademarks we currently have or may later acquire may not provide us a significant competitive advantage 

third parties may claim that we are infringing their intellectual property rights such claims could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition from time to time we receive letters alleging infringement of patents trademarks or other intellectual property rights litigation concerning patents or other intellectual property is costly and time consuming we may seek licenses from such parties but they could refuse to grant us a license or demand commercially unreasonable terms we might not have sufficient resources to pay for the licenses such infringement claims could also cause us to incur substantial liabilities and to suspend or permanently cease the use of critical technologies or processes or the production or sale of major products 

  

  

we may become subject to significant product liability costs 

if our aviation products malfunction or contain errors or defects airplane collisions or crashes could occur resulting in property damage personal injury or death malfunctions or errors or defects in our marine navigational products could cause boats to run aground or cause other wreckage personal injury or death if our automotive or marine products contain defects or errors in the mapping supplied by thirdparty map providers or if our users do not heed our warnings about the proper use of these products collisions or accidents could occur resulting in property damage personal injury or death if any of these events occurs we could be subject to significant liability for personal injury and property damage and under certain circumstances could be subject to a judgment for punitive damages we maintain insurance against accidentrelated risks involving our products however there can be no assurance that such insurance would be sufficient to cover the cost of damages to others or that such insurance will continue to be available at commercially reasonable rates in addition insurance coverage generally will not cover awards of punitive damages and may not cover the cost of associated legal fees and defense costs which could result in lower margins if we are unable to maintain sufficient insurance to cover product liability costs or if our insurance coverage does not cover the award this could have a materially adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we depend on our suppliers some of which are the sole source for specific components and our production would be seriously harmed if these suppliers are not able to meet our demand and alternative sources are not available or if the costs of components rise 

we are dependent on third party suppliers for various components used in our current products some of the components that we procure from third party suppliers include semiconductors and electroluminescent panels liquid crystal displays memory chips batteries and microprocessors the cost quality and availability of components are essential to the successful production and sale of our products some components we use are from sole source suppliers certain applicationspecific integrated circuits incorporating our proprietary designs are manufactured for us by sole source suppliers alternative sources may not be currently available for these sole source components 

in the past we have experienced shortages of liquid crystal displays and other components in addition if there are shortages in supply of components the costs of such components may rise if suppliers are unable to meet our demand for components on a timely basis and if we are unable to obtain an alternative source or if the price of the alternative source is prohibitive or if the costs of components rise our ability to maintain timely and costeffective production of our products would be seriously harmed 

we depend on third party licensors for the digital map data contained in our automotivemobile products and our business andor gross margins could be harmed if we become unable to continue licensing such mapping data or if the royalty costs for such data rise 

we license digital mapping data for use in our products from various sources there are only a limited number of suppliers of mapping data for each geographical region the two largest digital map suppliers are navteq corporation and tele atlas nv navteq corporation is owned by nokia oyj and tele atlas nv is owned by tomtom nv nokia and tomtom are both competitors of garmin 

although we do not foresee difficulty in continuing to license data at favorable pricing due to the long term license extension signed between garmin and navteq in november 2007 extending our navteq license agreement through 2017 with an option to extend through 2021 if we are unable to continue licensing such mapping data and are unable to obtain an alternative source or if the nature of our relationships with navteq changes detrimentally our ability to supply mapping data for use in our products would be seriously harmed 

 

  

  

we may pursue strategic acquisitions investments strategic partnerships or other ventures and our business could be materially harmed if we fail to successfully identify complete and integrate such transactions 

we intend to evaluate acquisition opportunities and opportunities to make investments in complementary businesses technologies services or products or to enter into strategic partnerships with parties who can provide access to those assets additional product or services offerings additional distribution or marketing synergies or additional industry expertise we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition investment or strategic partnership candidates or if we do identify suitable candidates in the future we may not be able to complete those transactions on commercially favorable terms or at all 

any past or future acquisitions could also result in difficulties assimilating acquired employees including cultural differences with foreign acquisitions operations and products and diversion of capital and management’s attention away from other business issues and opportunities integration of acquired companies may result in problems related to integration of technology and inexperienced management teams in addition the key personnel of the acquired company may decide not to work for us we may not successfully integrate internal controls compliance under the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 and other corporate governance matters operations personnel or products related to acquisitions we have made in previous years or may make in the future if we fail to successfully integrate such transactions our business could be materially harmed 

we may have additional tax liabilities 

we are subject to income taxes in both the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes in the ordinary course of our business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain we are regularly under audit by tax authorities although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals the results of an audit or litigation could have a material effect on our income tax provision net income or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made 

failure to obtain required certifications of our products on a timely basis could harm our business 

we have certain products especially in our aviation segment that are subject to governmental and similar certifications before they can be sold for example faa certification is required for all of our aviation products that are intended for installation in type certificated aircraft to the extent required certification is an expensive and timeconsuming process that requires significant focus and resources an inability to obtain or excessive delay in obtaining such certifications could have an adverse effect on our ability to introduce new products and for certain aviation oem products our customers’ ability to sell airplanes therefore such inabilities or delays could adversely affect our operating results   in addition we cannot assure you that our certified products will not be decertified any such decertification could have an adverse effect on our operating results 

our business may suffer if we are not able to hire and retain sufficient qualified personnel or if we lose our key personnel 

our future success depends partly on the continued contribution of our key executive engineering sales marketing manufacturing and administrative personnel we currently do not have employment agreements with any of our key executive officers we do not have key man life insurance on any of our key executive officers and do not currently intend to obtain such insurance the loss of the services of any of our senior level management or other key employees could harm our business recruiting and retaining the skilled personnel we require to maintain and grow our market position may be difficult for example in some recent years there has been a nationwide shortage of qualified electrical engineers and software engineers who are necessary for us to design and develop new products and therefore it has sometimes been challenging to recruit such personnel if we fail to hire and retain qualified employees we may not be able to maintain and expand our business 

  

  

there is uncertainty as to our shareholders’ ability to enforce certain foreign civil liabilities in switzerland and taiwan 

we are a swiss company and a substantial portion of our assets are located outside the united states particularly in taiwan as a result it may be difficult to effect service of process within the united states upon us in addition there is uncertainty as to whether the courts of switzerland or taiwan would recognize or enforce judgments of united states courts obtained against us predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the united states or any state thereof or be competent to hear original actions brought in switzerland or taiwan against us predicated upon the securities laws of the united states or any state thereof 

a shut down of us airspace or imposition of restrictions on general aviation would harm our business 

following the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks the faa ordered all aircraft operating in the us to be grounded for several days in addition to this shut down of us airspace the general aviation industry was further impacted by the additional restrictions implemented by the faa on those flights that fly utilizing visual flight rules vfr the faa restricted vfr flight inside 30 enhanced class b a 2025 mile radius around the 30 largest metropolitan areas in the usa airspace areas the aircraft owners and pilots association aopa estimated that these restrictions affected approximately 41800 general aviation aircraft based at 282 airports inside the 30 enhanced class b airspace areas the aopa estimates that approximately 90 of all general aviation flights are conducted vfr and that only 15 of general aviation pilots are current to fly utilizing instrument flight rules ifr 

the shutdown of us airspace following september 11 2001 caused reduced sales of our general aviation products and delays in the shipment of our products manufactured in our taiwan manufacturing facility to our distribution facility in olathe kansas thereby adversely affecting our ability to supply new and existing products to our dealers and distributors 

any future shut down of us airspace or imposition of restrictions on general aviation could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results 

many of our products rely on the global positioning system 

the global positioning system is a satellitebased navigation and positioning system consisting of a constellation of orbiting satellites the satellites and their ground control and monitoring stations are maintained and operated by the united states department of defense the department of defense does not currently charge users for access to the satellite signals these satellites and their ground support systems are complex electronic systems subject to electronic and mechanical failures and possible sabotage the satellites were originally designed to have lives of 75 years and are subject to damage by the hostile space environment in which they operate however of the current deployment of satellites in place some have been operating for more than 12 years 

if a significant number of satellites were to become inoperable unavailable or are not replaced it would impair the current utility of our global positioning system products and would have a material negative effect on our business in addition there can be no assurance that the us government will remain committed to the operation and maintenance of global positioning system satellites over a long period or that the policies of the us government that provide for the use of the global positioning system without charge and without accuracy degradation will remain unchanged because of the increasing commercial applications of the global positioning system other us government agencies may become involved in the administration or the regulation of the use of global positioning system signals however in a presidential policy statement issued in december 2004 the bush administration indicated that the us is committed to supporting and improving the global positioning system and will continue providing it free from direct user fees 

some of our products also use signals from systems that augment gps such as the wide area augmentation system waas waas is operated by the faa any curtailment of the operating capability of waas could result in decreased user capability for many of our aviation products thereby impacting our markets 

 

 

 

any of the foregoing factors could affect the willingness of buyers of our products to select global positioning systembased products instead of products based on competing technologies 

 

any reallocation or repurposing of radio frequency spectrum could cause harmful interference with the reception of global positioning system signals this interference could harm our business 

our global positioning system technology is dependent on the use of the standard positioning service sps provided by the us government’s global positioning system satellites the global positioning system operates in radio frequency bands that are globally allocated for radio navigation satellite services international allocations of radio frequency are made by the international telecommunications union itu a specialized technical agency of the united nations these allocations are further governed by radio regulations that have treaty status and which may be subject to modification every two to three years by the world radio communication conference each country also has regulatory authority on how each band is used in the united states the federal communications commission fcc and the national telecommunications and information administration share responsibility for radio frequency allocations and spectrum usage regulations 

any itu or national reallocation of radio frequency spectrum including frequency band segmentation or sharing of spectrum or other modifications of the permitted uses of relevant frequency bands may materially and adversely affect the utility and reliability of our products and have significant negative impacts on our business and our customers for example the fcc is currently considering a proposal by a private party lightsquared to repurpose spectrum adjacent to the gps bands for terrestrial broadband wireless operations in metropolitan areas throughout the united states if the fcc were to permit implementation of lightsquared’s proposal as is terrestrial broadband wireless operations would create harmful interference to gps receivers within range of such operations   

our business is subject to disruptions and uncertainties caused by war or terrorism 

acts of war or acts of terrorism especially any directed at the gps signals could have a material adverse impact on our business operating results and financial condition the threat of terrorism and war and heightened security and military response to this threat or any future acts of terrorism may cause a redeployment of the satellites used in gps or interruptions of the system to the extent that such interruptions have an effect on sales of our products this could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

we may be exposed to certain regulatory and financial risks related to climate change 

 

climate change is receiving increasing attention worldwide some scientists legislators and others attribute global warming to increased levels of greenhouse gases including carbon dioxide which has led to significant legislative and regulatory efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions 

 

there are a number of pending legislative and regulatory proposals to address greenhouse gas emissions for example in june 2009 the us house of representatives passed the american clean energy and security act that would phasein significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions if enacted into law the us senate is considering one or more different bills and it is uncertain whether when and in what form a federal mandatory carbon dioxide emissions reduction program may be adopted similarly certain countries have adopted the kyoto protocol these actions could increase costs associated with our operations including costs for components used in the manufacture of our products and freight costs 

because it is uncertain what laws and regulations will be enacted we cannot predict the potential impact of such laws and regulations on our future consolidated financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

 

 

 

 

risks relating to our shares 

 

the volatility of our stock price could adversely affect investment in our common shares 

the market price of our common shares has been and may continue to be highly volatile during 2010 the price of our common shares ranged from a low of 2655 to a high of 3994 a variety of factors could cause the price of our common shares to fluctuate perhaps substantially including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in addition in recent years the stock market in general and the markets for shares of technology companies in particular have experienced extreme price fluctuations which have often been unrelated to the operating performance of affected companies any such fluctuations in the future could adversely affect the market price of our common shares 

 

our officers and directors exert substantial influence over us 

as of january 14 2011 members and former members of our board of directors and our executive officers together with members of their families and entities that may be deemed affiliates of or related to such persons or entities beneficially owned approximately 4480 of our outstanding common shares accordingly these shareholders may be able to determine the outcome of corporate actions requiring shareholder approval such as mergers and acquisitions this level of ownership may have a significant effect in delaying deferring or preventing a change in control of garmin and may adversely affect the voting and other rights of other holders of our common shares 

on june 27 2010 we completed the redomestication of the place of our incorporation from the cayman islands to switzerland the “redomestication” as a result of increased shareholder approval requirements under swiss law we have less flexibility than we previously had as a cayman islands company with respect to certain aspects of capital management 

swiss law allows our shareholders acting at a shareholders’ meeting to authorize share capital that can be issued by the board of directors without approval of a shareholders’ meeting but this authorization is limited to 50 of the existing registered share capital and must be renewed by a shareholders’ meeting every two years additionally subject to specified exceptions including the exceptions described in our articles of association swiss law grants preemptive rights to existing shareholders to subscribe for new issuances of shares and other securities swiss law does not provide as much flexibility as cayman islands law in the various terms that can attach to different classes of shares either for example while the board of directors of a cayman islands company can authorize the issuance of preferred stock without shareholder approval we will not be able to issue preferred stock without the approval of 66 23 of the votes represented and a majority of the par value of the shares represented at a general meeting of our shareholders swiss law also reserves for approval by shareholders many corporate actions over which our board of directors previously had authority under cayman islands law for example dividends must be approved by shareholders at the general meeting of our shareholders 

  

  

 

the par value of our shares is higher following the redomestication as a result we have less flexibility than we previously had as a cayman islands company with respect to certain aspects of capital management 

the par value of our shares is 10 swiss francs per share compared to a par value of 0005 per share when we were a cayman islands company under swiss law we may not issue shares below par value in the event we need to raise equity capital at a time when the trading price of our shares is below the par value of the shares we will be unable to issue shares in addition we will not be able to issue options under our benefits plans with an exercise price below the par value which would limit the flexibility of our compensation arrangements 

we are subject to various swiss taxes following the redomestication 

although we do not expect swiss taxes to materially affect our worldwide effective corporate tax rate we are subject to additional corporate taxes in switzerland following the redomestication switzerland imposes a corporate federal income tax for holding companies at an effective tax rate of 783 although we should be entitled to a “participation relief” that in most cases will effectively eliminate any swiss taxation on the profits of our subsidiaries paid by them to us as dividends as well as on capital gains related to the sale of participations we also are subject to a swiss issuance stamp tax levied on our share issuances other than in connection with qualifying restructurings or increases of our equity at a rate of 1 of the fair market value of the issuance or increase in addition we are subject to some other swiss indirect taxes eg vat swiss issuance stamp tax on certain debt instruments and swiss securities transfer stamp tax 

 

we may not be able to make distributions or repurchase shares without subjecting you to swiss withholding tax 

if we are unable to make distributions if any through a reduction of par value or to pay dividends if any out of qualifying capital contribution reserves then any dividends paid by us will generally be subject to a swiss federal withholding tax at a rate of 35 the withholding tax must be withheld from the gross distribution and paid to the swiss federal tax administration a us holder that qualifies for benefits under the convention between the united states of america and the swiss confederation for the avoidance of double taxation with respect to taxes on income may apply for a refund of the tax withheld in excess of the 15 treaty rate or in excess of the 5 reduced treaty rate for qualifying corporate shareholders with at least 10 participation in our voting stock or for a full refund in case of qualified pension funds payment of a capital distribution in the form of a par value reduction is not subject to swiss withholding tax however there can be no assurance that our shareholders will approve a reduction in par value that we will be able to meet the other legal requirements for a reduction in par value or that swiss withholding rules will not be changed in the future in addition over the long term the amount of par value available for us to use for par value reductions will be limited if we are unable to make a distribution through a reduction in par value or to pay a dividend out of qualifying capital contribution reserves we may not be able to make distributions without subjecting you to swiss withholding taxes 

under swiss tax law applicable until december 31 2010 repurchases of shares for the purposes of capital reduction have been treated as a partial liquidation subject to 35 swiss withholding tax on the difference between the par value and the repurchase price on january 1 2011 under swiss laws the portion of the repurchase price that is attributed to the qualifying capital contribution reserves of the shares repurchased will not be subject to the swiss withholding tax we may follow a share repurchase process for future share repurchases if any similar to a second trading line on the swiss stock exchange in which swiss institutional investors buy shares on the open market and sell these shares to us and are generally able to receive a refund of the swiss withholding tax however if we are unable to use this process successfully we may not be able to repurchase shares for the purposes of capital reduction without subjecting you to swiss withholding taxes

overview 

 

we are a leading worldwide provider of navigation communications and information devices most of which are enabled by global positioning system or gps technology we operate in four business segments which serve the marine outdoorfitness automotivemobile and aviation markets our segments offer products through our network of subsidiary distributors and independent dealers and distributors however the nature of products and types of customers for the four segments can vary significantly as such the segments are managed separately our portable gps receivers and accessories for marine recreationfitness and automotivemobile segments are sold primarily to retail outlets our aviation products are portable and panelmount avionics for visual flight rules and instrument flight rules navigation and are sold primarily to retail outlets and certain aircraft manufacturers 

since our first products were delivered in 1991 we have generated positive income from operations each year and have funded our growth from these profits our sales have increased at a compounded annual growth rate of 11 since 2006 and our net income has increased at a compounded annual growth rate of 3 since 2006 the vast majority of this growth has been organic only a very small amount of new revenue occurred as a result of the acquisition of dynastream innovations inc in 2006 digital cyclone inc and the assets of nautamatic marine systems inc in 2007 eleven european distributors between 2007 and 2010 and metrigear inc in 2010 these acquisitions had no significant impact on net income for those years 

since our principal locations are in the united states taiwan and the uk we experience some foreign currency fluctuations in our operating results the table below provides a listing of our functional currency by subsidiary excluding the european subsidiaries that utilize the euro 

  

  

 

 

approximately 77 of sales by our european subsidiaries are now denominated in british pounds sterling or the euro we experienced 884 million 60 million and 353 million in foreign currency losses during fiscal years 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively the 2008 foreign currency loss includes a realized gain of 215 million due to the strengthening of the euro between the date we purchased shares in tele atlas nv in october 2007 and the tender of shares in february march and june 2008 to date we have not entered into hedging transactions related to any currency and we do not currently plan to utilize hedging transactions in the future 

 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

 

general 

 

garmin’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon garmin’s consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the presentation of these financial statements requires garmin to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis garmin evaluates its estimates including those related to customer sales programs and incentives product returns bad debts inventories investments intangible assets income taxes warranty obligations and contingencies and litigation garmin bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

revenue recognition 

 

garmin recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred the sales price is fixed or determinable and collection is probable for the large majority of garmin’s sales these criteria are met once product has shipped and title and risk of loss have transferred to the customer the company recognizes revenue from the sale of hardware products and software bundled with hardware that is essential to the functionality of the hardware in accordance with general revenue recognition accounting guidance the company recognizes revenue in accordance with industry specific software accounting guidance for standalone sales of software products and sales of software bundled with hardware not essential to the functionality of the hardware the company generally does not offer specified or unspecified upgrade rights to its customers in connection with software sales 

garmin introduced nümaps lifetime™ in january 2009 which is a single fee program that subject to the program’s terms and conditions enables customers to download the latest map and point of interest information every quarter for the useful life of their pnd the revenue and associated cost of royalties for sales of nümaps lifetime™ products are deferred at the time of sale and recognized ratably on a straightline basis over the currently estimated 36month life of the products 

  

  

 

for multipleelement arrangements that include tangible products that contain software essential to the tangible product’s functionality and undelivered software elements that relate to the tangible product’s essential software the company allocates revenue to all deliverables based on their relative selling prices in such circumstances the accounting principles establish a hierarchy to determine the selling price to be used for allocating revenue to deliverables as follows i vendorspecific objective evidence of fair value “vsoe” ii thirdparty evidence of selling price “tpe” and iii best estimate of the selling price “esp” vsoe generally exists only when the company sells the deliverable separately and is the price actually charged by the company for that deliverable in addition to the products listed below the company has offered certain other products that involve multipleelement arrangements that are immaterial 

in 2010 garmin began offering pnds with lifetime map updates lmu bundled in the original purchase price similar to nümaps lifetime™ which was introduced in january 2009 this enables customers to download the latest map and point of interest information every quarter for the useful life of their pnd the company has identified two deliverables contained in arrangements involving the sale of pnds including lmu the first deliverable is the hardware and software essential to the functionality of the hardware device delivered at the time of sale and the second deliverable is the lmu the company has allocated revenue between these two deliverables using the relative selling price method determined primarily using vsoe amounts allocated to the delivered hardware and the related essential software are recognized at the time of sale provided the other conditions for revenue recognition have been met amounts allocated to the lmu are deferred and recognized on a straightline basis over the estimated 36month life of the products 

in addition garmin offers pnds with premium traffic bundled in the original purchase price in the european market the company has identified two deliverables contained in arrangements involving the sale of pnds including premium traffic the first deliverable is the hardware and software essential to the functionality of the hardware device delivered at the time of sale and the second deliverable is the premium traffic service the company has allocated revenue between these two deliverables using the relative selling price method determined using vsoe amounts allocated to the delivered hardware and the related essential software are recognized at the time of sale provided the other conditions for revenue recognition have been met amounts allocated to the premium traffic service are deferred and recognized on a straightline basis over the estimated 36month life of the products 

in 2009 garmin introduced the nüvi 1690 a premium pnd with a builtin wireless module that lets customers access garmin’s nülink™ service which provides direct links to certain online information the company has identified two deliverables contained in arrangements involving the sale of the nüvi 1690 the first deliverable is the hardware and software essential to the functionality of the hardware device delivered at the time of sale and the second deliverable is the nülink service the company has allocated revenue between these two deliverables using the relative selling price method determined using vsoe amounts allocated to the delivered hardware and the related essential software are recognized at the time of sale provided the other conditions for revenue recognition have been met amounts allocated to the nülink services are deferred and recognized on a straightline basis over the 24month life of the service 

garmin records estimated reductions to revenue for customer sales programs returns and incentive offerings including rebates price protection product discounts offered to retailers to assist in clearing older products from their inventories in advance of new product releases promotions and other volumebased incentives the reductions to revenue are based on estimates and judgments using historical experience and expectation of future conditions changes in these estimates could negatively affect garmin’s operating results these incentives are reviewed periodically and with the exceptions of price protection and certain other promotions are accrued for on a percentage of sales basis if market conditions were to decline garmin may take actions to increase customer incentive offerings possibly resulting in an incremental reduction of revenue at the time the incentive is offered 

  

  

 

garmin records reductions to revenue for expected future product returns based on garmin’s historical experience 

 

trade accounts receivable 

we sell our products to retailers wholesalers and other customers and extend credit based on our evaluation of the customer’s financial condition potential losses on receivables are dependent on each individual customer’s financial condition we carry our trade accounts receivable at net realizable value typically our accounts receivable are collected within 80 days and do not bear interest we monitor our exposure to losses on receivables and maintain allowances for potential losses or adjustments we determine these allowances by 1 evaluating the aging of our receivables and 2 reviewing our highrisk customers past due receivable balances are written off when our internal collection efforts have been unsuccessful in collecting the amount due 

 

warranties 

 

garmin’s products are generally covered by a warranty for periods ranging from one to three years garmin accrues a warranty reserve for estimated costs to provide warranty services garmin’s estimate of costs to service its warranty obligations is based on historical experience and expectation of future conditions to the extent garmin experiences increased warranty claim activity or increased costs associated with servicing those claims its warranty accrual will increase resulting in decreased gross profit 

inventory 

 

garmin writes down its inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management additional inventory writedowns may be required 

investments 

investments are classified as available for sale and recorded at fair value and unrealized investment gains and losses are reflected in stockholders’ equity investment income is recorded when earned and capital gains and losses are recognized when investments are sold fair value of investments in auction rate securities are determined using third party estimates which followed an income approach valuation methodology investments are reviewed periodically to determine if they have suffered an impairment of value that is considered other than temporary if investments are determined to be impaired a capital loss is recognized at the date of determination 

testing for impairment of investments requires significant management judgment the identification of potentially impaired investments the determination of their fair value and the assessment of whether any decline in value is other than temporary are the key judgment elements the discovery of new information and the passage of time can significantly change these judgments revisions of impairment judgments are made when new information becomes known and any resulting impairment adjustments are made at that time the economic environment and volatility of securities markets increase the difficulty of determining fair value and assessing investment impairment 

income taxes 

 

garmin provides deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the difference between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their carrying amount for financial reporting purposes as measured by the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse it is garmin’s policy to record a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to an amount that it believes is more likely than not to be realized while garmin has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance in the event garmin were to determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax assets in the future an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such determination is made likewise should garmin determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase income in the period such determination is made 

  

  

 

in addition the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations we recognize liabilities for tax audit issues in the us and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes will be due if payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary if our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment a further charge to expense would result 

stock based compensation 

garmin awards stock options stock appreciation rights “sars” restricted stock units “rsus” andor performance shares each year as part of garmin’s compensation package for employees employees with certain levels of responsibility within garmin are eligible for stock options sar grants rsu grants andor performance shares but the granting of options sars rsus andor performance shares is at the discretion of the compensation committee of the board of directors and is not a contractual obligation 

stockbased compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period determining the fair value of stockbased awards at the grant date requires judgment including estimating expected dividends in addition judgment is also required in estimating the amount of stockbased awards that are expected to be forfeited if actual results differ significantly from these estimates stockbased compensation expense could be impacted stock compensation plans are discussed in detail in note 9 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

 

accounting terms and characteristics 

net sales 

 

our net sales are primarily generated through sales to our global dealer and distributor network and to original equipment manufacturers refer to the revenue recognition discussion above our sales are largely of a consumer nature therefore backlog levels are not necessarily indicative of our future sales results we aim to achieve a quick turnaround on orders we receive and we typically ship most orders within 72 hours 

 

net sales are subject to seasonal fluctuation typically sales of our consumer products are highest in the second quarter due to increased demand during the spring and summer season and in the fourth quarter due to increased demand during the holiday buying season our aviation products do not experience much seasonal variation but are more influenced by the timing of the release of new products when the initial demand is typically the strongest 

cost of salesgross profit 

 

raw material costs are our most significant component of cost of goods sold in 2010 gross margin for our automotivemobile segment declined 160 basis points as the average selling price declines outpaced raw material price declines in addition the deferral of high margin revenue and the related costs increased significantly as the product mix shifted toward products bundled with lifetime maps see note 2 for further information this was partially offset by a positive refinement in the warranty reserve in 2009 gross margin for our automotivemobile segment increased 350 basis points as benefits from raw material price declines and operating efficiencies exceeded the average selling price decline in 2008 gross margin for our automotivemobile segment declined 310 basis points as the average selling price continued to decline and we experienced further shift in product mix to lowermargin product groups these impacts were somewhat offset by raw material price declines most significantly flash memory gross margins for the aviation marine and outdoorfitness segments are more stable our longterm gross margin targets are 65 55 and 55 respectively for these segments 

  

  

 

our existing practice of performing the design and manufacture of our products inhouse has enabled us to utilize alternative lower cost components from different suppliers and where possible to redesign our products to permit us to use these lower cost components we believe that because of our practice of performing the design manufacture and marketing of our products inhouse our sijhih jhongli and linkou manufacturing plants in taiwan our olathe kansas and salem oregon manufacturing plants have experienced relatively low costs of manufacturing in general products manufactured in taiwan have been our highest volume products our manufacturing labor costs historically have been lower in taiwan than in olathe and salem 

 

sales price variability has had and can be expected to have an effect on our gross profit in the past prices of our devices sold into the automotivemobile market have declined due to market pressures and introduction of new products sold at lower price points the average selling prices of our aviation outdoorfitness and marine products have been stable due to product mix and the introduction of more advanced products sold at higher prices the effect of the sales price differences inherent within the mix of gpsenabled products sold could have a significant impact on our gross profit 

advertising expense 

 

our advertising expenses consist of costs for both media advertising and cooperative advertising with our retail partners as revenues grew in 2008 advertising expense also increased in 20092010 we reduced our advertising expense as revenues declined and the public became more aware of gps technology the reduction did not have a negative impact on our market share we expect advertising costs to decrease in 2011 as revenues decline 

selling general and administrative expenses 

our selling general and administrative expenses consist primarily of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

selling general and administrative expenses increased in 2010 due to legal costs fees associated with the swiss redomestication and growth in product support and information technology to support our growing installed base of users due to the economic pressure on our consumeroriented business we decreased selling general and administrative expenses in 2009 as revenues grew in 2008 selling general and administrative expenses increased we expect selling general and administrative costs excluding advertising to be stable or decline slightly in 2011 as revenues decline 

 

  

  

 

research and development 

 

the majority of our research and development costs represent salaries for our engineers costs for high technology components and costs of test equipment used in product and prototype development approximately 87 of the research and development of our products is performed in north america the remainder of our research and development activities is performed primarily by our taiwan engineering group 

 

we are committed to increasing the level of innovative design and development of new products as we strive for expanded ability to serve our existing consumer and aviation markets as well as new markets for gpsenabled devices we expect our research and development budget in absolute terms to be stable in 2011 

customers 

 

our top ten customers have contributed between 34 and 36 of net sales since 2008 we have experienced average sales days in our customer accounts receivable of between 70 and 78 days since 2008 we have experienced an increase in the level of customer accounts receivable days due to changes in product mix longer payment terms and macroeconomic conditions we expect to reduce the level of customer accounts receivable days as we negotiate shorter payment terms with our customers 

 

income taxes 

 

we have experienced a relatively low effective corporate tax rate due to the proportion of our revenue generated by entities in tax jurisdictions with low statutory rates in particular the profit entitlement afforded our swissbased companies based on their intellectual property rights ownership of our consumer products along with substantial tax incentives offered by the taiwanese government on certain hightechnology capital investments have continued to reduce our tax rate as a result our consolidated effective tax rate was approximately 13 during 2010 the negative rate was due to the impact of onetime items booked in 2010 the onetime items of 987 million include the release of uncertain tax position reserves from 2006 to 2008 related to our settlement with the irs in the us partially offset by the amount of the settlement for the 2007 tax year in the us and taiwan surtax expense due to the release of reserves without onetime items we would have reported an effective tax rate of 158 for 2010 compared to 129 for 2009 this increase resulted from an unfavorable mix of taxable income among the tax jurisdictions in which the company operates we have taken advantage of the tax benefit in taiwan since our inception and we expect to continue to benefit from lower effective tax rates at least through 2015 management believes that due to lower operating margins predicted for fiscal 2011 there may be slightly less revenue recognized by entities in lower tax rate jurisdictions therefore the effective tax rate for fiscal 2011 is expected to be higher than fiscal 2010 the actual effective tax rate will be dependent upon the operating margins production volume additional capital investments made during fiscal 2011 and the composition of our earnings

comparison of 52weeks ended december 25 2010 and december 26 2009 

net sales 

 

 

net sales decreased 9 in 2010 when compared to the yearago period the decrease occurred in automotivemobile and was partially offset by revenue growth in outdoorfitness marine and aviation the outdoorfitness segment experienced the greatest increase at 19 automotivemobile revenue remains the largest portion of our revenue mix but declined from 70 in 2009 to 62 in 2010 

total unit sales decreased 4 to 160 million units in 2010 from 166 million units in 2009 the declining unit sales volume in 2010 was attributable to a decline in automotivemobile units due to increased saturation in the segment and competing technologies partially offset by increasing volumes in the outdoorfitness marine and aviation segments 

automotivemobile segment revenue declined 19 in 2010 as the average selling price and volumes declined 11 and 9 respectively outdoorfitness segment revenue increased 19 on the strength of recent product introductions that expand the addressable market and ongoing global penetration marine revenues increased 12 due to product introductions slight industry recovery and market share gains aviation revenues increased 7 as the company delivered into additional cockpits and the retrofit business began to recover 

the company anticipates ongoing revenue declines in 2011 driven by the automotivemobile segment with partially offsetting growth in the outdoorfitness aviation and marine segments in general management believes that continuous innovation and the introduction of new products are essential for future revenue growth 

cost of goods sold 

 

cost of goods sold decreased 11 in 2010 when compared to the yearago period which was generally consistent with the change in revenue the absolute dollar decrease occurred in automotivemobile and was partially offset by cost of goods increases in outdoorfitness marine and aviation cost of goods sold in 2010 was positively impacted by 160 basis points due to a 428 million warranty adjustment related to refinement in the estimated warranty reserve this adjustment impacted all segments with automotivemobile outdoorfitness and marine having the largest benefits cost per unit declined in all segments driving stable to improving margins in outdoorfitness marine and aviation 

management believes that cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales will be stable in 2011 given current component pricing 

 

  

  

 

gross profit 

 

 

gross profit dollars in 2010 decreased 7 while gross profit margin percentage increased 110 basis points compared to 2009 gross profit margins were stable to increasing in all segments excluding the automotivemobile segment when compared to 2009 

the automotivemobile segment gross profit margin percentage decrease of 160 basis points was driven by an 11 decrease in average selling price which was only partially offset by a decline in per unit costs including the warranty benefit gross profit dollars of the automotivemobile segment declined to 50 of total gross profit dollars from 60 in 2009 gross profit dollars for marine increased 18 compared to 2009 due to product mix shifting toward higher margin units gross profit dollars for outdoorfitness increased by 19 to 3645 million due to strong revenue growth in the segment 

management believes that total company gross margins will be stable in 2011 as growth occurs in segments with higher margin profiles offsetting continued margin pressure in the automotivemobile segment due to price declines 

advertising expenses 

 

 

advertising expense decreased 7 in absolute dollars and was flat as a percentage of revenues when compared to 2009 as a percent of revenues advertising expenses were 5 in both 2010 and 2009 the absolute dollar decrease occurred primarily in the automotivemobile segment due to reduced cooperative advertising paid to our retail partners partially offset by mobile handset specific advertising further offsetting the decline was increased advertising for outdoorfitness where we continue to invest for growth 

 

management expects to maintain advertising as a percentage of sales constant in 2011 

selling general and administrative expenses 

 

 

  

  

selling general and administrative expense increased in both absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues compared to 2009 as a percent of revenues selling general and administrative expenses increased from 9 of revenues in 2009 to 11 of revenues in 2010 the expense increase was primarily driven by legal costs fees associated with the swiss redomestication and growth in product support and information technology to support our growing installed base of users aviation costs declined yearoveryear due to a 2009 bad debt accrual driven by cash collection risks associated with several of our customers that did not reoccur in 2010 

management expects selling general and administrative expenses to decline in absolute dollars but to increase as a percentage of sales in 2011 as revenue declines outpace cost reductions 

research and development expense 

 

 

research and development expense increased 16 due to ongoing development activities for new products including the mobile handset initiative which has now been cancelled and the addition of over 350 new engineering personnel to our staff during the period in absolute dollars research and development costs increased 389 million primarily in the automobile segment when compared with the yearago period and increased 220 basis points as a percent of revenue 

management believes that one of the key strategic initiatives for future growth and success of garmin is continuous innovation development and introduction of new products management expects that its research and development expenses will be stable during fiscal 2011 on an absolute dollar basis in order to deliver innovative new products and technologies 

operating income 

 

 

operating income decreased 300 basis points as a percent of revenue and 19 in absolute dollars when compared to the yearago period as gross margin percentage improvements and reduced advertising expense were more than offset by declining revenues and increased selling general and administrative and research and development expenses 

the automotivemobile operating margin declined from 22 in 2009 to 15 in 2010 due to a 160 basis point decline in gross margins and selling general and administrative and research and development expense increases during a period of declining revenues the aviation operating margin increased from 24 in 2009 to 28 in 2010 as gross margins improved 100 basis points 

 

  

  

 

other income expense 

 

 

 

other income expense principally consists of interest income and foreign currency exchange gains and losses other income expense was lower in fiscal 2010 relative to fiscal 2009 with the majority of this difference caused by a large foreign currency loss in 2010 interest income for fiscal 2010 increased due to increasing cash and marketable securities balances during the year partially offset by decreasing interest rates 

foreign currency gains and losses for the company are primarily tied to movements by the taiwan dollar the euro and the british pound sterling due to the relative size of entities using other currencies movements are not expected to have a material impact on the company’s financial statements the euro is the functional currency of all subsidiaries excluding those shown below as subsidiaries have grown currency moves generated material gains and losses additionally eurobased intercompany transactions in garmin ltd can also generate currency gains and losses 

the 884 million currency loss in 2010 was due to the strengthening of the us dollar compared to the euro and the british pound sterling as well as the weakening of the us dollar compared to the taiwan dollar during 2010 the us dollar strengthened 88 and 33 compared to the euro and the british pound sterling respectively resulting in a loss of 510 million a loss of 387 million resulted due to the us dollar weakening 59 against the taiwan dollar the movements of the taiwan dollar and eurobritish pound sterling have offsetting impacts due to the use of the taiwan dollar for manufacturing costs and cash held in nonfunctional currency while the euro and british pound sterling transactions relate to revenue the remaining net currency gain of 13 million related to other currencies and timing of transactions 

the 60 million currency loss in 2009 was due to the weakening of the us dollar compared to the euro the british pound sterling and the taiwan dollar during 2009 the us dollar weakened 24 and 83 compared to the euro and the british pound sterling respectively resulting in a gain of 58 million a loss of 161 million resulted due to the us dollar weakening 23 against the taiwan dollar the remaining net currency gain of 43 million related to other currencies and timing of transactions 

income tax provision 

our earnings before taxes fell 29 when compared to 2009 and our income tax expense decreased by 1120 million to 73 million for fiscal year 2010 from 1047 million for fiscal year 2009 the significant decline in income tax expense was due to the impact of onetime items booked in 2010 the onetime items of 987 million include release of uncertain tax position reserves from 2006 to 2008 related to our settlement with the irs in the us partially offset by the amount of the settlement for the 2007 tax year in the us and taiwan surtax expense due to the release of reserves without onetime items we would have reported an effective tax rate of 158 for 2010 compared to 129 for 2009 the increase in the adjusted effective tax rate as compared to 2009 is largely due to an unfavorable mix of income among taxing jurisdictions 

net income 

as a result of the various factors noted above net income decreased 17 to 5846 million for fiscal year 2010 compared to 7040 million for fiscal year 2009 

  

  

 

comparison of 52weeks ended december 26 2009 and december 27 2008 

net sales 

 

net sales decreased 16 in 2009 when compared to the yearago period the decrease occurred across all segments except outdoorfitness with the greatest decreases in the automotivemobile and aviation segments automotivemobile revenue was the largest portion of our revenue mix but declined from 73 in 2008 to 70 in 2009 

total unit sales decreased 2 to 166 million in 2009 from 169 million in 2008 the lower unit sales volume was attributable to declining volumes across all segments excluding outdoorfitness with the greatest percentage declines occurring in aviation and marine the lower volumes were driven primarily by the macroeconomic conditions and reduced inventory levels with many of our retail partners 

automotivemobile segment revenue declined 19 in 2009 as the average selling price declined 18 and volumes declined 2 average selling price declines continue to be attributable to the competitive environment in which our automotivemobile products compete the aviation and marine segments declined 24 and 13 respectively in 2009 as both industries experienced significant slowdowns associated with the macroeconomic conditions outdoorfitness segment revenue increased 10 due to new product introductions including the dakota™ series the forerunner® 405cx the forerunner® 310xt and edge® 500 and increasing global penetration of the fitness category all segments showed improving trends in the second half of 2009 as the macroeconomic conditions improved 

cost of goods sold 

 

cost of goods sold decreased 23 in 2009 when compared to 2008 due primarily to the 16 decline in revenue in addition cost per unit declined in all segments driving cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenue lower due to material cost reductions this savings was partially offset by inventory reserves associated with the mobile handset initiatives 

gross profit 

 

 

  

  

 

the decrease in gross profit dollars was primarily attributable to the automotivemobile and aviation segments where the effects of revenue declines were partially offset by the improved gross margins earned gross profit margin percentage for the company overall increased 450 basis points as margins expanded in all segments 

the automotivemobile segment gross profit margin percentage increase of 350 basis points was driven by material costs reductions partially offset by inventory reserves associated with the mobile handset initiative and price declines outdoorfitness gross margin increased principally due to a newer suite of higher margin products gross profit margin percentage for marine and aviation increased compared to 2008 due to increased average selling price and decreases in per unit costs driven by product mix and material cost reductions 

 

advertising expenses 

 

 

advertising expense decreased both as a percentage of sales and in absolute dollars when compared to 2008 as a percent of sales advertising expenses declined to 5 in 2009 compared to 60 in 2008 the decrease was a result of actions taken by the company to reduce costs as the macroeconomic conditions impacted sales across our segments and around the world combined with lower cooperative advertising which is tied to net sales levels 

selling general and administrative expenses 

 

 

selling general and administrative expense decreased 5 in 2009 while it increased as a percentage of sales compared to 2008 as costs throughout the company were reduced but not as rapidly as the revenue declines the decline in costs was primarily related to a reduction in bad debt expense due to specific reserves recorded in 2008 as a result of vendor bankruptcies offset by increased costs for product support and information technology the increased expense for the outdoorfitness segment and the decreased expense for the automotivemobile segment were driven by the allocation of costs based on revenues as outdoorfitness revenues have increased as a percentage of revenues additional selling general and administrative expenses are shifted to the segment as a percent of sales selling general and administrative expenses increased from 8 in 2008 to 9 of sales in 2009 as revenues declined 

research and development expense 

 

 

  

  

 

the increase in research and development expense dollars was due to ongoing development activities for new products including the mobile handset initiative the addition of 230 new engineering personnel to our staff during the period and an increase in engineering program costs in 2009 as a result of our continued emphasis on product innovation 

operating income 

 

operating income increased 200 basis points as a percent of revenue but decreased 9 in absolute dollars when compared to the yearago period as gross margin percentage improvements and reduced advertising expense were more than offset by declining revenues and increased research and development expenses 

other income expense 

 

other income expense principally consists of interest income and foreign currency exchange gains and losses other income expense was lower in fiscal 2009 relative to fiscal 2008 with the majority of this difference caused by a large gain on sale of equity securities in 2008 interest income for fiscal 2009 decreased due to lower interest rates partially offset by higher cash and marketable securities balances 

the 60 million currency loss in 2009 was due to the weakening of the us dollar compared to the euro the british pound sterling and the taiwan dollar during 2009 the us dollar weakened 24 and 83 compared to the euro and the british pound sterling respectively resulting in a gain of 58 million a loss of 161 million resulted due to the us dollar weakening 23 against the taiwan dollar the relative weakness of the taiwan dollar and eurobritish pound sterling have offsetting impacts due to the use of the taiwan dollar for manufacturing costs while the euro and british pound sterling transactions relate to revenue the remaining net currency gain of 43 million related to other currencies and timing of transactions 

the 353 million currency loss in 2008 was related to the strengthening of the us dollar offset by a gain associated with the sales and tender of our tele atlas nv shares during 2008 the taiwan dollar weakened 16 in comparison to the us dollar resulting in a 208 million gain the euro weakened 41 and the british pound sterling weakened 261 relative to the us dollar in 2008 which resulted in a 773 million loss offsetting this net loss was a realized gain of 215 million due to the strengthening of the euro between the date of purchase of the tele atlas nv shares in october 2007 to the dates of tender in february march and june 2008 other net currency losses and the timing of transactions created the remaining loss of 03 million 

gain on sale of equity of securities of 509 million in 2008 was primarily generated from the sale of our equity interest in tele atlas nv which we acquired in 2007 in connection with our announced intent to make a cash offer for all outstanding shares which was subsequently abandoned 

  

  

 

income tax provision 

our fiscal 2009 earnings before taxes fell 12 when compared to 2008 while our income tax expense decreased 42 income taxes fell 768 million to 1047 million for fiscal year 2009 from 1815 million for fiscal year 2008 due to a lower effective tax rate and the reduced earnings before taxes the effective tax rate was 129 for fiscal 2009 compared to 199 for fiscal 2008 the decrease in tax rate is due to the favorable mix of taxable income among the tax jurisdictions in which the company operates and the release of income tax reserves for which the statute of limitations has expired 

net income 

as a result of the various factors noted above net income decreased 4 to 7040 million for fiscal year 2009 compared to 7328 million for fiscal year 2008 

liquidity and capital resources 

net cash generated by operations was 7706 million 10945 million and 8622 million for fiscal years 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively primary drivers of the cash generation in 2010 included 5846 million of net income with noncash adjustments for depreciationamortization of 947 million foreign currency unrealized losses of 628 million stock compensation expense of 403 million 1297 million related to decreased accounts receivable as sales levels have declined and 1313 million of sales for which cash was received but revenue was deferred as required by our revenue recognition policies this cash generation was partially offset by uses of cash including a 1445 million reduction in other current and noncurrent liabilities related primarily to the timing of royalty payments and the 1464 million reversal of tax reserves associated with both release of uncertain tax position reserves from 2006 to 2008 related to our settlement with the irs in the us and expiration of statute of limitations a 814 million reduction in accounts payable primarily in our taiwan manufacturing operations due to timing of payments and a 771 million increase in inventories following a low inventory level exiting 2009 the decline in cash flow from operations over 2009 levels was due to reduced net income levels and the effect of the non cash income tax benefit realized from reduced tax reserves we expect to generate cash flow from operations in 2011 with ongoing net income as well as working capital gains through reduced accounts receivable and inventory levels as sales decline 

 

cash flow used in investing activities was 729 million 5479 million and 563 million for fiscal 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively cash flow used in investing activities principally relates to the net redemption of or investment in fixed income securities capital expenditures and acquisitions capital expenditures in 2010 totaled 322 million and related to business operations and maintenance activities this has declined significantly from 2008 spending levels due to the completion of production and warehouse facility expansions we have budgeted approximately 50 million of capital expenditures during fiscal 2011 to include normal ongoing capital expenditures and maintenance activities in 2010 and 2009 net investment in fixed income securities of our onhand cash was 255 million and 4910 million respectively as we invested excess cash in 2008 the net sale of fixed income securities was primarily related to 2393 million of cash generated from the tender of our shares of tele atlas nv it is management’s goal to invest the onhand cash consistent with garmin’s investment policy which has been approved by the board of directors the investment policy’s primary purpose is to preserve capital maintain an acceptable degree of liquidity and maximize yield within the constraint of low credit risk garmin’s average interest rate returns on cash and investments during fiscal 2010 2009 and 2008 were approximately 13 17 and 34 respectively in 2010 cash flow used in investing activities also included the acquisition of metrigear inc in 2008 cash flow used in investing for acquisitions related to the purchase of european distributors 

net cash used by financing activities in fiscal 2010 was 5108 million resulting from the use of 2989 million for payment of our declared dividend and 2259 million for stock repurchased under our stock repurchase plan partially offset by 140 million from the issuance of common stock related to our company stock option plan and stock based compensation tax benefits the 2010 dividend paid was significantly higher than prior years as the dividend was increased to 150 per share stock repurchases are made at the discretion of management under repurchase programs approved by the board of directors as business and market conditions warrant in 2010 2009 and 2008 the company repurchased 74 million shares 07 million shares and 171 million shares respectively 

  

  

 

we currently use cash flow from operations to fund our capital expenditures to support our working capital requirements to pay dividends and to repurchase shares we expect that future cash requirements will principally be for capital expenditures working capital repurchase of shares payment of dividends declared and the funding of strategic acquisitions 

 

we believe that our existing cash balances and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our projected capital expenditures working capital and other cash requirements at least through the end of fiscal 2011 

  

contractual obligations and commercial commitments 

future commitments of garmin as of december 25 2010 aggregated by type of contractual obligation are 

 

operating leases describes lease obligations associated with garmin facilities located in the us taiwan europe and canada 

we may be required to make significant cash outlays related to unrecognized tax benefits however due to the uncertainty of the timing of future cash flows associated with our unrecognized tax benefits we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement if any with the respective taxing authorities accordingly unrecognized tax benefits of 1536 million as of december 25 2010 have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above for further information related to unrecognized tax benefits see note 2 “income taxes” to the consolidated financial statements included in this report 

 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we do not have any offbalance sheet arrangements 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market sensitivity 

 

we have market risk primarily in connection with the pricing of our products and services and the purchase of raw materials product pricing and raw materials costs are both significantly influenced by semiconductor market conditions historically during cyclical industry downturns we have been able to offset pricing declines for our products through a combination of improved product mix and success in obtaining price reductions in raw materials costs 

 

  

  

 

inflation 

 

we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our business financial condition or results of operations if our costs were to become subject to significant inflationary pressures we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs through price increases our inability or failure to do so could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

the operation of garmin’s subsidiaries in international markets results in exposure to movements in currency exchange rates we have experienced significant foreign currency gains and losses due to the strengthening and weakening of the us dollar the potential of volatile foreign exchange rate fluctuations in the future could have a significant effect on our results of operations 

 

the currencies that create a majority of the company’s exchange rate exposure are the taiwan dollar euro and british pound sterling garmin corporation headquartered in sijhih taiwan uses the local currency as the functional currency the company translates all assets and liabilities at yearend exchange rates and income and expense accounts at average rates during the year in order to minimize the effect of the currency exchange fluctuations on our net assets we have elected to retain most of our taiwan subsidiary’s cash and investments in marketable securities denominated in us dollars 

 

all european subsidiaries excluding garmin europe ltd garmin danmark garmin sweden garmin polska and garmin norge use the euro as the functional currency  the functional currency of our largest european subsidiary garmin europe ltd remains the us dollar and as some transactions occurred in british pounds sterling or euros foreign currency gains or losses have been realized historically related to the movements of those currencies relative to the us dollar the company believes that gains and losses will become more material in the future as our european presence grows in 2010 the us dollar strengthened 88 relative to the euro and 33 relative to the british pound sterling these currency moves resulted in a foreign currency loss of 510 million in garmin ltd and our european subsidiaries a loss of 387 million resulted due to the us dollar weakening 59 against the taiwan dollar the net result of these currency moves combined with other gains of 13 million and the timing of transactions during the year was a net loss of 884 million for the company and a cumulative translation adjustment of 617 million at the end of fiscal 2010 

interest rate risk 

we have no outstanding longterm debt as of december 25 2010 we therefore have no meaningful debtrelated interest rate risk 

we are exposed to interest rate risk in connection with our investments in marketable securities as interest rates change the unrealized gains and losses associated with those securities will fluctuate accordingly a hypothetical change of 10 in interest rates would not have a material effect on such unrealized gains or losses at december 25 2010 cumulative unrealized losses on those securities were 46 million

company overview 

garmin is a leading worldwide provider of navigation communication and information devices and applications most of which are enabled by global positioning system “gps” technology garmin designs develops manufactures and markets a diverse family of handheld portable and fixedmount gpsenabled products and other navigation communications and information products for the automotivemobile outdoorfitness marine and general aviation markets 

 

 

overview of the global positioning system 

the global positioning system is a worldwide navigation system which enables the precise determination of geographic location using established satellite technology the system consists of a constellation of orbiting satellites the satellites and their ground control and monitoring stations are maintained and operated by the united states department of defense which maintains an ongoing satellite replenishment program to ensure continuous global system coverage access to the system is provided free of charge by the us government 

prior to may 2000 the us department of defense intentionally degraded the accuracy of civilian gps signals in a process known as selective availability ‘‘sa’’ for national security purposes sa variably degraded gps position accuracy to a radius of 100 meters on may 2 2000 the us department of defense discontinued sa in a presidential policy statement issued in december 2004 the bush administration indicated that the us does not intend to implement sa again and is committed to preventing hostile use of gps through regional denial of service minimizing the impact to peaceful users with sa removed a gps receiver can calculate its position to an accuracy of approximately 10 meters or less enhancing the utility of gps for most applications 

the accuracy and utility of gps can be enhanced through augmentation techniques which compute any remaining errors in the signal and broadcast these corrections to a gps device the federal aviation administration “faa” has developed a wide area augmentation system ‘‘waas’’ comprising ground reference stations and additional satellites that improve the accuracy of gps positioning available in the united states and portions of canada and mexico to approximately 3 meters waas supports the use of gps as the primary means of enroute terminal and approach navigation for aviation in the united states the increased accuracy offered by waas also enhances the utility of waasenabled gps receivers for consumer applications the faa announced on july 11 2003 that the waas system had achieved initial operating capability and that the system was available for instrument flight use with appropriately certified avionics equipment since that time the faa has installed additional ground reference stations and has launched additional waas satellites

competition 

the market for navigation communications and information products is highly competitive garmin believes the principal competitive factors impacting the market for its products are design functionality quality and reliability customer service brand price timetomarket and availability garmin believes that it generally competes favorably in each of these areas 

garmin believes that its principal competitors for portable automotive products are tomtom nv and mitac digital corporation “mitac” which distributes products under the brand names of magellan mio and navman and navigon ag garmin believes that its principal competitors for outdoor product lines are magellan a subsidiary of mitac lowrance electronics inc a subsidiary of navico “lowrance” and delorme and that its principal competitors for fitness products are nike inc polar electro oy suunto oy and timex corp for marine chartplotter products garmin believes that its principal competitors are raymarine ltd “raymarine” furuno electronic company “furuno” and simrad and lowrance subsidiaries of navico for garmin’s fishfinderdepth sounder product lines garmin believes that its principal competitors are lowrance raymarine the hummingbird division of johnson outdoors inc and furuno for garmin’s general aviation product lines garmin considers its principal competitors to be honeywell inc avidyne corporation l3 avionics systems rockwell collins inc universal avionics systems corporation chelton flight systems aspen avionics and free flight systems for panelmount gps and display units for garmin’s family radio service and general mobile radio service product line garmin believes that its principal competitors are motorola inc “motorola” cobra electronics corporation and midland radio corporation garmin believes that its principal competitors for smartphones are apple inc htc corporation nokia oyj samsung corporation sony ericsson mobile communications ab google inc motorola lg electronics palm inc and research in motion ltd 

research and development 

garmin’s product innovations are driven by its strong emphasis on research and development and the close partnership between garmin’s engineering and manufacturing teams garmin’s products are created by its engineering and development staff which numbered 1969 people worldwide as of december 26 2009 garmin’s manufacturing staff includes manufacturing process engineers who work closely with garmin’s design engineers to ensure manufacturability and manufacturing cost control for its products garmin’s development staff includes industrial designers as well as software engineers electrical engineers mechanical engineers and cartographic engineers garmin believes the industrial design of its products has played an important role in garmin’s success once a development project is initiated and approved a multidisciplinary team is created to design the product and transition it into manufacturing 

below is a table of garmin’s expenditures on research and development over the last three fiscal years 

 

manufacturing and operations 

garmin believes that one of its core competencies is its manufacturing capability at its shijr jhongli and linkou taiwan facilities its olathe kansas facility and its salem oregon facility garmin believes that its vertically integrated approach has provided it the following benefits with respect to all products other than the nüvifone products which are manufactured by one or more third parties as part of the garminasus strategic alliance and our accessory products which are also manufactured by one or more third parties 

  

  

reduced timetomarket utilizing concurrent engineering techniques garmin’s products are introduced to production at an early development stage and the feedback provided by manufacturing is incorporated into the design before mass production begins in this manner garmin attempts to reduce the time required to move a product from its design phase to mass production deliveries with improved quality and yields 

design and process optimization garmin uses its manufacturing resources to rapidly prototype design concepts products and processes in order to achieve higher efficiency lower cost and better value for customers garmin’s ability to fully explore product design and manufacturing process concepts has enabled it to optimize its designs to minimize size and weight in gps devices that are functional waterproof and rugged 

logistical agility operating its own manufacturing facilities helps garmin minimize problems such as component shortages and long component lead times which are common in the electronics industry many products can be reengineered to bypass component shortages or reduce cost and the new designs can be delivered to market quickly garmin reacts rapidly to changes in market demand by striving to maintain a safety stock of longlead components and by rescheduling components from one product line to another 

garmin’s design manufacturing distribution and servicing processes in our us taiwan and uk facilities are certified to iso 9001 an international quality standard developed by the international organization for standardization garmin’s taiwan manufacturing facilities have also achieved ts 16949 certification a quality standard for automotive suppliers in addition garmin’s aviation operations have achieved certification to as9100 the quality standard for the aviation industry 

garmin europe ltd and garmin corporation have also achieved certification of their environmental management systems to the iso14001 standard this certification recognizes that garmin’s uk and taiwan subsidiaries have systems and processes in place to minimize or prevent harmful effects on the environment and to strive continually to improve its environmental performance 

materials 

although most components essential to the company’s business are generally available from multiple sources certain key components including but not limited to microprocessors certain liquid crystal displays “lcds” and certain applicationspecific integrated circuits “asics” are currently obtained by the company from single or limited sources which subjects the company to supply and pricing risks many of these and other key components that are available from multiple sources including but not limited to nand flash memory dynamic random access memory “dram” gps chipsets and certain lcds are subject at times to industrywide shortages and commodity pricing fluctuations 

the company and other participants in the personal computer mobile communication and consumer electronics industries also compete for various components with other industries that have experienced increased demand for their products in addition the company uses some custom components that are not common to the rest of the personal computer mobile communication and consumer electronics industries and new products introduced by the company often utilize custom components available from only one source until the company has evaluated whether there is a need for and subsequently qualifies additional suppliers when a component or product uses new technologies initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields have matured or manufacturing capacity has increased if the company’s supply of a key singlesourced component for a new or existing product were delayed or constrained if such components were available only at significantly higher prices or if a key manufacturing vendor delayed shipments of completed products to the company the company’s financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected the company’s business and financial performance could also be adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the original source or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source continued availability of these components at acceptable prices or at all may be affected if those suppliers decided to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the company’s requirements 

  

  

seasonality 

our sales are subject to significant seasonal fluctuation sales of our consumer products are generally significantly higher in the fourth quarter due to increased demand for automotivemobile products during the holiday buying season and to a lesser extent the second quarter due to increased demand during the spring and summer marine season and the father’s daygraduation buying season sales of consumer products are also influenced by the timing of the release of new products our aviation products do not experience much seasonal variation but are more influenced by the timing of the release of new products when the initial demand is typically the strongest 

backlog 

our sales are generally of a consumer nature and there is a relatively short cycle between order and shipment therefore we believe that backlog information is not material to the understanding of our business we typically ship most orders within 72 hours of receipt 

intellectual property 

our success and ability to compete is dependent in part on our proprietary technology we rely on a combination of patent copyright trademark and trade secret laws as well as confidentiality agreements to establish and protect our proprietary rights in addition garmin often relies on licenses of intellectual property for use in its business for example garmin obtains licenses for digital cartography technology for use in our products from various sources 

as of january 21 2010 garmin’s worldwide ip portfolio includes over 400 patents and 250 trademark registrations garmin was selected as a constituent of the 2009 ocean tomo® 300 patent index and the 2009 wall street journal® electronic  instruments patent scorecard both of which are indices that recognize companies with high intellectual property value we believe that our continued success depends on the intellectual skills of our employees and their ability to continue to innovate garmin will continue to file and prosecute patent applications when appropriate to attempt to protect garmin’s rights in its proprietary technologies 

there is no assurance that our current patents or patents which we may later acquire may successfully withstand any challenge in whole or in part it is also possible that any patent issued to us may not provide us with any competitive advantages or that the patents of others will preclude us from manufacturing and marketing certain products despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights to protect our trade secrets to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others or to defend against claims of infringement or invalidity 

  

  

regulations 

the telecommunications industry is highly regulated and the regulatory environment in which garmin operates is subject to change in accordance with federal communications commission “fcc” rules and regulations wireless transceiver and cellular handset products are required to be certified by the fcc and comparable authorities in foreign countries where they are sold garmin’s products sold in europe are required to comply with relevant directives of the european commission a delay in receiving required certifications for new products or enhancements to garmin’s products or losing certification for garmin’s existing products could adversely affect our business in addition aviation products that are intended for installation in “type certificated aircraft” are required to be certified by the faa its european counterpart the european aviation safety agency and other comparable organizations before they can be used in an aircraft 

because garmin corporation one of the company’s principal subsidiaries is located in taiwan foreign exchange control laws and regulations of taiwan with respect to remittances into and out of taiwan may have an impact on garmin’s operations the taiwan foreign exchange control statute and regulations thereunder provide that all foreign exchange transactions must be executed by banks designated to handle such business by the ministry of finance of taiwan and by the central bank of the republic of china taiwan also referred to as the cbc current regulations favor traderelated foreign exchange transactions consequently foreign currency earned from exports of merchandise and services may now be retained and used freely by exporters while all foreign currency needed for the import of merchandise and services may be purchased freely from the designated foreign exchange banks aside from traderelated foreign exchange transactions taiwan companies and residents may without foreign exchange approval remit outside and into taiwan foreign currencies of up to 50 million and 5 million respectively or their equivalent each calendar year currency conversions within the limits are processed by the designated banks and do not have to be reviewed and approved by the cbc the above limits apply to remittances involving a conversion between new taiwan dollars and us dollars or other foreign currencies the cbc typically approves foreign exchange in excess of the limits if a party applies with the cbc for review and presents legitimate business reasons justifying the currency conversion a requirement is also imposed on all enterprises to register all medium and longterm foreign debt with the cbc 

environmental matters 

the european union “eu” enacted the restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment directive rohs directive and the waste electrical and electronic equipment directive “weee directive” the rohs directive requires eu member states to enact laws prohibiting the use of certain substances including lead mercury cadmium and hexavalent chromium in certain electronic products put on the market after july 1 2006 the weee directive requires eu member states to enact laws that were to go into effect by august 13 2005 regulating the collection recovery and recycling of waste from certain electronic products we modified the design of our products and our manufacturing processes and are participating in the collection and recycling programs in order to comply with such laws and regulations the eu is reviewing the rohs directive and an amended version – “rohs ii” – is expected to be adopted in the spring of 2010 while the basic objective should remain the same it is expected that rohs ii will provide clearer directives and complement other eu legislation by using similar methodologies 

the eu has also enacted the registration evaluation authorization and restriction of chemicals “reach” regulation reach requires manufacturers and importers of articles to register the substances contained in the articles if the substances are intended to be released under normal or reasonably foreseeable conditions of use because the substances contained in our products are not intended to be released under normal or reasonably foreseeable conditions of use we do not believe we or the importers of our products have an obligation under reach to register those substances it is possible however that garmin could participate in the reach regulations as necessary to support possible reach registration requirements of the recyclers of our products reach also imposes notification and restriction requirements on manufacturers and importers of articles if the articles contain “substances of very high concern” we have established a program in order to comply when and to the extent necessary in january 2010 the european chemicals agency echa formally added 14 chemicals to the reach candidate list of substances of very high concern svhc which brings the total number of chemicals on the svhc candidate list to 28 under the reach regulations producers and importers of a chemical on the candidate list whose quantities in the producedimported articles are above 1 metric ton in total per year and in a concentration that exceeds 01 weight by weight ww will be required to notify the european chemical agency with information pertaining to its use by june 1 2011 garmin is currently gathering information from its suppliers as to whether any of the chemicals listed on the january 2010 svhc list are contained in any articles purchased from such suppliers garmin is continuing an ongoing effort to obtain information necessary for garmin to evaluate any possible notification responsibilities 

  

  

acdc adapters included as an accessory with certain garmin products or sold as an option for battery charging of many portable garmin products will require submissions of energyuse profiles in accordance with the eu eup energy using products directive garmin is modifying the design and energyuse profiles of our adapters in order to comply with applicable laws and regulations additionally the us department of energy has promulgated a regulation pertaining to external power supplies and compliance with the energy efficiency standards that were established under the energy independence and security act of 2007 we will be addressing these requirements as necessary 

garmin products may also become subject to further energy efficiency requirements if and when required under us federal climate change legislation 

in june 2009 the california air resources board adopted proposed regulations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions which would begin phasing in starting with 2012 modelyear vehicles that would require vehicles sold in california to have solar reflective window glazing that may interfere with the reception of gps satellite signals by portable navigation devices 

the people’s republic of china has enacted legislation which is widely known as “china rohs” the first phase of china rohs took effect on march 1 2007 and requires the disclosure and marking of certain substances including lead mercury cadmium and hexavalent chromium in certain electronic products we have established a program in order to comply with the first phase of china rohs 

other states and countries have promulgated or proposed legislation similar to the rohs directive andor the weee directive the need for and cost of our compliance with such legislation cannot yet be fully determined but the cost could be substantial 

several states have enacted laws pertaining to the reduction of mercury in products and the labeling of mercurycontaining products including the member states of the interstate mercury education and reduction clearinghouse imerc some of these laws including those in connecticut new york vermont and louisiana are applicable to certain of garmin’s gps products we have established an ongoing compliance program to ensure that we are fulfilling the notice and labeling requirements set forth in the relevant mercury legislation 

garmin has implemented multiple environmental management system “ems” policies in accordance with the international organization for standardization iso 14001 standard for environmental health and safety management garmin’s ems policies set forth practices standards and procedures to ensure compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations at garmin’s kansas headquarters facility garmin’s european headquarters facility and garmin’s taiwan manufacturing facility 

regulatory and “green procurement” demands from our customers are also increasing particularly in the areas of restricted substance use and environmentallyfriendly design and manufacture initiatives the overall impacts of these customer requirements cannot yet be established garmin is committed to improving our products and processes to meet our customer needs 

  

  

employees 

as of december 31 2009 garmin had 8437 full and parttime employees worldwide of whom 2948 were in the united states 68 were in canada 4727 were in taiwan 623 were in europe and 71 were in other global locations except for some of garmin’s employees in brazil iceland and sweden none of garmin’s employees are represented by a labor union and none of garmins north american or taiwan employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement garmin considers its employee relations to be good 




 item 1a risk factors 

the risks described below are not the only ones facing our company additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also impair our business operations if any of the following risks occur our business financial condition or operating results could be materially adversely affected 

risks related to the company 

the demand for personal navigation devices pnds may be eroded by replacement technologies becoming available on mobile handsets and factoryinstalled systems in new autos 

we have experienced substantial growth in the automotivemobile segment which has resulted in gpsnavigation technologies being incorporated into competing devices such as mobile handsets and new automobiles through factoryinstalled systems mobile handsets are frequently gpsenabled and many companies are now offering navigation software for mobile devices the acceptance of this technology by consumers could slow our growth and further reduce margins navigation systems are also becoming more prevalent as optional equipment on new automobiles increased navigation penetration on new automobiles could slow our growth and further reduce margins 

our financial results are highly dependent on the automotivemobile segment which now represents approximately 70 of our revenues and may be maturing leading to lesser growth than we have experienced in the past 

  we have experienced substantial growth in the automotivemobile segment of our business in recent years as the products have become massmarket consumer electronics in both europe and north america this market growth may now be slowing as penetration rates increase and competing technologies emerge slowing growth along with the significant price reductions that have occurred during the past three years could result in lower revenues as margins have also declined in this segment slowing growth may also result in lower earnings per share 

economic conditions and uncertainty could adversely affect our revenue and margins 

our revenue and margins depend significantly on general economic conditions and the demand for products in the markets in which we compete the current economic weakness and constrained consumer and business spending has resulted in decreased revenue and may in the future result in decreased revenue and problems with our ability to manage inventory levels and collect customer receivables in addition financial difficulties experienced by our retailer and oem customers have resulted and could result in the future in significant bad debt writeoffs and additions to reserves in our receivables and could have an adverse affect on our results of operations 

  

  

gross margins for our products may fluctuate or erode 

gross margins on our automotivemobile products were declining prior to 2009 and are expected to decline in 2010 due to price reductions in the increasingly competitive market for personal navigation devices pnds that are not offset by material cost reductions in addition our overall gross margin may fluctuate from period to period due to a number of factors including product mix competition and unit volumes in particular the average selling prices of a specific product tend to decrease over that product’s life to offset such decreases we intend to rely primarily on component cost reduction obtaining yield improvements and corresponding cost reductions in the manufacture of existing products and on introducing new products that incorporate advanced features and therefore can be sold at higher average selling prices however there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain any such yield improvements or cost reductions or introduce any such new products in the future to the extent that such cost reductions and new product introductions do not occur in a timely manner or our products do not achieve market acceptance our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

changes in our united states federal income tax classification or in applicable tax law could result in adverse tax consequences to our shareholders 

we do not believe that we or any of our nonunited states subsidiaries are currently a ‘‘passive foreign investment company’’ for united states federal income tax purposes we do not expect to become a passive foreign investment company however because the passive foreign investment company determination is made annually based on whether the company’s income or assets meet certain thresholds as determined under united states federal tax principles which are based on facts and circumstances that may be beyond our control we cannot assure that we will not become a passive foreign investment company in the future if we are a passive foreign investment company in any year then any of our shareholders that is a united states person could be liable to pay tax on their pro rata share of our income plus an interest charge upon some distributions by us or when that shareholder sells our common shares at a gain further if we are classified as a passive foreign investment company in any year in which a united states person is a shareholder we generally will continue to be treated as a passive foreign investment company with respect to such shareholder in all succeeding years regardless of whether we continue to satisfy the income or asset tests mentioned above 

 

we do not believe that we or any of our nonunited states subsidiaries are currently a controlled foreign corporation cfc for united states federal income tax purposes we do not expect to become a cfc the cfc determination is made daily based on whether the united states shareholders own more than fifty percent of the voting power or value of the company only united states persons that own ten percent or more of the voting power of the company’s shares qualify as united states shareholders if the company were to be classified as a cfc for an uninterrupted thirty day period in any year the company’s shareholders that qualify as united states shareholders could be liable to pay us income tax at ordinary income tax rates on their prorata share of certain categories of the company’s income for the period in which the company is classified as a cfc as the company cannot control the ownership of the company’s stock nor can the company control which shareholders participate in the company’s stock buyback program ownership changes could result that create united states shareholders which increase the risk of garmin being treated as a cfc 

 

legislative proposals have been considered in the united states within the past year that could increase the united states tax burden of corporations with international operations and could broaden the circumstances under which foreign corporations could be considered resident in the united states our tax position could be adversely impacted by changes in united states or foreign tax laws tax treaties or tax regulations or the interpretation or enforcement thereof by any tax authority we cannot predict the outcome of any specific legislative proposals 

 

best buy is a significant customer representing over 10 of net sales accordingly our revenues and profitability will be adversely impacted if best buy’s business declines or if best buy is unable to pay us amounts owed timely 

best buy is our largest customer and accounted for 134 and 120 of our total net sales in 2009 and 2008 respectively if best buy’s business declines due to the economic conditions market share losses or other factors our revenues and profitability will be adversely impacted in addition if best buy’s liquidity erodes for any of the reasons discussed above or a tightening in the credit markets and they are unwilling or unable to pay us amounts owed timely our profitability will be adversely impacted 

  

  

if we are not successful in the continued development introduction or timely manufacture of new products demand for our products could decrease 

we expect that a significant portion of our future revenue will continue to be derived from sales of newly introduced products the market for our products is characterized by rapidly changing technology evolving industry standards and changes in customer needs if we fail to introduce new products or to modify or improve our existing products in response to changes in technology industry standards or customer needs our products could rapidly become less competitive or obsolete we must continue to make significant investments in research and development in order to continue to develop new products enhance existing products and achieve market acceptance for such products however there can be no assurance that development stage products will be successfully completed or if developed will achieve significant customer acceptance 

if we are unable to successfully develop and introduce competitive new products and enhance our existing products our future results of operations would be adversely affected our pursuit of necessary technology may require substantial time and expense we may need to license new technologies to respond to technological change these licenses may not be available to us on terms that we can accept or may materially change the gross profits that we are able to obtain on our products we may not succeed in adapting our products to new technologies as they emerge development and manufacturing schedules for technology products are difficult to predict and there can be no assurance that we will achieve timely initial customer shipments of new products the timely availability of these products in volume and their acceptance by customers are important to our future success from time to time we have experienced delays in shipping certain of our new products and any future delays whether due to product development delays manufacturing delays lack of market acceptance delays in regulatory approval or otherwise could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

if we are unable to compete effectively with existing or new competitors our resulting loss of competitive position could result in price reductions fewer customer orders reduced margins and loss of market share 

the markets for our products are highly competitive and we expect competition to increase in the future some of our competitors have significantly greater financial technical and marketing resources than we do these competitors may be able to respond more rapidly to new or emerging technologies or changes in customer requirements they may also be able to devote greater resources to the development promotion and sale of their products increased competition could result in price reductions fewer customer orders reduced margins and loss of market share our failure to compete successfully against current or future competitors could seriously harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

we rely on independent dealers and distributors to sell our products and disruption to these channels would harm our business 

because we sell a majority of our products to independent dealers and distributors we are subject to many risks including risks related to their inventory levels and support for our products in particular our dealers and distributors maintain significant levels of our products in their inventories if dealers and distributors attempt to reduce their levels of inventory or if they do not maintain sufficient levels to meet customer demand our sales could be negatively impacted 

many of our dealers and distributors also sell products offered by our competitors if our competitors offer our dealers and distributors more favorable terms those dealers and distributors may deemphasize or decline to carry our products in the future we may not be able to retain or attract a sufficient number of qualified dealers and distributors if we are unable to maintain successful relationships with dealers and distributors or to expand our distribution channels our business will suffer 

our quarterly operating results are subject to fluctuations and seasonality 

our operating results are difficult to predict our future quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly if such operating results decline the price of our stock would likely decline as we expand our operations our operating expenses particularly our advertising and research and development costs may increase as a percentage of our sales if revenues decrease and we are unable to reduce those costs rapidly our operating results would be negatively affected 

  

  

historically our revenues have been weaker in the first quarter of each fiscal year and have recently been lower than the preceding fourth quarter our devices are highly consumeroriented and consumer buying is traditionally lower in these quarters sales of certain of our marine and automotive   products tend to be higher in our second fiscal quarter due to increased consumer spending for such products during the recreational marine fishing and travel season sales of our automotivemobile products also have been higher in our fourth fiscal quarter due to increased consumer spending patterns on electronic devices during the holiday season   in addition we attempt to time our new product releases to coincide with relatively higher consumer spending in the second and fourth fiscal quarters which contributes to these seasonal variations 

our quarterly financial statements will reflect fluctuations in foreign currency translation 

the operation of garmin’s subsidiaries in international markets results in exposure to movements in currency exchange rates we have experienced significant foreign currency gains and losses due to the strengthening and weakening of the us dollar the potential of volatile foreign exchange rate fluctuations in the future could have a significant effect on our results of operations 

the currencies that create a majority of the company’s exchange rate exposure are the taiwan dollar euro and british pound sterling garmin corporation headquartered in shijr taiwan uses the local currency as the functional currency the company translates all assets and liabilities at yearend exchange rates and income and expense accounts at average rates during the year in order to minimize the effect of the currency exchange fluctuations on our net assets we have elected to retain most of our taiwan subsidiary’s cash and investments in marketable securities denominated in us dollars 

nonetheless us gaap requires the company at the end of each accounting period to translate into taiwan dollars all such us dollar denominated assets held by our taiwan subsidiary this translation is required because the taiwan dollar is the functional currency of the subsidiary this us gaapmandated translation will cause us to recognize gain or loss on our financial statements as the taiwan dollarus dollar exchange rate varies such gain or loss will create variations in our earnings per share because there is minimal cash impact caused by such exchange rate variations management will continue to focus on the company’s operating performance before the impact of the foreign currency translation 

if we do not correctly anticipate demand for our products we may not be able to secure sufficient quantities or costeffective production of our products or we could have costly excess production or inventories 

we have generally been able to increase production to meet this increasing demand however the demand for our products depends on many factors and will be difficult to forecast we expect that it will become more difficult to forecast demand as we introduce and support multiple products as competition in the market for our products intensifies and as the markets for some of our products mature to the mass market category significant unanticipated fluctuations in demand could cause the following problems in our operations 

 

 

  

  

 

we have benefited in the past from taiwan government tax incentives offered on certain high technology capital investments that may not always be available 

our effective tax rate is lower than the us federal statutory rate because we have benefited from incentives offered in taiwan related to our high technology investments in taiwan the loss of these tax benefits could have a significant effect on our financial results in the future 

we may experience unique economic and political risks associated with companies that operate in taiwan 

relations between taiwan and the people’s republic of china also referred to as the prc and other factors affecting the political or economic conditions of taiwan in the future could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations and the market price and the liquidity of our shares our principal manufacturing facilities where we manufacture all of our products except our panelmounted aviation products are located in taiwan 

taiwan has a unique international political status the prc asserts sovereignty over all of china including taiwan certain other islands and all of mainland china the prc government does not recognize the legitimacy of the taiwan government although significant economic and cultural relations have been established during recent years between taiwan and the prc the prc government has indicated that it may use military force to gain control over taiwan in certain circumstances such as the declaration of independence by taiwan relations between taiwan and the prc have on occasion adversely affected the market value of taiwanese companies and could negatively affect our operations in taiwan in the future 

our intellectual property rights are important to our operations and we could suffer loss if they infringe upon other’s rights or are infringed upon by others 

we rely on a combination of patents copyrights trademarks and trade secrets confidentiality provisions and licensing arrangements to establish and protect our proprietary rights to this end we hold rights to a number of patents and registered trademarks and regularly file applications to attempt to protect our rights in new technology and trademarks however there is no guarantee that our patent applications will become issued patents or that our trademark applications will become registered trademarks moreover even if approved our patents or trademarks may thereafter be successfully challenged by others or otherwise become invalidated for a variety of reasons thus any patents or trademarks we currently have or may later acquire may not provide us a significant competitive advantage 

third parties may claim that we are infringing their intellectual property rights such claims could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition from time to time we receive letters alleging infringement of patents trademarks or other intellectual property rights litigation concerning patents or other intellectual property is costly and time consuming we may seek licenses from such parties but they could refuse to grant us a license or demand commercially unreasonable terms we might not have sufficient resources to pay for the licenses such infringement claims could also cause us to incur substantial liabilities and to suspend or permanently cease the use of critical technologies or processes or the production or sale of major products 

  

  

we may become subject to significant product liability costs 

if our aviation products malfunction or contain errors or defects airplane collisions or crashes could occur resulting in property damage personal injury or death malfunctions or errors or defects in our marine navigational products could cause boats to run aground or cause other wreckage personal injury or death if our automotive or marine products contain defects or errors in the mapping supplied by thirdparty map providers or if our users do not heed our warnings about the proper use of these products collisions or accidents could occur resulting in property damage personal injury or death if any of these events occurs we could be subject to significant liability for personal injury and property damage and under certain circumstances could be subject to a judgment for punitive damages we maintain insurance against accidentrelated risks involving our products however there can be no assurance that such insurance would be sufficient to cover the cost of damages to others or that such insurance will continue to be available at commercially reasonable rates in addition insurance coverage generally will not cover awards of punitive damages and may not cover the cost of associated legal fees and defense costs which could result in lower margins if we are unable to maintain sufficient insurance to cover product liability costs or if our insurance coverage does not cover the award this could have a materially adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we depend on our suppliers some of which are the sole source for specific components and our production would be seriously harmed if these suppliers are not able to meet our demand and alternative sources are not available or if the costs of components rise 

we are dependent on third party suppliers for various components used in our current products some of the components that we procure from third party suppliers include semiconductors and electroluminescent panels liquid crystal displays memory chips batteries and microprocessors the cost quality and availability of components are essential to the successful production and sale of our products some components we use are from sole source suppliers certain applicationspecific integrated circuits incorporating our proprietary designs are manufactured for us by sole source suppliers alternative sources may not be currently available for these sole source components 

in the past we have experienced shortages of liquid crystal displays and other components in addition if there are shortages in supply of components the costs of such components may rise if suppliers are unable to meet our demand for components on a timely basis and if we are unable to obtain an alternative source or if the price of the alternative source is prohibitive or if the costs of components rise our ability to maintain timely and costeffective production of our products would be seriously harmed 

we depend on third party licensors for the digital map data contained in our automotivemobile products and our business andor gross margins could be harmed if we become unable to continue licensing such mapping data or if the royalty costs for such data rise 

we license digital mapping data for use in our products from various sources there are only a limited number of suppliers of mapping data for each geographical region the two largest digital map suppliers are navteq corporation and tele atlas nv navteq corporation is owned by nokia oyj and tele atlas nv is owned by tomtom nv nokia and tomtom are both competitors of garmin 

although we do not foresee difficulty in continuing to license data at favorable pricing due to the long term license extension signed between garmin and navteq in november 2007 extending our navteq license agreement through 2015 with an option to extend through 2019 if we are unable to continue licensing such mapping data and are unable to obtain an alternative source or if the nature of our relationships with navteq changes detrimentally our ability to supply mapping data for use in our products would be seriously harmed 

we may pursue strategic acquisitions investments strategic partnerships or other ventures and our business could be materially harmed if we fail to successfully identify complete and integrate such transactions 

we intend to evaluate acquisition opportunities and opportunities to make investments in complementary businesses technologies services or products or to enter into strategic partnerships with parties who can provide access to those assets additional product or services offerings additional distribution or marketing synergies or additional industry expertise we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition investment or strategic partnership candidates or if we do identify suitable candidates in the future we may not be able to complete those transactions on commercially favorable terms or at all 

  

  

any past or future acquisitions could also result in difficulties assimilating acquired employees including cultural differences with foreign acquisitions operations and products and diversion of capital and management’s attention away from other business issues and opportunities integration of acquired companies may result in problems related to integration of technology and inexperienced management teams in addition the key personnel of the acquired company may decide not to work for us we may not successfully integrate internal controls compliance under the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 and other corporate governance matters operations personnel or products related to acquisitions we have made in previous years or may make in the future if we fail to successfully integrate such transactions our business could be materially harmed 

we may have additional tax liabilities 

we are subject to income taxes in both the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes in the ordinary course of our business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain we are regularly under audit by tax authorities although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals the results of an audit or litigation could have a material effect on our income tax provision net income or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made 

our shareholders may face difficulties in protecting their interests because we are incorporated under cayman islands law 

our corporate affairs are governed by our memorandum and articles of association as amended and by the companies law 2009 revision and the common law of the cayman islands the rights of our shareholders and the fiduciary responsibilities of our directors under cayman islands law are not as clearly established as under statutes or judicial precedent in existence in jurisdictions in the united states therefore you may have more difficulty in protecting your interests in the face of actions by the management directors or our controlling shareholders than would shareholders of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction in the united states due to the comparatively less developed nature of cayman islands law in this area 

shareholders of cayman islands exempted companies such as garmin have no general rights under cayman islands law to inspect corporate records and accounts or to obtain copies of lists of shareholders of the company this may make it more difficult for you to obtain the information needed to establish any facts necessary for a shareholder motion or to solicit proxies from other shareholders in connection with a proxy contest 

subject to limited exceptions under cayman islands law a minority shareholder may not bring a derivative action against the board of directors our cayman islands counsel has advised that they are not aware of any reported class action or derivative action having been brought in a cayman islands court 

failure to obtain required certifications of our products on a timely basis could harm our business 

we have certain products especially in our aviation segment that are subject to governmental and similar certifications before they can be sold for example faa certification is required for all of our aviation products that are intended for installation in type certificated aircraft to the extent required certification is an expensive and timeconsuming process that requires significant focus and resources an inability to obtain or excessive delay in obtaining such certifications could have an adverse effect on our ability to introduce new products and for certain aviation oem products our customers’ ability to sell airplanes therefore such inabilities or delays could adversely affect our operating results   in addition we cannot assure you that our certified products will not be decertified any such decertification could have an adverse effect on our operating results 

  

  

our business may suffer if we are not able to hire and retain sufficient qualified personnel or if we lose our key personnel 

our future success depends partly on the continued contribution of our key executive engineering sales marketing manufacturing and administrative personnel we currently do not have employment agreements with any of our key executive officers we do not have key man life insurance on any of our key executive officers and do not currently intend to obtain such insurance the loss of the services of any of our senior level management or other key employees could harm our business recruiting and retaining the skilled personnel we require to maintain and grow our market position may be difficult for example in some recent years there has been a nationwide shortage of qualified electrical engineers and software engineers who are necessary for us to design and develop new products and therefore it has sometimes been challenging to recruit such personnel if we fail to hire and retain qualified employees we may not be able to maintain and expand our business 

there is uncertainty as to our shareholders’ ability to enforce certain foreign civil liabilities in the cayman islands and taiwan 

we are a cayman islands company and a substantial portion of our assets are located outside the united states particularly in taiwan as a result it may be difficult to effect service of process within the united states upon us in addition there is uncertainty as to whether the courts of the cayman islands or taiwan would recognize or enforce judgments of united states courts obtained against us predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the united states or any state thereof or be competent to hear original actions brought in the cayman islands or taiwan against us predicated upon the securities laws of the united states or any state thereof 

a shut down of us airspace or imposition of restrictions on general aviation would harm our business 

following the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks the faa ordered all aircraft operating in the us to be grounded for several days in addition to this shut down of us airspace the general aviation industry was further impacted by the additional restrictions implemented by the faa on those flights that fly utilizing visual flight rules vfr the faa restricted vfr flight inside 30 enhanced class b a 2025 mile radius around the 30 largest metropolitan areas in the usa airspace areas the aircraft owners and pilots association aopa estimated that these restrictions affected approximately 41800 general aviation aircraft based at 282 airports inside the 30 enhanced class b airspace areas the aopa estimates that approximately 90 of all general aviation flights are conducted vfr and that only 15 of general aviation pilots are current to fly utilizing instrument flight rules ifr 

the shutdown of us airspace following september 11 2001 caused reduced sales of our general aviation products and delays in the shipment of our products manufactured in our taiwan manufacturing facility to our distribution facility in olathe kansas thereby adversely affecting our ability to supply new and existing products to our dealers and distributors 

any future shut down of us airspace or imposition of restrictions on general aviation could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results 

many of our products rely on the global positioning system 

the global positioning system is a satellitebased navigation and positioning system consisting of a constellation of orbiting satellites the satellites and their ground control and monitoring stations are maintained and operated by the united states department of defense the department of defense does not currently charge users for access to the satellite signals these satellites and their ground support systems are complex electronic systems subject to electronic and mechanical failures and possible sabotage the satellites were originally designed to have lives of 75 years and are subject to damage by the hostile space environment in which they operate however of the current deployment of satellites in place some have been operating for more than 12 years 

  

  

if a significant number of satellites were to become inoperable unavailable or are not replaced it would impair the current utility of our global positioning system products and would have a material negative effect on our business in addition there can be no assurance that the us government will remain committed to the operation and maintenance of global positioning system satellites over a long period or that the policies of the us government that provide for the use of the global positioning system without charge and without accuracy degradation will remain unchanged because of the increasing commercial applications of the global positioning system other us government agencies may become involved in the administration or the regulation of the use of global positioning system signals however in a presidential policy statement issued in december 2004 the bush administration indicated that the us is committed to supporting and improving the global positioning system and will continue providing it free from direct user fees 

some of our products also use signals from systems that augment gps such as the wide area augmentation system waas waas is operated by the faa any curtailment of the operating capability of waas could result in decreased user capability for many of our aviation products thereby impacting our markets 

any of the foregoing factors could affect the willingness of buyers of our products to select global positioning systembased products instead of products based on competing technologies 

any reallocation of radio frequency spectrum could cause interference with the reception of global positioning system signals this interference could harm our business 

our global positioning system technology is dependent on the use of the standard positioning service sps provided by the us government’s global positioning system satellites the global positioning system operates in radio frequency bands that are globally allocated for radio navigation satellite services the assignment of spectrum is controlled by an international organization known as the international telecommunications union ‘‘itu’’ the federal communications commission ‘‘fcc’’ is responsible for the assignment of spectrum for nongovernment use in the united states in accordance with itu regulations any itu or fcc reallocation of radio frequency spectrum including frequency band segmentation or sharing of spectrum could cause interference with the reception of global positioning system signals and may materially and adversely affect the utility and reliability of our products which would in turn have a material adverse effect on our operating results in addition emissions from mobile satellite service and other equipment operating in adjacent frequency bands or inband may materially and adversely affect the utility and reliability of our products which could result in a material adverse effect on our operating results the fcc continually receives proposals for new technologies and services such as ultrawideband technologies which may seek to operate in or across the radio frequency bands currently used by the gps sps adverse decisions by the fcc that result in harmful interference to the delivery of the gps sps may materially and adversely affect the utility and reliability of our products which could result in a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition 

our business is subject to disruptions and uncertainties caused by war or terrorism 

acts of war or acts of terrorism especially any directed at the gps signals could have a material adverse impact on our business operating results and financial condition the threat of terrorism and war and heightened security and military response to this threat or any future acts of terrorism may cause a redeployment of the satellites used in gps or interruptions of the system to the extent that such interruptions have an effect on sales of our products this could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

we may be exposed to certain regulatory and financial risks related to climate change 

 

climate change is receiving increasing attention worldwide some scientists legislators and others attribute global warming to increased levels of greenhouse gases including carbon dioxide which has led to significant legislative and regulatory efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions 

  

  

there are a number of pending legislative and regulatory proposals to address greenhouse gas emissions for example in june 2009 the us house of representatives passed the american clean energy and security act that would phasein significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions if enacted into law the us senate is considering a different bill and it is uncertain whether when and in what form a federal mandatory carbon dioxide emissions reduction program may be adopted similarly certain countries have adopted the kyoto protocol these actions could increase costs associated with our operations including costs for components used in the manufacture of our products and freight costs 

  in june 2009 the california air resources board adopted proposed regulations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions which would begin phasing in starting with 2012 modelyear vehicles that would require vehicles sold in california to have solar reflective window glazing that may interfere with the reception of gps satellite signals by portable navigation devices 

 

because it is uncertain what laws and regulations will be enacted we cannot predict the potential impact of such laws and regulations on our future consolidated financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

risks relating to our shares 

 

the volatility of our stock price could adversely affect investment in our common shares 

the market price of our common shares has been and may continue to be highly volatile during 2009 the price of our common shares ranged from a low of 1517 to a high of 3958 a variety of factors could cause the price of our common shares to fluctuate perhaps substantially including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in addition in recent years the stock market in general and the markets for shares of technology companies in particular have experienced extreme price fluctuations which have often been unrelated to the operating performance of affected companies any such fluctuations in the future could adversely affect the market price of our common shares and the market price of our common shares may decline 

 

our officers and directors exert substantial influence over us 

as of january 25 2010 members and former members of our board of directors and our executive officers together with members of their families and entities that may be deemed affiliates of or related to such persons or entities beneficially owned approximately 433 of our outstanding common shares accordingly these shareholders may be able to determine the outcome of corporate actions requiring shareholder approval such as mergers and acquisitions this level of ownership may have a significant effect in delaying deferring or preventing a change in control of garmin and may adversely affect the voting and other rights of other holders of our common shares 

  

  

provisions in our shareholder rights plan and our charter documents might deter delay or prevent a third party from acquiring us and cayman islands corporate law may impede a takeover which could decrease the value of our shares 

our board of directors has the authority to issue up to 1000000 preferred shares and to determine the price rights preferences privileges and restrictions including voting rights of those shares without any further vote or action by the shareholders this could have an adverse impact on the market price of our common shares we have no present plans to issue any preferred shares but we may do so the rights of the holders of common shares may be subject to and adversely affected by the rights of the holders of any preferred shares that may be issued in the future in addition we have adopted a classified board of directors our shareholders are unable to remove any director or the entire board of directors without a super majority vote in addition a super majority vote is required to approve transactions with interested shareholders shareholders do not have the right to call a shareholders’ meeting we have adopted a shareholders’ rights plan which under certain circumstances would significantly impair the ability of third parties to acquire control of us without prior approval of our board of directors this shareholders’ rights plan and the provisions in our charter documents could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us even if doing so would benefit our shareholders 

the cayman islands have recently introduced provisions to the companies law 2009 revision to facilitate mergers and consolidations between cayman islands companies and noncayman islands companies these provisions contained within part xvi of the companies law 2009 revision are broadly similar to the merger provisions as provided for under delaware law 

there are however a number of important material differences that could impede a takeover first the thresholds for approval of the merger plan by shareholders are higher the thresholds are a a shareholder resolution by majority in number representing 75 in value of the shareholders voting together as one class or b if the shares to be issued to each shareholder in the consolidated or surviving company are to have the same rights and economic value as the shares held in the constituent company a special resolution of the shareholders being 75 of those present in person in person or by proxy and voting voting together as one class 

as it is would not be expected that the shares would have the same rights and economic value following a takeover by way of merger it is expected that the first test is the one which would commonly apply this threshold essentially has three requirements first a majority in number of the shareholders must approve secondly such majority must hold 75 in value of all the outstanding shares and thirdly the shareholders must vote together as one class 

secondly the consent of each holder of a fixed or floating security interest in essence a documented security interest as opposed to one arising by operation of law is required to be obtained unless the grand court of the cayman islands waives such requirement 

the merger provisions contained within part xvi of the companies law 2009 revision do contain shareholder appraisal rights similar to that as provided for under delaware law such rights are limited to a merger under part xvi and do apply to schemes of arrangement as discussed below 

  

  

the companies law 2009 revision also contains separate statutory provisions that provide for the merger reconstruction and amalgamation of companies which are commonly referred to in the cayman islands as a “scheme of arrangement” the procedural and legal requirements necessary to consummate these transactions are more rigorous and take longer to complete than the procedures typically required to consummate a merger in the united states under cayman islands law and practice a scheme of arrangement in relation to a solvent cayman islands exempted company must be approved at a shareholders’ meeting by a majority of each class of the company’s shareholders who are present and voting either in person or by proxy at such meeting the shares voted in favor of the scheme of arrangement must also represent at least 75 of the value of each relevant class of the company’s shareholders excluding the shares owned by the parties to the scheme of arrangement present and voting at the meeting the grand court of the cayman islands must also sanction the convening of these meetings and the terms of the amalgamation although there is no requirement to seek the consent of the creditors of the parties involved in the scheme of arrangement the grand court typically seeks to ensure that the creditors have consented to the transfer of their liabilities to the surviving entity or that the scheme of arrangement does not otherwise materially adversely affect the creditors’ interests furthermore the grand court will only approve a scheme of arrangement if it is satisfied that 

 

 

 

 

if the scheme of arrangement is approved the dissenting shareholder would have no rights comparable to appraisal rights which would otherwise ordinarily be available to dissenting shareholders of us corporations providing rights to receive payment in cash for the judicially determined value of the shares 

in addition if an offer by a third party to purchase shares in us has been approved by the holders of at least 90 of our outstanding shares not including such third party pursuant to an offer within a fourmonth period of making such an offer the purchaser may during the two months following expiration of the fourmonth period require the holders of the remaining shares to transfer their shares on the same terms on which the purchaser acquired the first 90 of our outstanding shares an objection can be made to the grand court of the cayman islands but this is unlikely to succeed unless there is evidence of fraud bad faith collusion or inequitable treatment of the shareholders

overview 

 

we are a leading worldwide provider of navigation communications and information devices most of which are enabled by global positioning system or gps technology we operate in four business segments which serve the marine outdoorfitness automotivemobile and aviation markets our segments offer products through our network of subsidiary distributors and independent dealers and distributors however the nature of products and types of customers for the four segments can vary significantly as such the segments are managed separately our portable gps receivers and accessories for marine recreationfitness and automotivemobile segments are sold primarily to retail outlets our aviation products are portable and panelmount avionics for visual flight rules and instrument flight rules navigation and are sold primarily to retail outlets and certain aircraft manufacturers 

since our first products were delivered in 1991 we have generated positive income from operations each year and have funded our growth from these profits our sales have increased at a compounded annual growth rate of 30 since 2005 and our net income has increased at a compounded annual growth rate of 23 since 2005 the vast majority of this growth has been organic only a very small amount of new revenue occurred as a result of the acquisition of motionbased technologies llc in 2005 dynastream innovations inc in 2006 digital cyclone inc and the assets of nautamatic marine systems inc in 2007 and ten european distributors in 2007 and 2008 these acquisitions had no significant impact on net income for those years 

since our principal locations are in the united states taiwan and the uk we experience some foreign currency fluctuations in our operating results while the us dollar remains the functional currency of garmin europe ltd the functional currency of all other european operations excluding garmin danmark and garmin sweden is the euro effective july 2007 and the functional currency of garmin corporation headquartered in taiwan is the taiwan dollar approximately 79 of sales by our european subsidiaries are now denominated in british pounds sterling or the euro we experienced 60 million 353 million and 230 million in foreign currency gains losses during fiscal years 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively the 2008 foreign currency loss includes a realized gain of 215 million due to the strengthening of the euro between the date we purchased shares in tele atlas nv in october 2007 and the tender of shares in february march and june 2008 to date we have not entered into hedging transactions with the euro the british pound sterling or the taiwan dollar and we do not currently plan to utilize hedging transactions in the future 

  

  

critical accounting policies and estimates 

 

general 

 

garmin’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon garmin’s consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the presentation of these financial statements requires garmin to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis garmin evaluates its estimates including those related to customer sales programs and incentives product returns bad debts inventories investments intangible assets income taxes warranty obligations and contingencies and litigation garmin bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

revenue recognition 

 

garmin recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred the sales price is fixed or determinable and collection is probable for the large majority of garmin’s sales these criteria are met once product has shipped and title and risk of loss have transferred to the customer the company recognizes revenue from the sale of hardware products and software bundled with hardware that is essential to the functionality of the hardware in accordance with general revenue recognition accounting guidance the company recognizes revenue in accordance with industry specific software accounting guidance for standalone sales of software products and sales of software bundled with hardware not essential to the functionality of the hardware the company generally does not offer specified or unspecified upgrade rights to its customers in connection with software sales 

garmin introduced nümaps lifetime™ in january 2009 which is a single fee program that subject to the program’s terms and conditions enables customers to download the latest map and point of interest information every quarter for the useful life of their pnd the revenue and associated cost of royalties for sales of nümaps lifetime™ products are deferred at the time of sale and recognized ratably on a straightline basis over the currently estimated threeyear life of the products 

for multielement arrangements that include tangible products that contain software that is essential to the tangible product’s functionality and undelivered software elements that relate to the tangible product’s essential software the company allocates revenue to all deliverables based on their relative selling prices in such circumstances the new accounting principles establish a hierarchy to determine the selling price to be used for allocating revenue to deliverables as follows i vendorspecific objective evidence of fair value “vsoe” ii thirdparty evidence of selling price “tpe” and iii best estimate of the selling price “esp” vsoe generally exists only when the company sells the deliverable separately and is the price actually charged by the company for that deliverable 

  

  

in 2009 garmin introduced the nüvi 1690 a premium pnd with a built‐in wireless module that lets customers access garmin’s nülink™ service which provides direct links to certain online information the company has identified two deliverables contained in arrangements involving the sale of the nüvi 1690 the first deliverable is the hardware and software essential to the functionality of the hardware device delivered at the time of sale and the second deliverable is the nülink service the company has allocated revenue between these two deliverables using the relative selling price method determined using vsoe amounts allocated to the delivered hardware and the related essential software are recognized at the time of sale provided the other conditions for revenue recognition have been met amounts allocated to the nülink services are deferred and recognized on a straightline basis over the 24month life of the service 

garmin records estimated reductions to revenue for customer sales programs returns and incentive offerings including rebates price protection product discounts offered to retailers to assist in clearing older products from their inventories in advance of new product releases promotions and other volumebased incentives the reductions to revenue are based on estimates and judgments using historical experience and expectation of future conditions changes in these estimates could negatively affect garmin’s operating results these incentives are reviewed periodically and with the exceptions of price protection and certain other promotions are accrued for on a percentage of sales basis if market conditions were to decline garmin may take actions to increase customer incentive offerings possibly resulting in an incremental reduction of revenue at the time the incentive is offered 

garmin records reductions to revenue for expected future product returns based on garmin’s historical experience 

 

trade accounts receivable 

we sell our products to retailers wholesalers and other customers and extend credit based on our evaluation of the customer’s financial condition potential losses on receivables are dependent on each individual customer’s financial condition we carry our trade accounts receivable at net realizable value typically our accounts receivable are collected within 60 days and do not bear interest we monitor our exposure to losses on receivables and maintain allowances for potential losses or adjustments we determine these allowances by 1 evaluating the aging of our receivables and 2 reviewing our highrisk customers past due receivable balances are written off when our internal collection efforts have been unsuccessful in collecting the amount due 

 

warranties 

 

garmin’s products are generally covered by a warranty for periods ranging from one to two years garmin accrues a warranty reserve for estimated costs to provide warranty services garmin’s estimate of costs to service its warranty obligations is based on historical experience and expectation of future conditions to the extent garmin experiences increased warranty claim activity or increased costs associated with servicing those claims its warranty accrual will increase resulting in decreased gross profit 

inventory 

 

garmin writes down its inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management additional inventory writedowns may be required 

  

  

investments 

investments are classified as available for sale and recorded at fair value and unrealized investment gains and losses are reflected in stockholders’ equity investment income is recorded when earned and capital gains and losses are recognized when investments are sold fair value of investments in auction rate securities are determined using third party estimates which followed an income approach valuation methodology investments are reviewed periodically to determine if they have suffered an impairment of value that is considered other than temporary if investments are determined to be impaired a capital loss is recognized at the date of determination 

testing for impairment of investments also requires significant management judgment the identification of potentially impaired investments the determination of their fair value and the assessment of whether any decline in value is other than temporary are the key judgment elements the discovery of new information and the passage of time can significantly change these judgments revisions of impairment judgments are made when new information becomes known and any resulting impairment adjustments are made at that time the economic environment and volatility of securities markets increase the difficulty of determining fair value and assessing investment impairment 

income taxes 

 

garmin provides deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the difference between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their carrying amount for financial reporting purposes as measured by the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse it is garmin’s policy to record a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to an amount that it believes is more likely than not to be realized while garmin has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance in the event garmin were to determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax assets in the future an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such determination is made likewise should garmin determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase income in the period such determination is made 

in addition the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations we recognize liabilities for tax audit issues in the us and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes will be due if payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary if our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment a further charge to expense would result 

stock based compensation 

garmin awards stock options stock appreciation rights “sars” restricted stock units “rsus” andor performance shares each year as part of garmin’s compensation package for employees employees with certain levels of responsibility within garmin are eligible for stock options sar grants rsu grants andor performance shares but the granting of options sars rsus andor performance shares is at the discretion of the compensation committee of the board of directors and is not a contractual obligation 

stockbased compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period determining the fair value of stockbased awards at the grant date requires judgment including estimating expected dividends in addition judgment is also required in estimating the amount of stockbased awards that are expected to be forfeited if actual results differ significantly from these estimates stockbased compensation expense could be impacted stock compensation plans are discussed in detail in note 9 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

  

  

accounting terms and characteristics 

net sales 

our net sales are primarily generated through sales to our global dealer and distributor network and to original equipment manufacturers refer to the revenue recognition discussion above our sales are largely of a consumer nature therefore backlog levels are not necessarily indicative of our future sales results we aim to achieve a quick turnaround on orders we receive and we typically ship most orders within 72 hours 

net sales are subject to seasonal fluctuation typically sales of our consumer products are highest in the second quarter due to increased demand during the spring and summer season and in the fourth quarter due to increased demand during the holiday buying season our aviation products do not experience much seasonal variation but are more influenced by the timing of the release of new products when the initial demand is typically the strongest 

gross profit 

 

raw material costs are our most significant component of cost of goods sold in 2009 gross margin for our automotivemobile segment increased 350 basis points as benefits from raw material price declines and operating efficiencies exceeded the average selling price decline in 2008 gross margin for our automotivemobile segment declined 310 basis points as the average selling price continued to decline and we experienced further shift in product mix to lowermargin product groups these impacts were somewhat offset by raw material price declines most significantly flash memory in the first half of 2007 we experienced favorable product mix and product pricing which allowed us to hold margins in our automotivemobile segment steady margin declines in the second half of 2007 were primarily a result of average selling price declines coupled with raw materials price increases most notably the costs for flash memory in late second quarter and through the third quarter of 2007 when we were purchasing these components for our holiday production runs resulting in margin declines as these components were sold primarily in the fourth quarter of 2007 gross margins for the aviation marine and outdoorfitness segments are more stable our longterm gross margin targets are 65 55 and 55 respectively for these segments 

our existing practice of performing the design and manufacture of our products inhouse has enabled us to utilize alternative lower cost components from different suppliers and where possible to redesign our products to permit us to use these lower cost components we believe that because of our practice of performing the design manufacture and marketing of our products inhouse our shijr jhongli and linkou manufacturing plants in taiwan our olathe kansas and salem oregon manufacturing plants have experienced relatively low costs of manufacturing in general products manufactured in taiwan have been our highest volume products our manufacturing labor costs historically have been lower in taiwan than in olathe and salem 

sales price variability has had and can be expected to have an effect on our gross profit in the past prices of our devices sold into the automotivemobile market have declined due to market pressures and introduction of new products sold at lower price points the average selling prices of our aviation outdoorfitness and marine products have increased due to product mix and the introduction of more advanced products sold at higher prices the effect of the sales price differences inherent within the mix of gpsenabled products sold could have a significant impact on our gross profit 

advertising expense 

our advertising expenses consist of costs for both media advertising and cooperative advertising with our retail partners as revenues grew in 20052008 advertising expense also increased in 2009 we reduced our advertising expense as revenues declined and the public became more aware of gps technology the reduction did not have a negative impact on our market share we expect advertising costs to increase in 2010 as revenues grow 

  

  

selling general and administrative expenses 

our selling general and administrative expenses consist primarily of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

due to the economic pressure on our consumeroriented business we decreased selling general and administrative expenses in 2009 as revenues grew in 20052008 selling general and administrative expenses also increased we expect selling general and administrative costs excluding advertising to increase in 2010 as revenues grow 

research and development 

the majority of our research and development costs represent salaries for our engineers costs for high technology components and costs of test equipment used in product and prototype development approximately 85 of the research and development of our products is performed in north america the remainder of our research and development activities is performed by our taiwan engineering group which has increased in size in recent years 

we are committed to increasing the level of innovative design and development of new products as we strive for expanded ability to serve our existing consumer and aviation markets as well as new markets for gpsenabled devices we continue to grow our research and development budget in absolute terms 

customers 

 

best buy accounted for 134 of our net sales in the year ended december 26 2009 our top ten customers have contributed between 27 and 43 of net sales since 2005 we have experienced average sales days in our customer accounts receivable of between 49 and 75 days since 2005 we have experienced an increase in the level of customer accounts receivable days due to changes in product mix longer payment terms and macroeconomic conditions we expect to reduce the level of customer accounts receivable days as we negotiate shorter payment terms with our customers 

  

  

income taxes 

 

we have experienced a relatively low effective corporate tax rate due to the proportion of our revenue generated by entities in tax jurisdictions with low statutory rates in particular the profit entitlement afforded our parent company based on its intellectual property rights ownership of our consumer products along with substantial tax incentives offered by the taiwanese government on certain hightechnology capital investments have continued to reduce our tax rate as a result our consolidated effective tax rate was approximately 129 during 2009 this is a decrease from 199 during 2008 due to a more favorable mix of taxable income among the tax jurisdictions in which the company operates and the release of income tax reserves for which the statute of limitations has expired we have taken advantage of the tax benefit in taiwan since our inception and we expect to continue to benefit from lower effective tax rates at least through 2013 we plan on applying for additional incentives for years beyond 2013 based on capital investments we expect to make in the future however there can be no assurance that such tax incentives will be available indefinitely or that we will receive the incentives for which we apply management believes that due to lower operating margins predicted for fiscal 2010 there may be slightly less revenue recognized by entities in lower tax rate jurisdictions therefore the effective tax rate for fiscal 2010 is expected to be slightly higher than fiscal 2009 the actual effective tax rate will be dependent upon the operating margins production volume additional capital investments made during fiscal 2010 and the composition of our earnings

comparison of 52weeks ended december 26 2009 and december 27 2008 

net sales 

 

net sales decreased 157 in 2009 when compared to the yearago period the decrease occurred across all segments except outdoorfitness with the greatest decreases in the automotivemobile and aviation segments automotivemobile revenue remains the largest portion of our revenue mix but declined from 726 in 2008 to 697 in 2009 

total unit sales decreased 2 to 166 million in 2009 from 169 million in 2008 the lower unit sales volume was attributable to declining volumes across all segments excluding outdoorfitness with the greatest percentage declines occurring in aviation and marine the lower volumes were driven primarily by the macroeconomic conditions and reduced inventory levels with many of our retail partners 

automotivemobile segment revenue declined 191 in 2009 as the average selling price declined 18 and volumes declined 2 average selling price declines continue to be attributable to the competitive environment in which our automotivemobile products compete the aviation and marine segments declined 240 and 131 respectively in 2009 as both industries experienced significant slowdowns associated with the macroeconomic conditions outdoorfitness segment revenue increased 96 due to new product introductions including the dakota™ series the forerunner® 405cx the forerunner® 310xt and edge® 500 and increasing global penetration of the fitness category all segments showed improving trends in the second half of 2009 as the macroeconomic conditions improved 

the company anticipates revenue growth between 05 in 2010 driven by mobile product initiatives and growth in the outdoorfitness aviation and marine segments in general management believes that continuous innovation and the introduction of new products are essential for future revenue growth 

gross profit 

 

the decrease in gross profit dollars was primarily attributable to the automotivemobile and aviation segments where the effects of revenue declines were partially offset by the improved gross margins earned gross profit margin percentage for the company overall increased 450 basis points as margins expanded in all segments 

  

  

the automotivemobile segment gross profit margin percentage increase of 350 basis points was driven by material costs reductions partially offset by inventory reserves associated with the mobile handset initiative and price declines management believes that gross margins for this segment will decline in 2010 due to ongoing price declines outpacing product cost declines outdoorfitness gross margin increased principally due to a newer suite of higher margin products gross profit margin percentage for marine and aviation increased compared to 2008 due to increased average selling price and decreases in per unit costs driven by product mix and material cost reductions 

advertising expenses 

 

advertising expense decreased both as a percentage of sales and in absolute dollars when compared to 2008 as a percent of sales advertising expenses declined to 53 in 2009 compared to 60 in 2008 the decrease was a result of actions taken by the company to reduce costs as the macroeconomic conditions impacted sales across our segments and around the world combined with lower cooperative advertising which is tied to net sales levels management expects to maintain advertising as a percentage of sales constant in 2010 

selling general and administrative expenses 

 

selling general and administrative expense decreased 47 in 2009 while it increased as a percentage of sales compared to 2008 as costs throughout the company were reduced but not as rapidly as the revenue declines the decline in costs was primarily related to a reduction in bad debt expense due to specific reserves recorded in 2008 as a result of vendor bankruptcies offset by increased costs for product support and information technology as our installed base of users continues to grow the increased expense for the outdoorfitness segment and the decreased expense for the automotivemobile segment were driven by the allocation of costs based on revenues as outdoorfitness revenues have increased as a percentage of revenues additional selling general and administrative expenses are shifted to the segment as a percent of sales selling general and administrative expenses increased from 79 in 2008 to 90 of sales in 2009 as revenues declined management expects to maintain selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales constant in 2010 

research and development expense 

 

  

  

the increase in research and development expense dollars was due to ongoing development activities for new products including the mobile handset initiative the addition of 230 new engineering personnel to our staff during the period and an increase in engineering program costs in 2009 as a result of our continued emphasis on product innovation management believes that one of the key strategic initiatives for future growth and success of garmin is continuous innovation development and introduction of new products management expects that its research and development expenses will increase approximately 20 during fiscal 2010 on an absolute dollar basis due to the anticipated introduction of a strong portfolio of new products including mobile handsets slated for fiscal 2010 management expects to continue to invest in the research and development of new products and technology in order to maintain garmin’s competitive advantage in the markets in which it competes 

other income expense 

 

other income expense principally consists of interest income and foreign currency exchange gains and losses other income expense was lower in fiscal 2009 relative to fiscal 2008 with the majority of this difference caused by a large gain on sale of equity securities in 2008 interest income for fiscal 2009 decreased due to lower interest rates partially offset by higher cash and marketable securities balances 

foreign currency gains and losses for the company are primarily tied to movements by the taiwan dollar the euro and the british pound sterling the us dollar remains the functional currency of garmin europe ltd the euro is the functional currency of all other european subsidiaries excluding garmin danmark and garmin sweden as these entities have grown euro currency moves generated material gains and losses additionally eurobased intercompany transactions in garmin ltd can also generate currency gains and losses the canadian dollar danish krone swedish krona and australian dollar are the functional currency of dynastream innovations inc garmin danmark garmin sweden and garmin australasia respectively due to these entities’ relative size currency moves are not expected to have a material impact on the company’s financial statements 

the 60 million currency loss in 2009 was due to the weakening of the us dollar compared to the euro the british pound sterling and the taiwan dollar during 2009 the us dollar weakened 24 and 83 compared to the euro and the british pound sterling respectively resulting in a gain of 58 million a loss of 161 million resulted due to the us dollar weakening 23 against the taiwan dollar the relative weakness of the taiwan dollar and eurobritish pound sterling have offsetting impacts due to the use of the taiwan dollar for manufacturing costs while the euro and british pound sterling transactions relate to revenue the remaining net currency gain of 43 million related to other currencies and timing of transactions 

the 353 million currency loss in 2008 was related to the strengthening of the us dollar offset by a gain associated with the sales and tender of our tele atlas nv shares during 2008 the taiwan dollar weakened 16 in comparison to the us dollar resulting in a 208 million gain the euro weakened 41 and the british pound sterling weakened 261 relative to the us dollar in 2008 which resulted in a 773 million loss offsetting this net loss was a realized gain of 215 million due to the strengthening of the euro between the date of purchase of the tele atlas nv shares in october 2007 to the dates of tender in february march and june 2008 other net currency losses and the timing of transactions created the remaining loss of 03 million 

  

  

gain on sale of equity of securities of 509 million in 2008 was primarily generated from the sale of our equity interest in tele atlas nv which we acquired in 2007 in connection with our announced intent to make a cash offer for all outstanding shares which was subsequently abandoned 

income tax provision 

our fiscal 2009 earnings before taxes fell 116 when compared to 2008 while our income tax expense decreased 423 income taxes fell 768 million to 1047 million for fiscal year 2009 from 1815 million for fiscal year 2008 due to a lower effective tax rate and the reduced earnings before taxes the effective tax rate was 129 for fiscal 2009 compared to 199 for fiscal 2008 the decrease in tax rate is due to the favorable mix of taxable income among the tax jurisdictions in which the company operates and the release of income tax reserves for which the statute of limitations has expired 

net income 

as a result of the various factors noted above net income decreased 39 to 7040 million for fiscal year 2009 compared to 7328 million for fiscal year 2008 

comparison of 52weeks ended december 27 2008 and december 29 2007 

net sales 

 

the increase in total net sales for 2008 was primarily driven by outdoorfitness automotivemobile and aviation product offerings automotivemobile revenue remains a significantly larger portion of our revenue mix decreasing slightly from 736 in 2007 to 726 in 2008 total unit sales increased 38 to 169 million in 2008 from 123 million in 2007 the higher unit sales volume in 2008 was primarily attributable to strong sales of automotive products particularly in north america and outdoorfitness products in general management believes that continuous innovation and the introduction of new products are essential for future revenue growth 

automotivemobile segment revenue grew 84 in 2008 on the strength of the nuvi ® series of personal navigation devices pnds as well as increased consumer awareness of the capabilities and applications of gps on a percentage basis revenues in our outdoorfitness segment grew faster than any other segment from the year ago period due to the introduction of the colorado™ series the oregon ™ series the forerunner ® 405 and edge ® 705 which offer enhanced form factors and cartography our aviation segment continued to grow on the strength of our g1000 cockpit as an oem original equipment manufacturer solution this growth slowed significantly in the second half of 2008 as the macroeconomic conditions influenced purchasing decisions and slowed oem production schedules marine revenues were slightly higher than the prior year due to strong growth in the first quarter of 2008 offset by flat to declining revenue in the remainder of the year due to macroeconomic conditions and fuel prices 

  

  

gross profit 

 

the increase in gross profit dollars was primarily attributable to the outdoorfitness and aviation segments where revenue growth and consistent margins contributed gross profit margin percentage for the company overall decreased 150 basis points as a result of the automotivemobile segment decline of 310 basis points offset to some extent by strong gross margins in our other three segments the automotivemobile segment is by nature a lowermargin business and the company has begun to see the impacts expected on gross margin due to falling prices and a product mix shift toward lower end pnds outdoorfitness gross margin has increased due to a newer suite of products a product mix favoring the high margin g1000 in the aviation segment resulted in favorable gross margins for the aviation segment in 2008 marine gross margin remained relatively stable and within historic ranges 

advertising expenses 

 

 

advertising expenses increased by 12 million on a yearoveryear basis as we reduced activities during the second half of the year due to moderating growth associated with the macroeconomic pressures 

selling general and administrative expenses 

 

the increase in selling general and administrative expense was driven primarily by costs associated with the european distributors acquired in 2007 and 2008 increased staffing to support our growth and bad debt expense selling general and administrative expenses excluding advertising increased by 877 million in 2008 due to the acquired european distributors information technology call center operations and other administrative areas to support the growth of our businesses as well as bad debt expense due to the bankruptcy of circuit city 

  

  

research and development expense 

 

the increase in research and development expense dollars was due to ongoing development activities for new products the addition of 350 new engineering personnel to our staff during the period and an increase in engineering program costs in 2008 as a result of our continued emphasis on product innovation 

other income expense 

 

other income expense principally consists of interest income and foreign currency exchange gains and losses other income expense was lower in fiscal 2008 relative to fiscal 2007 with the majority of this difference caused by a large foreign currency loss in 2008 interest income for fiscal 2008 decreased due to lower interest rates and a decline in our cash and marketable securities balances during the year 

foreign currency gains and losses for the company are primarily tied to movements by the taiwan dollar the euro and the british pound sterling the us dollar remains the functional currency of garmin europe ltd the euro is the functional currency of all other european subsidiaries excluding garmin danmark and garmin sweden as these entities have grown euro currency moves generated material gains and losses additionally eurobased intercompany transactions in garmin ltd can also generate currency gains and losses the canadian dollar danish krone swedish krona and australian dollar are the functional currency of dynastream innovations inc garmin danmark garmin sweden and garmin australasia respectively due to these entities’ relative size currency moves are not expected to have a material impact on the company’s financial statements 

the 353 million currency loss in 2008 was related to the strengthening of the us dollar offset by a gain associated with the sales and tender of our tele atlas nv shares during 2008 the taiwan dollar weakened 16 in comparison to the us dollar resulting in a 208 million gain the euro weakened 41 and the british pound sterling weakened 261 relative to the us dollar in 2008 which resulted in a 773 million loss offsetting this net loss was a realized gain of 215 million due to the strengthening of the euro between the date of purchase of the tele atlas nv shares in october 2007 to the dates of tender in february march and june 2008 other net currency losses and the timing of transactions created the remaining loss of 03 million 

the majority of the 230 million currency gain in fiscal 2007 was due to the weakening of the us dollar compared to the euro and the british pound sterling during fiscal 2007 the taiwan dollar strengthened relative to the us dollar resulting in a 25 million loss the british pound sterling and the euro strengthened 2 and 114 respectively relative to the us dollar during fiscal 2007 which resulted in a 256 million gain other net currency gains and the timing of transactions created the remaining loss of 01 million 

  

  

other income of 509 million in 2008 was primarily generated from the sale of our equity interest in tele atlas nv which we acquired in 2007 in connection with our announced intent to make a cash offer for all outstanding shares which was subsequently abandoned 

income tax provision 

our earnings before taxes fell 65 when compared to 2007 yet our income tax expense increased by 582 million to 1815 million for fiscal year 2008 from 1233 million for fiscal year 2007 due to a higher effective tax rate the effective tax rate was 199 for fiscal 2008 compared to 126 for fiscal 2007 the increase in tax rate is due to a change in tax law related to the repatriation of earnings from our taiwan subsidiary and the unfavorable mix of taxable income among the tax jurisdictions in which the company operates 

net income 

as a result of the various factors noted above net income decreased 14 to 7328 million for fiscal year 2008 compared to 8550 million for fiscal year 2007 

liquidity and capital resources 

net cash generated by operations was 10945 million 8622 million and 6821 million for fiscal years 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively in general cash from operations has been derived from strong income levels and improved working capital management the increase in 2009 was principally related to reductions in inventories and increases in deferred revenues and accrued expenses offset by the cash flow effects of increased accounts receivable due to the seasonally strong fourth quarter deferred revenues relate to the nümaps lifetime™ offering as discussed in critical accounting policies accrued expenses increased primarily due to the timing of license fee payments with regard to inventory we operate with a customeroriented approach and seek to maintain sufficient inventory to meet customer demand because we desire to respond quickly to our customers and minimize order fulfillment time our inventory levels are generally substantial enough to meet most demand we also attempt to carry sufficient inventory levels of key components so that potential supplier shortages have as minimal an impact as possible on our ability to deliver our finished products we do not plan to further reduce inventory levels in 2010 

capital expenditures in 2009 totaled 492 million a decrease of 704 million from fiscal 2008 this amount in 2009 is related to business operations and maintenance activities this amount in 2008 reflects the buildout of additional manufacturing lines in linkou taiwan completion of our expanded north american distribution facility and maintenance activities capital expenditures in 2007 totaled 1568 million this amount in 2007 reflects the purchase and buildout of an additional manufacturing facility in linkou taiwan continued expansion of research and development facilities in our taiwan facilities as well as ordinary capital expenditures for fiscal 2007 

we have budgeted approximately 50 million of capital expenditures during fiscal 2010 to include normal ongoing capital expenditures and maintenance activities 

in addition to capital expenditures 2009 cash flow used in investing activities related to the net investment in fixed income securities of our onhand cash balances of 4910 million and the purchase of intangible assets for 76 million garmin’s average return on its investment during 2009 was approximately 17 this is a decrease from returns in prior years due to lower interest rates available in the market in addition to capital expenditures 2008 cash flow used in investing related to the purchase of european distributors for a total of 601 million the net sale of 1307 million of fixed income securities associated with the investment of our onhand cash balances and the purchase of 70 million of intangible assets the net sale of fixed income securities was primarily related to 2393 million of cash generated from the tender of our shares of tele atlas nv garmin’s average return on its investments during fiscal 2008 was approximately 34 in addition to capital expenditures 2007 cash flow used in investing related to the purchase of digital cyclone inc garmin france sas garmin deutschland gmbh garmin iberia sa garmin italia spa and the assets of nautamatic marine systems inc for a total of 1288 million the net sale of 1128 million of fixed income securities associated with the investment of our onhand cash balances and the purchase of 29 million of intangible assets the 1128 million net sale of fixed income securities includes the purchase of 1882 million of tele atlas nv outstanding shares in connection with our announced intent to make a cash offer for all outstanding shares which was subsequently abandoned garmin’s average return on its investments during fiscal 2007 was approximately 43 it is management’s goal to invest the onhand cash consistent with garmin’s investment policy which has been approved by the board of directors the investment policy’s primary purpose is to preserve capital maintain an acceptable degree of liquidity and maximize yield within the constraint of low credit risk 

  

  

net cash used by financing activities during 2009 was 1612 million resulting from the use of 1498 million for the payment of a dividend and 203 million for the purchase of stock offset by 89 million from the issuance of common shares related to the exercise of employee stock options and stock appreciation rights and the related tax benefit during 2009 garmin repurchased 707600 of its common shares under the 300 million stock repurchase program that was approved by the board of directors on october 22 2008 and expired on december 31 2009 refer to “item 5 market for the company’s common shares related shareholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities” for additional discussion regarding the 2008 share repurchase programs   net cash used by financing activities during 2008 was 8081 million resulting from the use of 6718 million for the stock repurchases and 1503 million for the payment of a dividend offset by 140 million from the issuance of common shares related to the exercise of employee stock options and stock appreciation rights and the related tax benefit the 6718 million of share repurchases represented 171 million common shares cash flow related to financing activities resulted in a net use of cash in 2007 of 1361 million during 2007 garmin repurchased 57235 of its common shares under the 3000000share stock repurchase program that was approved by the board of directors on august 3 2006 and expired on december 31 2007 sources and uses in financing activities during 2007 related primarily to a use for the payment of a dividend 1625 million and the purchase of stock 78 million and a source of cash from the issuance of common shares related to the exercise of employee stock options and stock appreciation rights the related tax benefit and the employee stock purchase plan 344 million 

cash dividends paid to shareholders were 1498 million 1503 million and 1625 million during fiscal years 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively 

we currently use cash flow from operations to fund our capital expenditures to support our working capital requirements and to repurchase shares we expect that future cash requirements will principally be for capital expenditures working capital repurchase of shares payment of dividends declared and the funding of strategic acquisitions 

we believe that our existing cash balances and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our projected capital expenditures working capital and other cash requirements at least through the end of fiscal 2010 

contractual obligations and commercial commitments 

future commitments of garmin as of december 26 2009 aggregated by type of contractual obligation are 

 

  

  

 

operating leases describes lease obligations associated with garmin facilities located in the us taiwan europe and canada purchase obligations are the aggregate of those purchase orders that were outstanding on december 26 2009 these obligations are created and then paid off within 3 months during the normal course of our manufacturing business 

we may be required to make significant cash outlays related to unrecognized tax benefits however due to the uncertainty of the timing of future cash flows associated with our unrecognized tax benefits we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement if any with the respective taxing authorities accordingly unrecognized tax benefits of 2557 million as of december 26 2009 have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above for further information related to unrecognized tax benefits see note 2 “income taxes” to the consolidated financial statements included in this report 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we do not have any offbalance sheet arrangements 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market sensitivity 

 

we have market risk primarily in connection with the pricing of our products and services and the purchase of raw materials product pricing and raw materials costs are both significantly influenced by semiconductor market conditions historically during cyclical industry downturns we have been able to offset pricing declines for our products through a combination of improved product mix and success in obtaining price reductions in raw materials costs 

inflation 

we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our business financial condition or results of operations if our costs were to become subject to significant inflationary pressures we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs through price increases our inability or failure to do so could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

the operation of garmin’s subsidiaries in international markets results in exposure to movements in currency exchange rates we have experienced significant foreign currency gains and losses due to the strengthening and weakening of the us dollar the potential of volatile foreign exchange rate fluctuations in the future could have a significant effect on our results of operations 

the currencies that create a majority of the company’s exchange rate exposure are the taiwan dollar euro and british pound sterling garmin corporation headquartered in shijr taiwan uses the local currency as the functional currency the company translates all assets and liabilities at yearend exchange rates and income and expense accounts at average rates during the year in order to minimize the effect of the currency exchange fluctuations on our net assets we have elected to retain most of our taiwan subsidiary’s cash and investments in marketable securities denominated in us dollars in 2009 the taiwan dollar strengthened 23 relative to the us dollar which resulted in a net foreign currency loss of 161 million at garmin corporation during 2009 

  

  

all european subsidiaries excluding garmin europe ltd garmin danmark and garmin sweden use the euro as the functional currency  the functional currency of our largest european subsidiary garmin europe ltd remains the us dollar and as some transactions occurred in british pounds sterling or euros foreign currency gains or losses have been realized historically related to the movements of those currencies relative to the us dollar the company believes that gains and losses will become more material in the future as our european presence grows in 2009 the euro strengthened 24 relative to the us dollar and the british pound sterling strengthened 83 relative to the us dollar these currency moves resulted in a foreign currency gain of 58 million in garmin ltd and our european subsidiaries the net result of these currency moves combined with other gains of 43 million and the timing of transactions during the year was a net loss of 60 million for the company and a cumulative translation adjustment of 93 million at the end of fiscal 2009 

interest rate risk 

we have no outstanding longterm debt as of december 26 2009 we therefore have no meaningful debtrelated interest rate risk 

we are exposed to interest rate risk in connection with our investments in marketable securities as interest rates change the unrealized gains and losses associated with those securities will fluctuate accordingly a hypothetical change of 10 in interest rates would not have a material effect on such unrealized gains or losses at december 26 2009 cumulative unrealized losses on those securities were 218 million

company overview 

garmin is a leading worldwide provider of navigation communication and information devices and applications most of which are enabled by global positioning system “gps” technology garmin designs develops manufactures and markets a diverse family of handheld portable and fixedmount gpsenabled products and other navigation communications and information products for the automotivemobile outdoorfitness marine and general aviation markets 

 

  

  

overview of the global positioning system 

the global positioning system is a worldwide navigation system which enables the precise determination of geographic location using established satellite technology the system consists of a constellation of orbiting satellites the satellites and their ground control and monitoring stations are maintained and operated by the united states department of defense which maintains an ongoing satellite replenishment program to ensure continuous global system coverage access to the system is provided free of charge by the us government 

prior to may 2000 the us department of defense intentionally degraded the accuracy of civilian gps signals in a process known as selective availability ‘‘sa’’ for national security purposes sa variably degraded gps position accuracy to a radius of 100 meters on may 2 2000 the us department of defense discontinued sa in a presidential policy statement issued in december 2004 the bush administration indicated that the us does not intend to implement sa again and is committed to preventing hostile use of gps through regional denial of service minimizing the impact to peaceful users with sa removed a gps receiver can calculate its position to an accuracy of approximately 10 meters or less enhancing the utility of gps for most applications 

the accuracy and utility of gps can be enhanced through augmentation techniques which compute any remaining errors in the signal and broadcast these corrections to a gps device the federal aviation administration “faa” has developed a wide area augmentation system ‘‘waas’’ comprising ground reference stations and additional satellites that improve the accuracy of gps positioning available in the united states and portions of canada and mexico to approximately 3 meters waas supports the use of gps as the primary means of enroute terminal and approach navigation for aviation in the united states the increased accuracy offered by waas also enhances the utility of waasenabled gps receivers for consumer applications the faa announced on july 11 2003 that the waas system had achieved initial operating capability and that the system was available for instrument flight use with appropriately certified avionics equipment since that time the faa has installed additional ground reference stations and has launched additional waas satellites

competition 

the market for navigation communications and information products is highly competitive garmin believes the principal competitive factors impacting the market for its products are design functionality quality and reliability customer service brand price timetomarket and availability garmin believes that it generally competes favorably in each of these areas 

garmin believes that its principal competitors for portable automotive products are tomtom nv and mitac digital corporation which distributes products under the brand names of magellan mio and navman and navigon ag garmin believes that its principal competitors for outdoor product lines are magellan and lowrance electronics inc a subsidiary of navico holding as “lowrance” for marine chartplotter products garmin believes that its principal competitors are raymarine ltd “raymarine” furuno electronic company “furuno” lowrance and simrad yachting as “simrad” for garmin’s fishfinderdepth sounder product lines garmin believes that its principal competitors are lowrance raymarine the humminbird division of johnson outdoors inc simrad and furuno for garmin’s general aviation product lines garmin considers its principal competitors to be lowrance for portable gps units and honeywell inc avidyne corporation l3 avionics systems rockwell collins inc universal avionics systems corporation chelton flight systems aspen avionics and free flight systems for panelmount gps and display units for garmin’s family radio service and general mobile radio service product line garmin believes that its principal competitors are motorola inc “motorola” cobra electronics corporation and midland radio corporation garmin believes that its principal competitors for smartphones are apple inc htc corporation nokia oyj samsung corporation and sony ericsson mobile communications ab 

research and development 

garmin’s product innovations are driven by its strong emphasis on research and development and the close partnership between garmin’s engineering and manufacturing teams garmin’s products are created by its engineering and development staff which numbered 1738 people worldwide as of december 27 2008 garmin’s manufacturing staff includes manufacturing process engineers who work closely with garmin’s design engineers to ensure manufacturability and manufacturing cost control for its products garmin’s development staff includes industrial designers as well as software engineers electrical engineers mechanical engineers and cartographic engineers garmin believes the industrial design of its products has played an important role in garmin’s success once a development project is initiated and approved a multidisciplinary team is created to design the product and transition it into manufacturing 

below is a table of garmin’s expenditures on research and development over the last three fiscal years 

 

manufacturing and operations 

garmin believes that one of its core competencies is its manufacturing capability at its shijr jhongli and linkou taiwan facilities its olathe kansas facility and its salem oregon facility garmin believes that its vertically integrated approach has provided it the following benefits 

reduced timetomarket utilizing concurrent engineering techniques garmin’s products are introduced to production at an early development stage and the feedback provided by manufacturing is incorporated into the design before mass production begins in this manner garmin attempts to reduce the time required to move a product from its design phase to mass production deliveries with improved quality and yields 

design and process optimization garmin uses its manufacturing resources to rapidly prototype design concepts products and processes in order to achieve higher efficiency lower cost and better value for customers garmin’s ability to fully explore product design and manufacturing process concepts has enabled it to optimize its designs to minimize size and weight in gps devices that are functional waterproof and rugged 

logistical agility operating its own manufacturing facilities helps garmin minimize problems such as component shortages and long component lead times which are common in the electronics industry many products can be reengineered to bypass component shortages or reduce cost and the new designs can be delivered to market quickly garmin reacts rapidly to changes in market demand by striving to maintain a safety stock of longlead components and by rescheduling components from one product line to another 

garmin’s design manufacturing distribution and servicing processes in our us taiwan and uk facilities are certified to iso 9001 an international quality standard developed by the international organization for standardization garmin’s taiwan manufacturing facilities have also achieved ts 16949 certification a quality standard for automotive suppliers in addition garmin’s aviation operations have achieved certification to as9100 the quality standard for the aviation industry 

garmin europe ltd and garmin corporation have also achieved certification of their environmental management systems to the iso14001 standard this certification recognizes that garmin’s uk and taiwan subsidiaries have systems and processes in place to minimize or prevent harmful effects on the environment and to strive continually to improve its environmental performance 

materials 

garmin purchases components for its products from a number of suppliers around the world for certain components garmin relies on sole source suppliers the failure of our suppliers to deliver components in sufficient quantities and in a timely manner could adversely affect our business 

seasonality 

our sales are subject to significant seasonal fluctuation sales of our consumer products are generally significantly higher in the fourth quarter due to increased demand for automotivemobile products during the holiday buying season and to a lesser extent the second quarter due to increased demand during the spring and summer marine season and the father’s daygraduation buying season sales of consumer products are also influenced by the timing of the release of new products our aviation products do not experience much seasonal variation but are more influenced by the timing of the release of new products when the initial demand is typically the strongest 

backlog 

our sales are generally of a consumer nature and there is a relatively short cycle between order and shipment therefore we believe that backlog information is not material to the understanding of our business we typically ship most orders within 72 hours of receipt 

intellectual property 

our success and ability to compete is dependent in part on our proprietary technology we rely on a combination of patent copyright trademark and trade secret laws as well as confidentiality agreements to establish and protect our proprietary rights as of january 27 2009 we held 307 us utility patents 77 us design patents 16 foreign patents and 26 foreign registered designs as of january 27 2009 we held 127 us utility patent applications 16 us design patent applications 33 foreign patent applications and 3 foreign design applications pending in addition garmin often relies on licenses of intellectual property for use in its business for example garmin obtains licenses for digital cartography technology for use in our products from various sources as of january 27 2009 we held 96 us trademark registrations and 191 foreign trademark registrations as of january 27 2009 we had 11 us trademark applications and 46 foreign trademark applications pending 

 

we believe that our continued success depends on the intellectual skills of our employees and their ability to continue to innovate garmin will continue to file and prosecute patent applications when appropriate to attempt to protect garmin’s rights in its proprietary technologies garmin was selected as a constituent of the ocean tomo® 300 patent index and the ocean tomo® 300 patent growth index which are indices that recognize companies with high intellectual property value 

there is no assurance that our current patents or patents which we may later acquire may successfully withstand any challenge in whole or in part it is also possible that any patent issued to us may not provide us with any competitive advantages or that the patents of others will preclude us from manufacturing and marketing certain products despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights to protect our trade secrets to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others or to defend against claims of infringement or invalidity 

regulations 

the telecommunications industry is highly regulated and the regulatory environment in which garmin operates is subject to change in accordance with federal communications commission “fcc” rules and regulations wireless transceiver and cellular handset products are required to be certified by the fcc and comparable authorities in foreign countries where they are sold garmin’s products sold in europe are required to comply with relevant directives of the european commission a delay in receiving required certifications for new products or enhancements to garmin’s products or losing certification for garmin’s existing products could adversely affect our business in addition aviation products that are intended for installation in “type certificated aircraft” are required to be certified by the faa its european counterpart the european aviation safety agency and other comparable organizations before they can be used in an aircraft 

because garmin corporation one of the company’s principal subsidiaries is located in taiwan foreign exchange control laws and regulations of taiwan with respect to remittances into and out of taiwan may have an impact on garmin’s operations the taiwan foreign exchange control statute and regulations thereunder provide that all foreign exchange transactions must be executed by banks designated to handle such business by the ministry of finance of taiwan and by the central bank of the republic of china taiwan also referred to as the cbc current regulations favor traderelated foreign exchange transactions consequently foreign currency earned from exports of merchandise and services may now be retained and used freely by exporters while all foreign currency needed for the import of merchandise and services may be purchased freely from the designated foreign exchange banks aside from traderelated foreign exchange transactions taiwan companies and residents may without foreign exchange approval remit outside and into taiwan foreign currencies of up to 50 million and 5 million respectively or their equivalent each calendar year currency conversions within the limits are processed by the designated banks and do not have to be reviewed and approved by the cbc the above limits apply to remittances involving a conversion between new taiwan dollars and us dollars or other foreign currencies the cbc typically approves foreign exchange in excess of the limits if a party applies with the cbc for review and presents legitimate business reasons justifying the currency conversion a requirement is also imposed on all enterprises to register all medium and longterm foreign debt with the cbc 

environmental matters 

the european union “eu” enacted the restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment directive rohs directive and the waste electrical and electronic equipment directive “weee directive” the rohs directive requires eu member states to enact laws prohibiting the use of certain substances including lead mercury cadmium and hexavalent chromium in certain electronic products put on the market after july 1 2006 the weee directive requires eu member states to enact laws that were to go into effect by august 13 2005 regulating the collection recovery and recycling of waste from certain electronic products we modified the design of our products and our manufacturing processes in order to comply with such laws and regulations 

 

the eu has also enacted the registration evaluation and authorization of chemicals “reach” regulation reach requires manufacturers and importers of articles to register the substances contained in the articles if the substances are intended to be released under normal or reasonably foreseeable conditions of use because the substances contained in our products are not intended to be released under normal or reasonably foreseeable conditions of use we do not believe we or the importers of our products have an obligation under reach to register those substances it is possible however that garmin could participate in the reach regulations as necessary to support possible reach registration requirements of the recyclers of our products reach also imposes notification requirements on manufacturers and importers of articles if the articles contain “substances of very high concern” we have established a program in order to comply when and to the extent necessary 

portable garmin products which use acdc adapters as an option for battery charging would require submissions of energyuse profiles if and when the future implementing measures resulting from the eu eup energy using products directive define such products as being within their scope 

garmin products may also become subject to further energy efficiency requirements if and when required under us federal climate change legislation 

the people’s republic of china has enacted legislation which is widely known as “china rohs” the first phase of china rohs took effect on march 1 2007 and requires the disclosure and marking of certain substances including lead mercury cadmium and hexavalent chromium in certain electronic products we have established a program in order to comply with the first phase of china rohs 

other states and countries have promulgated or proposed legislation similar to the rohs directive andor the weee directive the need for and cost of our compliance with such legislation cannot yet be determined but the cost could be substantial 

several states have enacted laws pertaining to the reduction of mercury in products and the labeling of mercurycontaining products including the member states of the interstate mercury education and reduction clearinghouse imerc some of these laws including those in connecticut new york vermont and louisiana are applicable to certain of garmin’s gps products we have established an ongoing compliance program to ensure that we are fulfilling the notice and labeling requirements set forth in the relevant mercury legislation 

garmin has implemented multiple environmental management system “ems” policies in accordance with the international organization for standardization iso 14001 standard for environmental health and safety management garmin’s ems policies set forth practices standards and procedures to ensure compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations at garmin’s kansas headquarters facility garmin’s european headquarters facility and garmin’s taiwan manufacturing facility 

employees 

as of december 31 2008 garmin had 8919   full and parttime employees worldwide of whom 2896 were in the united states 76 were in canada 5253 were in taiwan 644 were in europe and 50 were in other global locations except for some of garmin’s employees in brazil iceland and sweden none of garmin’s employees are represented by a labor union and none of garmins north american or taiwan employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement garmin considers its employee relations to be good 

 




 item 1a risk factors 

the risks described below are not the only ones facing our company additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also impair our business operations if any of the following risks occur our business financial condition or operating results could be materially adversely affected 

risks related to the company 

economic conditions and uncertainty could adversely affect our revenue and margins 

global financial market downturns increased significantly during the fourth quarter of 2008 falling equity market values depressed housing markets credit market constraints weakened consumer confidence and increased unemployment have created fears of a severe recession our revenue and margins depend significantly on general economic conditions and the demand for products in the markets in which we compete the current economic weakness and constrained consumer and business spending has resulted and may result in the future in decreased revenue margins earnings or growth rates and problems with our ability to manage inventory levels and collect customer receivables in addition financial difficulties experienced by our retailer and oem customers have resulted and could result in the future in significant bad debt writeoffs and additions to reserves in our receivables and could have an adverse affect on our results of operations the current economic recession also may lead to restructuring actions and associated expenses 

our financial results are highly dependent on the automotivemobile segment which now represents over 70 of our revenues and may be maturing leading to lesser growth than we have experienced in the past 

  we have experienced substantial growth in the automotivemobile segment of our business in recent years as the products have become massmarket consumer electronics in both europe and north america this market growth may now be slowing as penetration rates increase and competing technologies emerge slowing growth along with the significant price reductions that have occurred during the past two years could result in lower revenues as margins have also declined in this segment slowing growth may also result in lower earnings per share 

the demand for personal navigation devices pnds may be eroded by replacement technologies becoming available on mobile handsets and factoryinstalled systems in new autos 

we have experienced substantial growth in the automotivemobile segment which has resulted in gpsnavigation technologies being incorporated into competing devices such as mobile handsets and new automobiles through factoryinstalled systems mobile handsets are frequently gpsenabled and many companies are now offering navigation software for mobile devices the acceptance of this technology by consumers could slow our growth and further reduce margins navigation systems are becoming more prevalent as optional equipment on new automobiles increased navigation penetration on new automobiles could slow our growth and further reduce margins 

best buy is a significant customer representing over 10 of net sales accordingly our revenues and profitability will be adversely impacted if best buy’s business declines or if best buy is unable to pay timely 

best buy is our largest customer and accounted for 120 of our total net sales in 2008 if best buy’s business declines due to the economic conditions market share losses or other factors our revenues and profitability will be adversely impacted in addition if best buy’s liquidity erodes for any of the reasons discussed above or a tightening in the credit markets and they are unwilling or unable to pay timely our profitability will be adversely impacted 

 

many of our products rely on the global positioning system 

the global positioning system is a satellitebased navigation and positioning system consisting of a constellation of orbiting satellites the satellites and their ground control and monitoring stations are maintained and operated by the united states department of defense the department of defense does not currently charge users for access to the satellite signals these satellites and their ground support systems are complex electronic systems subject to electronic and mechanical failures and possible sabotage the satellites were originally designed to have lives of 75 years and are subject to damage by the hostile space environment in which they operate however of the current deployment of satellites in place some have been operating for more than 13 years 

if a significant number of satellites were to become inoperable unavailable or are not replaced it would impair the current utility of our global positioning system products and would have a material negative effect on our business in addition there can be no assurance that the us government will remain committed to the operation and maintenance of global positioning system satellites over a long period or that the policies of the us government that provide for the use of the global positioning system without charge and without accuracy degradation will remain unchanged because of the increasing commercial applications of the global positioning system other us government agencies may become involved in the administration or the regulation of the use of global positioning system signals however in a presidential policy statement issued in december 2004 the bush administration indicated that the us is committed to supporting and improving the global positioning system and will continue providing it free from direct user fees 

some of our products also use signals from systems that augment gps such as the wide area augmentation system waas waas is operated by the faa any curtailment of the operating capability of waas could result in decreased user capability for many of our aviation products thereby impacting our markets 

any of the foregoing factors could affect the willingness of buyers of our products to select global positioning systembased products instead of products based on competing technologies 

a shut down of us airspace or imposition of restrictions on general aviation would harm our business 

following the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks the faa ordered all aircraft operating in the us to be grounded for several days in addition to this shut down of us airspace the general aviation industry was further impacted by the additional restrictions implemented by the faa on those flights that fly utilizing visual flight rules vfr the faa restricted vfr flight inside 30 enhanced class b a 2025 mile radius around the 30 largest metropolitan areas in the usa airspace areas the aircraft owners and pilots association aopa estimated that these restrictions affected approximately 41800 general aviation aircraft based at 282 airports inside the 30 enhanced class b airspace areas the aopa estimates that approximately 90 of all general aviation flights are conducted vfr and that only 15 of general aviation pilots are current to fly utilizing instrument flight rules ifr 

the shut down of us airspace following september 11 2001 caused reduced sales of our general aviation products and delays in the shipment of our products manufactured in our taiwan manufacturing facility to our distribution facility in olathe kansas thereby adversely affecting our ability to supply new and existing products to our dealers and distributors 

any future shut down of us airspace or imposition of restrictions on general aviation could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results 

  

  

any reallocation of radio frequency spectrum could cause interference with the reception of global positioning system signals this interference could harm our business 

our global positioning system technology is dependent on the use of the standard positioning service sps provided by the us government’s global positioning system satellites the global positioning system operates in radio frequency bands that are globally allocated for radio navigation satellite services the assignment of spectrum is controlled by an international organization known as the international telecommunications union ‘‘itu’’ the federal communications commission ‘‘fcc’’ is responsible for the assignment of spectrum for nongovernment use in the united states in accordance with itu regulations any itu or fcc reallocation of radio frequency spectrum including frequency band segmentation or sharing of spectrum could cause interference with the reception of global positioning system signals and may materially and adversely affect the utility and reliability of our products which would in turn have a material adverse effect on our operating results in addition emissions from mobile satellite service and other equipment operating in adjacent frequency bands or inband may materially and adversely affect the utility and reliability of our products which could result in a material adverse effect on our operating results the fcc continually receives proposals for new technologies and services such as ultrawideband technologies which may seek to operate in or across the radio frequency bands currently used by the gps sps adverse decisions by the fcc that result in harmful interference to the delivery of the gps sps may materially and adversely affect the utility and reliability of our products which could result in a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition 

if we are not successful in the continued development introduction or timely manufacture of new products demand for our products could decrease 

we expect that a significant portion of our future revenue will continue to be derived from sales of newly introduced products the market for our products is characterized by rapidly changing technology evolving industry standards and changes in customer needs if we fail to introduce new products or to modify or improve our existing products in response to changes in technology industry standards or customer needs our products could rapidly become less competitive or obsolete we must continue to make significant investments in research and development in order to continue to develop new products enhance existing products and achieve market acceptance for such products however there can be no assurance that development stage products will be successfully completed or if developed will achieve significant customer acceptance 

if we are unable to successfully develop and introduce competitive new products and enhance our existing products our future results of operations would be adversely affected our pursuit of necessary technology may require substantial time and expense we may need to license new technologies to respond to technological change these licenses may not be available to us on terms that we can accept or may materially change the gross profits that we are able to obtain on our products we may not succeed in adapting our products to new technologies as they emerge development and manufacturing schedules for technology products are difficult to predict and there can be no assurance that we will achieve timely initial customer shipments of new products the timely availability of these products in volume and their acceptance by customers are important to our future success from time to time we have experienced delays in shipping certain of our new products and any future delays whether due to product development delays manufacturing delays lack of market acceptance delays in regulatory approval or otherwise could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

if we do not correctly anticipate demand for our products we may not be able to secure sufficient quantities or costeffective production of our products or we could have costly excess production or inventories 

we have generally been able to increase production to meet this increasing demand however the demand for our products depends on many factors and will be difficult to forecast we expect that it will become more difficult to forecast demand as we introduce and support multiple products as competition in the market for our products intensifies and as the markets for some of our products mature to the mass market category significant unanticipated fluctuations in demand could cause the following problems in our operations 

 

 

 

  

  

 

we may become subject to significant product liability costs 

if our aviation products malfunction or contain errors or defects airplane collisions or crashes could occur resulting in property damage personal injury or death malfunctions or errors or defects in our marine navigational products could cause boats to run aground or cause other wreckage personal injury or death if our automotive or marine products contain defects or errors in the mapping supplied by thirdparty map providers or if our users do not heed our warnings about the proper use of these products collisions or accidents could occur resulting in property damage personal injury or death if any of these events occurs we could be subject to significant liability for personal injury and property damage and under certain circumstances could be subject to a judgment for punitive damages we maintain insurance against accidentrelated risks involving our products however there can be no assurance that such insurance would be sufficient to cover the cost of damages to others or that such insurance will continue to be available at commercially reasonable rates in addition insurance coverage generally will not cover awards of punitive damages and may not cover the cost of associated legal fees and defense costs which could result in lower margins if we are unable to maintain sufficient insurance to cover product liability costs or if our insurance coverage does not cover the award this could have a materially adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we depend on our suppliers some of which are the sole source for specific components and our production would be seriously harmed if these suppliers are not able to meet our demand and alternative sources are not available or if the costs of components rise 

we are dependent on third party suppliers for various components used in our current products some of the components that we procure from third party suppliers include semiconductors and electroluminescent panels liquid crystal displays memory chips batteries and microprocessors the cost quality and availability of components are essential to the successful production and sale of our products some components we use are from sole source suppliers certain applicationspecific integrated circuits incorporating our proprietary designs are manufactured for us by sole source suppliers alternative sources may not be currently available for these sole source components 

in the past we have experienced shortages of liquid crystal displays and other components in addition if there are shortages in supply of components the costs of such components may rise if suppliers are unable to meet our demand for components on a timely basis and if we are unable to obtain an alternative source or if the price of the alternative source is prohibitive or if the costs of components rise our ability to maintain timely and costeffective production of our products would be seriously harmed 

we depend on third party licensors for the digital map data contained in our automotivemobile products and our business andor gross margins could be harmed if we become unable to continue licensing such mapping data or if the royalty costs for such data rise 

we license digital mapping data for use in our products from various sources there are only a limited number of suppliers of mapping data for each geographical region the two largest digital map suppliers are navteq corporation and tele atlas nv navteq corporation is owned by nokia oyj and tele atlas nv is owned by tomtom nv nokia and tomtom are both competitors of garmin 

although we do not foresee difficulty in continuing to license data at favorable pricing due to the long term license extension signed between garmin and navteq in november 2007 extending our navteq license agreement through 2015 with an option to extend through 2019 if we are unable to continue licensing such mapping data and are unable to obtain an alternative source or if the nature of our relationships with navteq changes detrimentally our ability to supply mapping data for use in our products would be seriously harmed 

  

  

we rely on independent dealers and distributors to sell our products and disruption to these channels would harm our business 

because we sell a majority of our products to independent dealers and distributors we are subject to many risks including risks related to their inventory levels and support for our products in particular our dealers and distributors maintain significant levels of our products in their inventories if dealers and distributors attempt to reduce their levels of inventory or if they do not maintain sufficient levels to meet customer demand our sales could be negatively impacted 

many of our dealers and distributors also sell products offered by our competitors if our competitors offer our dealers and distributors more favorable terms those dealers and distributors may deemphasize or decline to carry our products in the future we may not be able to retain or attract a sufficient number of qualified dealers and distributors if we are unable to maintain successful relationships with dealers and distributors or to expand our distribution channels our business will suffer 

failure to manage our growth and expansion effectively could adversely impact our business 

our ability to successfully offer our products and implement our business plan in a rapidly evolving market requires an effective planning and management process we continue to increase the scope of our operations domestically and internationally and have grown our shipments and headcount substantially this growth has placed and our anticipated growth in future operations will continue to place a significant strain on our management systems and resources 

our business may suffer if we are not able to hire and retain sufficient qualified personnel or if we lose our key personnel 

our future success depends partly on the continued contribution of our key executive engineering sales marketing manufacturing and administrative personnel we currently do not have employment agreements with any of our key executive officers we do not have key man life insurance on any of our key executive officers and do not currently intend to obtain such insurance the loss of the services of any of our senior level management or other key employees could harm our business recruiting and retaining the skilled personnel we require to maintain and grow our market position may be difficult for example in some recent years there has been a nationwide shortage of qualified electrical engineers and software engineers who are necessary for us to design and develop new products and therefore it has sometimes been challenging to recruit such personnel if we fail to hire and retain qualified employees we may not be able to maintain and expand our business 

gross margins for our products may fluctuate or erode 

gross margins on our automotivemobile products have been declining due to price reductions in the increasingly competitive market for personal navigation devices pnds we expect that gross margins on automotivemobile products will continue to erode in addition our overall gross margin may fluctuate from period to period due to a number of factors including product mix competition and unit volumes in particular the average selling prices of a specific product tend to decrease over that product’s life to offset such decreases we intend to rely primarily on component cost reduction obtaining yield improvements and corresponding cost reductions in the manufacture of existing products and on introducing new products that incorporate advanced features and therefore can be sold at higher average selling prices however there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain any such yield improvements or cost reductions or introduce any such new products in the future to the extent that such cost reductions and new product introductions do not occur in a timely manner or our products do not achieve market acceptance our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

  

  

our quarterly operating results are subject to fluctuations and seasonality 

our operating results are difficult to predict our future quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly if such operating results decline the price of our stock would likely decline as we expand our operations our operating expenses particularly our advertising and research and development costs may increase as a percentage of our sales if revenues decrease and we are unable to reduce those costs rapidly our operating results would be negatively affected 

historically our revenues have usually been weaker in the first and third quarters of each fiscal year and have from time to time been lower than the preceding quarter our devices are highly consumeroriented and consumer buying is traditionally lower in these quarters sales of certain of our marine and automotive   products tend to be higher in our second fiscal quarter due to increased consumer spending for such products during the recreational marine fishing and travel season sales of our automotivemobile products also have been higher in our fourth fiscal quarter due to increased consumer spending patterns on electronic devices during the holiday season   in addition we attempt to time our new product releases to coincide with relatively higher consumer spending in the second and fourth fiscal quarters which contributes to these seasonal variations 

 

adverse economic conditions may harm our investments 

inflation or other changes in general economic conditions could adversely affect our investment portfolio 

 

our quarterly financial statements will reflect fluctuations in foreign currency translation 

our taiwan subsidiary holds and is expected to continue to hold significant cash cash equivalents and marketable securities and receivables denominated in us dollars because the us dollar is the primary currency for our business and in order to substantially reduce the economic consequence of any variation in the exchange rate for the us dollar and the taiwan dollar on these assets management expects that the taiwan subsidiary will continue to hold the majority of these assets in us dollar or us dollar denominated instruments nonetheless us gaap requires the company at the end of each accounting period to translate into taiwan dollars all such us dollar denominated assets held by our taiwan subsidiary this translation is required because the taiwan dollar is the functional currency of the subsidiary this us gaapmandated translation will cause us to recognize gain or loss on our financial statements as the taiwan dollarus dollar exchange rate varies such gain or loss will create variations in our earnings per share because there is minimal cash impact caused by such exchange rate variations management will continue to focus on the company’s operating performance before the impact of the foreign currency translation 

if we are unable to compete effectively with existing or new competitors our resulting loss of competitive position could result in price reductions fewer customer orders reduced margins and loss of market share 

the markets for our products are highly competitive and we expect competition to increase in the future some of our competitors have significantly greater financial technical and marketing resources than we do these competitors may be able to respond more rapidly to new or emerging technologies or changes in customer requirements they may also be able to devote greater resources to the development promotion and sale of their products increased competition could result in price reductions fewer customer orders reduced margins and loss of market share our failure to compete successfully against current or future competitors could seriously harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

  

our intellectual property rights are important to our operations and we could suffer loss if they infringe upon other’s rights or are infringed upon by others 

we rely on a combination of patents copyrights trademarks and trade secrets confidentiality provisions and licensing arrangements to establish and protect our proprietary rights to this end we hold rights to a number of patents and registered trademarks and regularly file applications to attempt to protect our rights in new technology and trademarks however there is no guarantee that our patent applications will become issued patents or that our trademark applications will become registered trademarks moreover even if approved our patents or trademarks may thereafter be successfully challenged by others or otherwise become invalidated for a variety of reasons thus any patents or trademarks we currently have or may later acquire may not provide us a significant competitive advantage 

third parties may claim that we are infringing their intellectual property rights such claims could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition from time to time we receive letters alleging infringement of patents trademarks or other intellectual property rights litigation concerning patents or other intellectual property is costly and time consuming we may seek licenses from such parties but they could refuse to grant us a license or demand commercially unreasonable terms we might not have sufficient resources to pay for the licenses such infringement claims could also cause us to incur substantial liabilities and to suspend or permanently cease the use of critical technologies or processes or the production or sale of major products 

failure to obtain required certifications of our products on a timely basis could harm our business 

we have certain products especially in our aviation segment that are subject to governmental and similar certifications before they can be sold for example faa certification is required for all of our aviation products that are intended for installation in type certificated aircraft to the extent required certification is an expensive and timeconsuming process that requires significant focus and resources an inability to obtain or excessive delay in obtaining such certifications could have an adverse effect on our ability to introduce new products and for certain aviation oem products our customers’ ability to sell airplanes therefore such inabilities or delays could adversely affect our operating results   in addition we cannot assure you that our certified products will not be decertified any such decertification could have an adverse effect on our operating results 

our business is subject to economic political and other risks associated with international sales and operations 

our business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally we estimate that approximately 39 of our net sales in the fiscal year ended december 27 2008 represented products shipped to international destinations accordingly our business financial condition and results of operations could be harmed by a variety of international factors including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we may experience unique economic and political risks associated with companies that operate in taiwan 

relations between taiwan and the people’s republic of china also referred to as the prc and other factors affecting the political or economic conditions of taiwan in the future could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations and the market price and the liquidity of our shares our principal manufacturing facilities where we manufacture all of our products except our panelmounted aviation products are located in taiwan 

  

  

taiwan has a unique international political status the prc asserts sovereignty over all of china including taiwan certain other islands and all of mainland china the prc government does not recognize the legitimacy of the taiwan government although significant economic and cultural relations have been established during recent years between taiwan and the prc the prc government has indicated that it may use military force to gain control over taiwan in certain circumstances such as the declaration of independence by taiwan relations between taiwan and the prc have on occasion adversely affected the market value of taiwanese companies and could negatively affect our operations in taiwan in the future 

there is uncertainty as to our shareholders’ ability to enforce certain foreign civil liabilities in the cayman islands and taiwan 

we are a cayman islands company and a substantial portion of our assets are located outside the united states particularly in taiwan as a result it may be difficult to effect service of process within the united states upon us in addition there is uncertainty as to whether the courts of the cayman islands or taiwan would recognize or enforce judgments of united states courts obtained against us predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the united states or any state thereof or be competent to hear original actions brought in the cayman islands or taiwan against us predicated upon the securities laws of the united states or any state thereof 

our shareholders may face difficulties in protecting their interests because we are incorporated under cayman islands law 

our corporate affairs are governed by our memorandum and articles of association as amended and by the companies law 2007 revision and the common law of the cayman islands the rights of our shareholders and the fiduciary responsibilities of our directors under cayman islands law are not as clearly established as under statutes or judicial precedent in existence in jurisdictions in the united states therefore you may have more difficulty in protecting your interests in the face of actions by the management directors or our controlling shareholders than would shareholders of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction in the united states due to the comparatively less developed nature of cayman islands law in this area 

unlike many jurisdictions in the united states cayman islands law does not specifically provide for shareholder appraisal rights on a merger or consolidation of a company this may make it more difficult for you to assess the value of any consideration you may receive in a merger or consolidation or to require that the offeror give you additional consideration if you believe the consideration offered is insufficient 

shareholders of cayman islands exempted companies such as garmin have no general rights under cayman islands law to inspect corporate records and accounts or to obtain copies of lists of shareholders of the company this may make it more difficult for you to obtain the information needed to establish any facts necessary for a shareholder motion or to solicit proxies from other shareholders in connection with a proxy contest 

subject to limited exceptions under cayman islands law a minority shareholder may not bring a derivative action against the board of directors our cayman islands counsel has advised that they are not aware of any reported class action or derivative action having been brought in a cayman islands court 

we may pursue strategic acquisitions investments strategic partnerships or other ventures and our business could be materially harmed if we fail to successfully identify complete and integrate such transactions 

we intend to evaluate acquisition opportunities and opportunities to make investments in complementary businesses technologies services or products or to enter into strategic partnerships with parties who can provide access to those assets additional product or services offerings additional distribution or marketing synergies or additional industry expertise in 2008 we acquired our distributors in austria belgium denmark finland portugal and sweden to strengthen its presence and capabilities in the european market we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition investment or strategic partnership candidates or if we do identify suitable candidates in the future we may not be able to complete those transactions on commercially favorable terms or at all 

  

  

any past or future acquisitions could also result in difficulties assimilating acquired employees including cultural differences with foreign acquisitions operations and products and diversion of capital and management’s attention away from other business issues and opportunities integration of acquired companies may result in problems related to integration of technology and inexperienced management teams in addition the key personnel of the acquired company may decide not to work for us our management has had limited experience in assimilating acquired organizations and products into our operations we may not successfully integrate internal controls compliance under the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 and other corporate governance matters operations personnel or products related to acquisitions we made in 2008 or may make in the future if we fail to successfully integrate such transactions our business could be materially harmed 

we have benefited in the past from taiwan government tax incentives offered on certain high technology capital investments that may not always be available 

our effective tax rate is lower than the us federal statutory rate because we have benefited from incentives offered in taiwan related to our high technology investments in taiwan the loss of these tax benefits could have a significant effect on our financial results in the future 

changes in our united states federal income tax classification or in applicable tax law could result in adverse tax consequences to our shareholders 

we do not believe that we or any of our nonunited states subsidiaries are currently a ‘‘passive foreign investment company’’ for united states federal income tax purposes we do not expect to become a passive foreign investment company however because the passive foreign investment company determination is made annually based on whether the company’s income or assets meet certain thresholds as determined under united states federal tax principles which are based on facts and circumstances that may be beyond our control we cannot assure that we will not become a passive foreign investment company in the future if we are a passive foreign investment company in any year then any of our shareholders that is a united states person could be liable to pay tax on their pro rata share of our income plus an interest charge upon some distributions by us or when that shareholder sells our common shares at a gain further if we are classified as a passive foreign investment company in any year in which a united states person is a shareholder we generally will continue to be treated as a passive foreign investment company with respect to such shareholder in all succeeding years regardless of whether we continue to satisfy the income or asset tests mentioned above 

 

we do not believe that we or any of our nonunited states subsidiaries are currently a controlled foreign corporation cfc for united states federal income tax purposes we do not expect to become a cfc the cfc determination is made daily based on whether the united states shareholders own more than fifty percent of the voting power or value of the company only united states persons that own ten percent or more of the voting power of the company’s shares qualify as united states shareholders if the company were to be classified as a cfc for an uninterrupted thirty day period in any year the company’s shareholders that qualify as united states shareholders could be liable to pay us income tax at ordinary income tax rates on their prorata share of certain categories of the company’s income for the period in which the company is classified as a cfc as the company cannot control the ownership of the company’s stock nor can the company control which shareholders participate in the company’s stock buyback program ownership changes could result that create united states shareholders which increase the risk of garmin being treated as a cfc 

we may have additional tax liabilities   

we are subject to income taxes in both the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes in the ordinary course of our business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain we are regularly under audit by tax authorities although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals the results of an audit or litigation could have a material effect on our income tax provision net income or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made 

  

  

risks relating to our shares 

 

the volatility of our stock price could adversely affect investment in our common shares 

the market price of our common shares has been and may continue to be highly volatile during 2008 the price of our common shares ranged from a low of 1440 to a high of 9558 a variety of factors could cause the price of our common shares to fluctuate perhaps substantially including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in addition in recent years the stock market in general and the markets for shares of technology companies in particular have experienced extreme price fluctuations which have often been unrelated to the operating performance of affected companies any such fluctuations in the future could adversely affect the market price of our common shares and the market price of our common shares may decline 

 

our officers and directors exert substantial influence over us 

as of february 4 2009 members and former members of our board of directors and our executive officers together with members of their families and entities that may be deemed affiliates of or related to such persons or entities beneficially owned approximately 437 of our outstanding common shares accordingly these shareholders may be able to determine the outcome of corporate actions requiring shareholder approval such as mergers and acquisitions this level of ownership may have a significant effect in delaying deferring or preventing a change in control of garmin and may adversely affect the voting and other rights of other holders of our common shares 

provisions in our shareholder rights plan and our charter documents might deter delay or prevent a third party from acquiring us and cayman islands corporate law may impede a takeover which could decrease the value of our shares 

our board of directors has the authority to issue up to 1000000 preferred shares and to determine the price rights preferences privileges and restrictions including voting rights of those shares without any further vote or action by the shareholders this could have an adverse impact on the market price of our common shares we have no present plans to issue any preferred shares but we may do so the rights of the holders of common shares may be subject to and adversely affected by the rights of the holders of any preferred shares that may be issued in the future in addition we have adopted a classified board of directors our shareholders are unable to remove any director or the entire board of directors without a super majority vote in addition a super majority vote is required to approve transactions with interested shareholders shareholders do not have the right to call a shareholders meeting we have adopted a shareholders’ rights plan which under certain circumstances would significantly impair the ability of third parties to acquire control of us without prior approval of our board of directors this shareholders’ rights plan and the provisions in our charter documents could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us even if doing so would benefit our shareholders 

  

  

unlike many jurisdictions in the united states cayman islands law does not currently provide for mergers as that expression is understood under corporate law in the united states while cayman islands law does have statutory provisions that provide for the reconstruction and amalgamation of companies which are commonly referred to in the cayman islands as a “scheme of arrangement” the procedural and legal requirements necessary to consummate these transactions are more rigorous and take longer to complete than the procedures typically required to consummate a merger in the united states under cayman islands law and practice a scheme of arrangement in relation to a solvent cayman islands exempted company must be approved at a shareholders’ meeting by a majority of the company’s shareholders who are present and voting either in person or by proxy at such meeting the shares voted in favor of the scheme of arrangement must also represent at least 75 of the value of each class of the company’s shareholders excluding the shares owned by the parties to the scheme of arrangement present and voting at the meeting the grand court of the cayman islands must also sanction the convening of these meetings and the terms of the amalgamation although there is no requirement to seek the consent of the creditors of the parties involved in the scheme of arrangement the grand court typically seeks to ensure that the creditors have consented to the transfer of their liabilities to the surviving entity or that the scheme of arrangement does not otherwise materially adversely affect the creditors’ interests furthermore the grand court will only approve a scheme of arrangement if it is satisfied that 

 

 

 

 

there are proposals to amend the companies law to permit companies to merge in a manner broadly similar to the mergers provisions in the state of delaware those proposals were released by the cayman islands government for comment on january 20 2009 although the period for comments has now expired a final draft bill has not been released and therefore it is not possible to specify the final form of the proposals or an anticipated date for such legislation to be adopted

overview 

 

we are a leading worldwide provider of navigation communications and information devices most of which are enabled by global positioning system or gps technology we operate in four business segments which serve the marine outdoorfitness automotivemobile and aviation markets our segments offer products through our network of subsidiary distributors and independent dealers and distributors however the nature of products and types of customers for the four segments can vary significantly as such the segments are managed separately our portable gps receivers and accessories for marine recreationfitness and automotivemobile segments are sold primarily to retail outlets our aviation products are portable and panelmount avionics for visual flight rules and instrument flight rules navigation and are sold primarily to retail outlets and certain aircraft manufacturers 

since our first products were delivered in 1991 we have generated positive income from operations each year and have funded our growth from these profits our sales have increased at a compounded annual growth rate of 46 since 2004 and our net income has increased at a compounded annual growth rate of 37 since 2004 the vast majority of this growth has been organic only a very small amount of new revenue occurred as a result of the acquisition of motionbased technologies llc in 2005 dynastream innovations inc in 2006 digital cyclone inc and the assets of nautamatic marine systems inc in 2007 and ten european distributors in 2007 and 2008 these acquisitions had no significant impact on net income for those years 

since our principal locations are in the united states taiwan and the uk we experience some foreign currency fluctuations in our operating results the functional currency of our european operations is the euro effective july 2007 and the functional currency of garmin corporation headquartered in taiwan is the taiwan dollar approximately 76 of sales by our european subsidiaries are now denominated in british pounds sterling or the euro we experienced 353 million 230 million 06 million 153 million and 248 million in foreign currency gains losses during fiscal years 2008 2007 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively the 2008 foreign currency loss includes a realized gain of 215 million due to the strengthening of the euro between the date we purchased shares in tele atlas nv in october 2007 and the tender of shares in february march and june 2008 to date we have not entered into hedging transactions with the euro the british pound sterling or the taiwan dollar and we do not currently plan to utilize hedging transactions in the future 

  

  

critical accounting policies and estimates 

 

general 

 

garmin’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon garmin’s consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the presentation of these financial statements requires garmin to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis garmin evaluates its estimates including those related to customer sales programs and incentives product returns bad debts inventories investments intangible assets income taxes warranty obligations and contingencies and litigation garmin bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

revenue recognition 

 

garmin records estimated reductions to revenue for customer sales programs returns and incentive offerings including rebates price protection product discounts offered to retailers to assist in clearing older products from their inventories in advance of new product releases promotions and other volumebased incentives the reductions to revenue are based on estimates and judgments using historical experience and expectation of future conditions changes in these estimates could negatively affect garmin’s operating results these incentives are reviewed periodically and with the exceptions of price protection and certain other promotions are accrued for on a percentage of sales basis if market conditions were to decline garmin may take actions to increase customer incentive offerings possibly resulting in an incremental reduction of revenue at the time the incentive is offered 

 

trade accounts receivable 

we sell our products to retailers wholesalers and other customers and extend credit based on our evaluation of the customer’s financial condition potential losses on receivables are dependent on each individual customer’s financial condition we carry our trade accounts receivable at net realizable value typically our accounts receivable are collected within 60 days and do not bear interest we monitor our exposure to losses on receivables and maintain allowances for potential losses or adjustments we determine these allowances by 1 evaluating the aging of our receivables and 2 reviewing our highrisk customers past due receivable balances are written off when our internal collection efforts have been unsuccessful in collecting the amount due 

 

warranties 

 

garmin’s products sold are generally covered by a warranty for periods ranging from one to two years garmin accrues a warranty reserve for estimated costs to provide warranty services garmin’s estimate of costs to service its warranty obligations is based on historical experience and expectation of future conditions to the extent garmin experiences increased warranty claim activity or increased costs associated with servicing those claims its warranty accrual will increase resulting in decreased gross profit 

inventory 

 

garmin writes down its inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management additional inventory writedowns may be required 

  

  

investments 

investments are classified as available for sale and recorded at fair value and unrealized investment gains and losses are reflected in stockholders’ equity investment income is recorded when earned and capital gains and losses are recognized when investments are sold fair value of investments in auction rate securities are valued using third party estimates which followed an income approach valuation methodology investments are reviewed periodically to determine if they have suffered an impairment of value that is considered other than temporary if investments are determined to be impaired a capital loss is recognized at the date of determination 

testing for impairment of investments also requires significant management judgment the identification of potentially impaired investments the determination of their fair value and the assessment of whether any decline in value is other than temporary are the key judgment elements the discovery of new information and the passage of time can significantly change these judgments revisions of impairment judgments are made when new information becomes known and any resulting impairment adjustments are made at that time the economic environment and volatility of securities markets increase the difficulty of determining fair value and assessing investment impairment 

income taxes 

 

garmin provides deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the difference between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their carrying amount for financial reporting purposes as measured by the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse while no valuation allowance has been recorded it is garmin’s policy to record a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to an amount that it believes is more likely than not to be realized while garmin has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance in the event garmin were to determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax assets in the future an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such determination is made likewise should garmin determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase income in the period such determination is made 

in addition the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations we recognize liabilities for tax audit issues in the us and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes will be due if payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary if our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment a further charge to expense would result 

stock based compensation 

garmin awards stock options stock appreciation rights “sars” restricted stock units “rsus” andor performance shares each year as part of garmin’s compensation package for employees employees with certain levels of responsibility within garmin are eligible for stock options sar grants rsu grants andor performance shares but the granting of options sars rsus andor performance shares is at the discretion of the compensation committee of the board of directors and is not a contractual obligation stock compensation plans are discussed in detail in note 9 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

  

  

accounting terms and characteristics 

net sales 

our net sales are primarily generated through sales to our global dealer and distributor network and to original equipment manufacturers the company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists delivery has occurred the sales price is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured product is considered delivered to the customer once it has been shipped and title and risk of loss have been transferred for most of the company’s product sales these criteria are met at the time the product is delivered to the customer’s location the company assumes no remaining significant obligations associated with the product sale other than that related to its warranty programs discussed below our sales are largely of a consumer nature therefore backlog levels are not necessarily indicative of our future sales results we aim to achieve a quick turnaround on orders we receive and we typically ship most orders within 72 hours 

net sales are subject to seasonal fluctuation typically sales of our consumer products are highest in the second quarter due to increased demand during the spring and summer season and in the fourth quarter due to increased demand during the holiday buying season our aviation products do not experience much seasonal variation but are more influenced by the timing of the release of new products when the initial demand is typically the strongest 

gross profit 

 

raw material costs are our most significant component of cost of goods sold in 2008 gross margin for our automotivemobile segment declined 310 basis points as the average selling price continued to decline and we experienced further shift in product mix to lowermargin product groups these impacts were somewhat offset by raw material price declines most significantly flash memory in the first half of 2007 we experienced favorable product mix and product pricing which allowed us to hold margins in our automotivemobile segment steady margin declines in the second half of 2007 were primarily a result of average selling price declines coupled with raw materials price increases most notably the costs for flash memory in late second quarter and through the third quarter of 2007 when we were purchasing these components for our holiday production runs resulting in margin declines as these components were sold primarily in the fourth quarter of 2007 in the first half of 2006 we experienced meaningful price declines on flash memory and color screens which allowed us to hold margins in our automotivemobile segment steady in the face of price declines and allowed us to improve margins in other business segments as well while these price declines did not continue throughout all of 2006 we did have additional component cost reductions as we neared year end that offset a shift in product mix to lowermargin product groups gross margins for the aviation marine and outdoorfitness segments are more stable our longterm gross margin targets are 65 55 and 55 respectively for these segments 

our existing practice of performing the design and manufacture of our products inhouse has enabled us to utilize alternative lower cost components from different suppliers and where possible to redesign our products to permit us to use these lower cost components we believe that because of our practice of performing the design manufacture and marketing of our products inhouse our shijr jhongli and linkou manufacturing plants in taiwan our olathe kansas and salem oregon manufacturing plants have experienced relatively low costs of manufacturing in general products manufactured in taiwan have been our highest volume products our manufacturing labor costs historically have been lower in taiwan than in olathe and salem 

sales price variability has had and can be expected to have an effect on our gross profit in the past prices of our devices sold into the automotivemobile market have declined due to market pressures and introduction of new products sold at lower price points the average selling prices of our aviation products have increased due to product mix and the introduction of more advanced products sold at higher prices the effect of the sales price differences inherent within the mix of gpsenabled products sold could have a significant impact on our gross profit 

  

  

selling general and administrative expenses 

our selling general and administrative expenses consist primarily of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as revenues have grown selling general and administrative expenses have also increased during the past five years due to the economic pressure on our consumeroriented business we plan to decrease selling general and administrative expenses in 2009 we expect to decrease advertising and marketing expenses to better match anticipated demand and to support operating margins we also reduced advertising and marketing expenses in the second half of 2008 and did not experience a negative impact to our market share we also expect selling general and administrative costs excluding advertising to be flat in 2009 

 

research and development 

the majority of our research and development costs represent salaries for our engineers costs for high technology components and costs of test equipment used in product and prototype development approximately 86 of the research and development of our products is performed in north america the remainder of our research and development activities are performed by our taiwan engineering group which has increased in size in recent years 

we are committed to increasing the level of innovative design and development of new products as we strive for expanded ability to serve our existing consumer and aviation markets as well as new markets for gpsenabled devices we continue to grow our research and development budget in absolute terms 

 

customers 

 

best buy accounted for 120 of our net sales in the year ended december 27 2008 our top ten customers have contributed between 24 and 43 of net sales since 2004 we have experienced average sales days in our customer accounts receivable of between 43 and 70 days since 2004 we have experienced an increase in the level of customer accounts receivable days due to changes in product mix longer payment terms and macroeconomic conditions we expect to reduce the level of customer accounts receivable days as we negotiate shorter payment terms with our customers in 2008 one of our key customers circuit city filed for bankruptcy resulting in an increase of 185 million in accounts receivable reserve 

 

 

income taxes 

 

we have experienced a relatively low effective corporate tax rate due to the proportion of our revenue generated by entities in tax jurisdictions with low statutory rates in particular the profit entitlement afforded our parent company based on its intellectual property rights ownership of our consumer products along with substantial tax incentives offered by the taiwanese government on certain hightechnology capital investments have continued to reduce our tax rate as a result our consolidated effective tax rate was approximately 199 during 2008 this is an increase from 126 during 2007 due to a change in tax law related to the repatriation of earnings from our taiwan subsidiary and a more unfavorable mix of taxable income among the tax jurisdictions in which the company operates we have taken advantage of the tax benefit in taiwan since our inception and we expect to continue to benefit from lower effective tax rates at least through 2013 we plan on applying for additional incentives for years beyond 2013 based on capital investments we expect to make in the future however there can be no assurance that such tax incentives will be available indefinitely or that we will receive the incentives for which we apply management believes that due to lower operating margins predicted for fiscal 2009 there may be slightly less revenue recognized by entities in lower tax rate jurisdictions therefore the effective tax rate for fiscal 2009 is expected to be slightly higher than fiscal 2008 the actual effective tax rate will be dependent upon the operating margins production volume additional capital investments made during fiscal 2009 and the composition of our earnings

comparison of 52weeks ended december 27 2008 and december 29 2007 

net sales 

 

 

the increase in total net sales for 2008 was primarily driven by outdoorfitness automotivemobile and aviation product offerings automotivemobile revenue remains a significantly larger portion of our revenue mix decreasing slightly from 736 in 2007 to 726 in 2008 total unit sales increased 38 to 169 million in 2008 from 123 million in 2007 the higher unit sales volume in 2008 was primarily attributable to strong sales of automotive products particularly in north america and outdoorfitness products in general management believes that continuous innovation and the introduction of new products are essential for future revenue growth 

automotivemobile segment revenue grew 84 in 2008 on the strength of the nuvi ® series of personal navigation devices pnds as well as increased consumer awareness of the capabilities and applications of gps on a percentage basis revenues in our outdoorfitness segment grew faster than any other segment from the year ago period due to the introduction of the colorado™ series the oregon ™ series the forerunner ® 405 and edge ® 705 which offer enhanced form factors and cartography our aviation segment continued to grow on the strength of our g1000 cockpit as an oem original equipment manufacturer solution this growth slowed significantly in the second half of 2008 as the macroeconomic conditions influenced purchasing decisions and slowed oem production schedules marine revenues were slightly higher than the prior year due to strong growth in the first quarter of 2008 offset by flat to declining revenue in the remainder of the year due to macroeconomic conditions and fuel prices 

the company anticipates that the macroeconomic conditions will dampen or eliminate revenue growth in 2009 across all segments 

gross profit 

 

 

the increase in gross profit dollars was primarily attributable to the outdoorfitness and aviation segments where revenue growth and consistent margins contributed gross profit margin percentage for the company overall decreased 150 basis points as a result of the automotivemobile segment decline of 310 basis points offset to some extent by strong gross margins in our other three segments the automotivemobile segment is by nature a lowermargin business and the company has begun to see the impacts expected on gross margin due to falling prices and a product mix shift toward lower end pnds management believes that the trend to lower gross margins for this segment will continue due to ongoing price declines and further product mix shift toward lower margin products outdoorfitness gross margin has increased due to a newer suite of products a product mix favoring the high margin g1000 in the aviation segment resulted in favorable gross margins for the aviation segment in 2008 marine gross margin remained relatively stable and within historic ranges 

 

  

  

selling general and administrative expenses 

 

 

the increase in selling general and administrative expense was driven primarily by costs associated with the european distributors acquired in 2007 and 2008 increased staffing to support our growth and bad debt expense selling general and administrative expenses excluding advertising increased by 877 million in 2008 due to the acquired european distributors information technology call center operations and other administrative areas to support the growth of our businesses as well as bad debt expense due to the bankruptcy of circuit city we expect selling general and administrative expenses excluding advertising to be flat in 2009 further bankruptcies among our customer base or inability to pay timely could result in increased bad debt expense in 2009 advertising expenses increased by 12 million on a yearoveryear basis as we reduced activities during the second half of the year due to moderating growth associated with the macroeconomic pressures management expects to continue to reduce advertising costs in 2009 to better match anticipated demand and to support operating margins 

research and development expense 

 

 

the increase in research and development expense dollars was due to ongoing development activities for new products the addition of 350 new engineering personnel to our staff during the period and an increase in engineering program costs in 2008 as a result of our continued emphasis on product innovation management believes that one of the key strategic initiatives for future growth and success of garmin is continuous innovation development and introduction of new products management expects that its research and development expenses will increase approximately 1015 during fiscal 2009 on an absolute dollar basis due to the anticipated introduction of a strong portfolio of new products slated for fiscal 2009 management expects to continue to invest in the research and development of new products and technology in order to maintain garmin’s competitive advantage in the markets in which it competes 

 

other income expense 

 

 

 

other income expense principally consists of interest income interest expense and foreign currency exchange gains and losses other income expense was lower in fiscal 2008 relative to fiscal 2007 with the majority of this difference caused by a large foreign currency loss in 2008 interest income for fiscal 2008 decreased due to lower interest rates and a decline in our cash and marketable securities balances during the year 

 

 

foreign currency gains and losses for the company are primarily tied to movements by the taiwan dollar  the euro and the british pound sterling the us dollar remains the functional currency of garmin europe ltd the euro is the functional currency of all other european subsidiaries excluding garmin danmark and garmin sweden as these entities have grown euro currency moves generated material gains and losses additionally eurobased intercompany transactions in garmin ltd can also generate currency gains and losses the canadian dollar danish krone swedish krona and australian dollar are the functional currency of dynastream innovations inc garmin danmark garmin sweden and garmin australasia respectively due to these entities’ relative size currency moves are not expected to have a material impact on the company’s financial statements 

the 353 million currency loss in 2008 was related to the strengthening of the us dollar offset by a gain associated with the sales and tender of our tele atlas nv shares during 2008 the taiwan dollar weakened 16 in comparison to the us dollar resulting in a 208 million gain the euro weakened 41 and the british pound sterling weakened 261 relative to the us dollar in 2008 which resulted in a 773 million loss the relative weakness of the taiwan dollar and eurobritish pound sterling have offsetting impacts due to the use of the taiwan dollar for manufacturing costs while the euro and british pound sterling transactions relate to revenue offsetting this net loss was a realized gain of 215 million due to the strengthening of the euro between the date of purchase of the tele atlas nv shares in october 2007 to the dates of tender in february march and june 2008 other net currency losses and the timing of transactions created the remaining loss of 03 million 

the majority of the 230 million currency gain in fiscal 2007 was due to the weakening of the us dollar compared to the euro and the british pound sterling during fiscal 2007 the taiwan dollar strengthened relative to the us dollar resulting in a 25 million loss the british pound sterling and the euro strengthened 2 and 114 respectively relative to the us dollar during fiscal 2007 which resulted in a 256 million gain other net currency gains and the timing of transactions created the remaining loss of 01 million 

other income of 509 million in 2008 was primarily generated from the sale of our equity interest in tele atlas nv which we acquired in 2007 in connection with our announced intent to make a cash offer for all outstanding shares which was subsequently abandoned 

income tax provision 

our earnings before taxes fell 65 when compared to 2007 yet our income tax expense increased by 582 million to 1815 million for fiscal year 2008 from 1233 million for fiscal year 2007 due to a higher effective tax rate the effective tax rate was 199 for fiscal 2008 compared to 126 for fiscal 2007 the increase in tax rate is due to a change in tax law related to the repatriation of earnings from our taiwan subsidiary and the unfavorable mix of taxable income among the tax jurisdictions in which the company operates 

net income 

as a result of the various factors noted above net income decreased 14 to 7328 million for fiscal year 2008 compared to 8550 million for fiscal year 2007 

 

 

comparison of fiscal years ended december 27 2007 and december 30 2006 

net sales 

 

 

the increase in total net sales during fiscal 2007 was primarily due to the introduction of over 60 new products and overall demand for our automotive products the aviation marine and outdoorfitness segments also experienced solid growth in 2007 total units sold increased 128 to 123 million in 2007 from 54 million in 2006 

the increase in net sales to consumers was primarily due to the introduction of many new automotive outdoorfitness and marine products strong demand for our automotive products and solid demand for our aviation marine and outdoorfitness products it is management’s belief that the continued demand for the company’s automotive products is due to overall increased consumer awareness of the capabilities and applications of gps particularly as those capabilities pertain to automobile navigation additionally the expansion of the gps market in general as well as enhanced feature sets in our products specifically has added to our growth innovative new product offerings enhanced cartography rich feature sets and products featuring high sensitivity gps capabilities increased sales of our marine and outdoor fitness segments the increase in aviation sales for fiscal 2007 was primarily due to increased sales from panel mount products sold into the oem original equipment manufacturers and retrofit markets sales of the g1000 integrated glass cockpit were the primary reason for increased oem sales in 2006 while temporary flight restrictions tfrs continue to impact general aviation the flying community is adapting to these changes and returning to the skies in greater numbers 

 

gross profit 

 

 

the increase in gross profit dollars was primarily attributable to the introduction of over 60 new products and strong demand for our automotive and outdoorfitness products the reduction in gross margin percentage was primarily due to the strong growth experienced in our lowermargin automotivemobile product line offset to some extent by strong gross margins in our other three segments notably gross margin in our automotivemobile segment did not fall as much as anticipated due to volume discounts on certain components less price competition than anticipated and new “premium” featurerich products with higher selling prices and margins the rise in aviation gross margin was primarily due to a shift in product mix within our oem and retrofit products the decline in gross margin in the outdoorfitness and marine segments was primarily due to a shift in product mix 

 

 

selling general and administrative expenses 

 

 

the increase in expense was primarily attributable to increases in employment generally across the organization significantly increased advertising costs up 80 associated primarily with massmarket advertising to increase brand awareness and promote our automotive products increased information technology staffing and support costs increased staffing in our sales and marketing group to increase focus on specific target markets and additional staffing in our customer call center 

research and development expenses 

 

 

the increase in research and development expense was primarily attributable to the addition of over 400 associates to our research and development team during fiscal 2007 a key strategic initiative for future growth and success of garmin is continuous innovation development and introduction of new products which was facilitated by these additions to research and development staff 

other income expense 

 

 

other income expense principally consists of interest income interest expense and foreign currency exchange gains and losses other income expense was higher in fiscal 2007 relative to fiscal 2006 with the majority of this difference caused by increased interest income and a large foreign currency gain in 2007 interest income for fiscal 2007 increased due to higher interest rates and larger cash and marketable securities balances during the year increasing the returns on the company’s cash and cash equivalents 

foreign currency gains and losses for the company in 2007 were primarily tied to movements by the taiwan dollar the euro and the british pound sterling the us dollar remains the functional currency of garmin europe ltd the euro dollar is the functional currency of garmin france garmin deutschland garmin iberia and garmin italia as these entities grow euro currency moves will generate material gains and losses additionally eurobased intercompany transactions between garmin ltd and its subsidiaries can also generate currency gains and losses the canadian dollar is the functional currency of dynastream innovations inc due to this entity’s relative size its currency moves do not have a material impact on the company’s financial statements 

 

 

the majority of the 230 million currency gain in fiscal 2007 was due to the weakening of the us dollar compared to the euro and the british pound sterling during fiscal 2007 the taiwan dollar weakened relative to the us dollar resulting in a 25 million loss the british pound sterling and the euro strengthened 2 and 114 respectively relative to the us dollar during fiscal 2007 which resulted in a 256 million gain other net currency gains and the timing of transactions created the remaining loss of 01 million 

foreign currency gains and losses for the company in 2006 were primarily tied to movements by the taiwan dollar and the british pound sterling relative to the us dollar the us dollar weakened when compared to the taiwan dollar during fiscal 2006 creating a 30 million loss which was offset almost entirely by a 45 million gain as a result of strengthening in the us dollar relative to the british pound sterling other net currency gains and the timing of transactions created the remaining loss of 09 million 

 

income tax provision 

income tax expense increased by 429 million to 1233 million for fiscal year 2007 from 804 million for fiscal year 2006 due to our higher taxable income the effective tax rate was 126 for fiscal 2007 versus 135 for fiscal 2006 the decrease in tax rate is due to additional tax benefits received from taiwan as a result of our continued capital investment in our manufacturing facilities in taiwan tax credits resulting from our decision to repatriate certain of our taiwan earnings to our parent company and the increased contribution to our income from lower tax jurisdictions during 2007 relative to 2006 this lower effective tax rate resulted in a decrease in the ratio of income tax as a percentage of revenue of approximately 07 from fiscal 2006 to fiscal 2007 

 

net income 

as a result of the various factors noted above net income increased 66 to 8550 million for fiscal year 2007 compared to 5141 million for fiscal year 2006 

 

liquidity and capital resources 

net cash generated by operations was 8622 million 6821 million and 3619 million for fiscal years 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively we experienced reductions in both accounts receivable and inventories that contributed to cash generated by operations in 2008 accounts payable also decreased representing a use of cash we are focused on reducing accounts receivable days outstanding as we negotiate shorter payment terms with our customers with regard to inventory we operate with a customeroriented approach and seek to maintain sufficient inventory to meet customer demand because we desire to respond quickly to our customers and minimize order fulfillment time our inventory levels are generally substantial enough to meet most demand we also attempt to carry sufficient inventory levels of key components so that potential supplier shortages have as minimal an impact as possible on our ability to deliver our finished products we do plan to further reduce inventory levels in 2009 in response to slowing consumer demand 

capital expenditures in 2008 totaled 1196 million a decrease of 372 million from fiscal 2007 this amount in 2008 reflects the buildout of additional manufacturing lines in linkou taiwan completion of our expanded north american distribution facility and maintenance activities capital expenditures in 2007 totaled 1568 million an increase of 639 million from fiscal 2006 this amount in 2007 reflects the purchase and buildout of an additional manufacturing facility in linkou taiwan continued expansion of research and development facilities in our taiwan facilities as well as ordinary capital expenditures for fiscal 2007 capital expenditures in 2006 totaled 929 million an increase of 658 million from fiscal 2005 this amount in 2006 reflects the purchase and renovation of an additional manufacturing facility in jhongli taiwan the purchase of a new european headquarters in the united kingdom as well as ordinary capital expenditures for fiscal 2006 

we have budgeted approximately 60 million of capital expenditures during fiscal 2009 to include normal ongoing capital expenditures as well as completion of the aviation manufacturing expansion in olathe kansas

net cash used by financing activities during 2008 was 8081 million resulting from the use of 6718 million for the stock repurchases and 1503 million for the payment of a dividend offset by 140 million from the issuance of common shares related to the exercise of employee stock options and stock appreciation rights and the related tax benefit the 6718 million of share repurchases represents 171 million common shares refer to “item 5 market for the company’s common shares related shareholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities” for additional discussion regarding the 2008 share repurchase programs   cash flow related to financing activities resulted in a net use of cash in 2007 of 1361 million during 2007 garmin repurchased 57235 of its common shares under the 3000000share stock repurchase program that was approved by the board of directors on august 3 2006 and expired on december 31 2007 sources and uses in financing activities during 2007 related primarily to a use for the payment of a dividend 1625 million and the purchase of stock 78 million and a source of cash from the issuance of common shares related to the exercise of employee stock options and stock appreciation rights the related tax benefit and the employee stock purchase plan 344 million cash flow related to financing activities resulted in a net use of cash in 2006 of 1327 million during 2006 garmin repurchased 1155300 shares of its common shares under the 3000000share stock repurchase program that was approved by the board of directors on august 3 2006 and expired on december 31 2007 sources and uses in financing activities during 2006 related primarily to uses for the payment of a dividend 1079 million and stock repurchase 505 million and a source of cash from the issuance of common shares related to the exercise of employee stock options and stock appreciation rights and the related tax benefit and the employee stock purchase plan 257 million 

cash dividends paid to shareholders were 1503 million 1625 million and 1079 million during fiscal years 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively 

we currently use cash flow from operations to fund our capital expenditures to support our working capital requirements and to repurchase shares we expect that future cash requirements will principally be for capital expenditures working capital repurchase of shares and payment of dividends declared 

we believe that our existing cash balances and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our projected capital expenditures working capital and other cash requirements at least through the end of fiscal 2009 

 

 

contractual obligations and commercial commitments 

future commitments of garmin as of december 27 2008 aggregated by type of contractual obligation are 

 

 

operating leases describes lease obligations associated with garmin facilities located in the us taiwan europe and canada purchase obligations are the aggregate of those purchase orders that were outstanding on december 27 2008 these obligations are created and then paid off within 3 months during the normal course of our manufacturing business 

we may be required to make significant cash outlays related to unrecognized tax benefits however due to the uncertainty of the timing of future cash flows associated with our unrecognized tax benefits we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement if any with the respective taxing authorities accordingly unrecognized tax benefits of 2144 million as of december 27 2008 have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above for further information related to unrecognized tax benefits see note 2 “income taxes” to the consolidated financial statements included in this report 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we do not have any offbalance sheet arrangements 

 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market sensitivity 

 

we have market risk primarily in connection with the pricing of our products and services and the purchase of raw materials product pricing and raw materials costs are both significantly influenced by semiconductor market conditions historically during cyclical industry downturns we have been able to offset pricing declines for our products through a combination of improved product mix and success in obtaining price reductions in raw materials costs 

inflation 

we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our business financial condition or results of operations if our costs were to become subject to significant inflationary pressures we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs through price increases our inability or failure to do so could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

the operation of garmin’s subsidiaries in international markets results in exposure to movements in currency exchange rates we have experienced significant foreign currency gains and losses due to the strengthening and weakening of the us dollar the potential of volatile foreign exchange rate fluctuations in the future could have a significant effect on our results of operations 

 

 

the currencies that create a majority of the company’s exchange rate exposure are the taiwan dollar the euro and british pound sterling garmin corporation headquartered in shijr taiwan uses the local currency as the functional currency the company translates all assets and liabilities at yearend exchange rates and income and expense accounts at average rates during the year in order to minimize the effect of the currency exchange fluctuations on our net assets we have elected to retain most of our taiwan subsidiary’s cash and investments in marketable securities denominated in us dollars in 2008 the taiwan dollar weakened 16 relative to the us dollar which resulted in a cumulative translation adjustment of negative 153 million at the end of fiscal 2008 and a net foreign currency gain of 208 million at garmin corporation during 2008 

all european subsidiaries excluding garmin europe ltd garmin danmark and garmin sweden use the euro as the functional currency  the functional currency of our largest european subsidiary garmin europe ltd remains the us dollar and as some transactions occurred in british pounds sterling or euros foreign currency gains or losses have been realized historically related to the movements of those currencies relative to the us dollar the company believes that gains and losses will become more material in the future as our european presence grows in 2008 the euro weakened 41 relative to the us dollar and the british pound sterling weakened 261 relative to the us dollar these currency moves resulted in a foreign currency loss of 773 million in garmin ltd and our european subsidiaries offsetting this net loss was a realized gain of 215 million due to the strengthening of the euro between the date of purchase of the tele atlas nv shares in october 2007 to the dates of sale and tender in february march and june 2008 the net result of these currency moves combined with other losses of 03 million and the timing of transactions during the year for a net loss of 353 million for the company 

 

interest rate risk 

we have no outstanding longterm debt as of december 27 2008 we therefore have no meaningful debtrelated interest rate risk 

we are exposed to interest rate risk in connection with our investments in marketable securities as interest rates change the unrealized gains and losses associated with those securities will fluctuate accordingly a hypothetical change of 10 in interest rates would not have a material effect on such unrealized gains or losses at december 27 2008 cumulative unrealized losses on those securities were 222 million

a company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate

company overview 

garmin is a leading worldwide provider of navigation communications and information devices most of which are enabled by global positioning system “gps” technology garmin designs develops manufactures and markets a diverse family of handheld portable and fixedmount gpsenabled products and other navigation communications and information products for the automotivemobile outdoorfitness marine and general aviation markets 

 

overview of the global positioning system 

the global positioning system is a worldwide navigation system which enables the precise determination of geographic location using established satellite technology the system consists of a constellation of orbiting satellites the satellites and their ground control and monitoring stations are maintained and operated by the united states department of defense which maintains an ongoing satellite replenishment program to ensure continuous global system coverage access to the system is provided free of charge by the us government 

prior to may 2000 the us department of defense intentionally degraded the accuracy of civilian gps signals in a process known as selective availability ‘‘sa’’ for national security purposes sa variably degraded gps position accuracy to a radius of 100 meters on may 2 2000 the us department of defense discontinued sa in a presidential policy statement issued in december 2004 the bush administration indicated that the us does not intend to implement sa again and is committed to preventing hostile use of gps through regional denial of service minimizing the impact to peaceful users with sa removed a gps receiver can calculate its position to an accuracy of approximately 10 meters or less enhancing the utility of gps for most applications 

the accuracy and utility of gps can be enhanced through augmentation techniques which compute any remaining errors in the signal and broadcast these corrections to a gps device the federal aviation administration “faa” has developed a wide area augmentation system ‘‘waas’’ comprising ground reference stations and additional satellites that improve the accuracy of gps positioning available in the united states and portions of canada and mexico to approximately 3 meters waas supports the use of gps as the primary means of enroute terminal and approach navigation for aviation in the united states the increased accuracy offered by waas also enhances the utility of waasenabled gps receivers for consumer applications the faa announced on july 11 2003 that the waas system had achieved initial operating capability and that the system was available for instrument flight use with appropriately certified avionics equipment since that time the faa has installed additional ground reference stations and has launched additional waas satellites

competition 

the market for navigation communications and information products is highly competitive garmin believes the principal competitive factors impacting the market for its products are design functionality quality and reliability customer service brand price timetomarket and availability garmin believes that it generally competes favorably in each of these areas 

garmin believes that its principal competitors for portable automotive products are tomtom nv magellan navigation inc “magellan” mio technology ltd and navigon ag garmin believes that its principal competitors for handheld recreational product lines are magellan and lowrance electronics inc “lowrance” for marine chartplotter products garmin believes that its principal competitors are raymarine ltd “raymarine” furuno electronic company “furuno” lowrance and simrad yachting as for garmin’s fishfinderdepth sounder product lines garmin believes that its principal competitors are lowrance raymarine the humminbird division of johnson outdoors inc navman simrad and furuno for garmin’s general aviation product lines garmin considers its principal competitors to be lowrance for portable gps units and honeywell inc avidyne corporation l3 avionics systems meggitt plc rockwell collins inc universal avionics systems corporation chelton flight systems aspen avionics and free flight systems for panelmount gps and display units for garmin’s family radio service and general mobile radio service product line garmin believes that its principal competitors are motorola inc “motorola” cobra electronics corporation and audiovox corporation 

 

research and development 

garmin’s product innovations are driven by its strong emphasis on research and development and the close partnership between garmin’s engineering and manufacturing teams garmin’s products are created by its engineering and development staff which numbered 1 389 people worldwide as of december 29 2007 garmin’s manufacturing staff includes manufacturing process engineers who work closely with garmin’s design engineers to ensure manufacturability and manufacturing cost control for its products garmin’s development staff includes industrial designers as well as software engineers electrical engineers mechanical engineers and cartographic engineers garmin believes the industrial design of its products has played an important role in garmin’s success once a development project is initiated and approved a multidisciplinary team is created to design the product and transition it into manufacturing 

below is a table of garmin’s expenditures on research and development over the last three fiscal years 

 

manufacturing and operations 

garmin believes that one of its core competencies is its manufacturing capability at its shijr jhongli and linkou taiwan facilities its olathe kansas facility and its salem oregon facility garmin believes that its vertically integrated approach has provided it the following benefits 

reduced timetomarket utilizing concurrent engineering techniques garmin’s products are introduced to production at an early development stage and the feedback provided by manufacturing is incorporated into the design before mass production begins in this manner garmin attempts to reduce the time required to move a product from its design phase to mass production deliveries with improved quality and yields 

design and process optimization garmin uses its manufacturing resources to rapidly prototype design concepts products and processes in order to achieve higher efficiency lower cost and better value for customers garmin’s ability to fully explore product design and manufacturing process concepts has enabled it to optimize its designs to minimize size and weight in gps devices that are functional waterproof and rugged 

logistical agility operating its own manufacturing facilities helps garmin minimize problems such as component shortages and long component lead times which are common in the electronics industry many products can be reengineered to bypass component shortages or reduce cost and the new designs can be delivered to market quickly garmin reacts rapidly to changes in market demand by striving to maintain a safety stock of longlead components and by rescheduling components from one product line to another 

garmin’s design manufacturing distribution and servicing processes in our us taiwan and uk facilities are certified to iso 90012000 an international quality standard developed by the international organization for standardization garmin’s taiwan manufacturing facilities have also achieved ts 169492002 certification a quality standard for automotive suppliers in addition garmin’s aviation operations have achieved certification to as9100 the quality standard for the aviation industry 

in january 2007 garmin’s taiwan facilities also achieved certification of their environmental management systems to the iso140011994 standard this certification recognizes that garmin’s taiwan subsidiary has systems and processes in place to minimize or prevent harmful effects on the environment and to strive continually to improve its environmental performance garmin europe and garmin international inc are currently pursuing compliance to the iso 14000 standard 

materials 

garmin purchases components for its products from a number of suppliers around the world for certain components garmin relies on sole source suppliers the failure of our suppliers to deliver components in sufficient quantities and in a timely manner could adversely affect our business 

 

seasonality 

our sales are subject to significant seasonal fluctuation sales of our consumer products are generally significantly higher in the fourth quarter due to increased demand for automotivemobile products during the holiday buying season and to a lesser extent the second quarter due to increased demand during the spring and summer marine season and the father’s daygraduation buying season sales of consumer products are also influenced by the timing of the release of new products our aviation products do not experience much seasonal variation but are more influenced by the timing of the release of new products when the initial demand is typically the strongest 

backlog 

our sales are generally of a consumer nature and there is a relatively short cycle between order and shipment therefore we believe that backlog information is not material to the understanding of our business we typically ship most orders within 72 hours of receipt 

intellectual property 

our success and ability to compete is dependent in part on our proprietary technology we rely on a combination of patent copyright trademark and trade secret laws as well as confidentiality agreements to establish and protect our proprietary rights as of january 11 2008 we held 331 us patents and 42 foreign patents as of january 11 2008 we had 190 us patent applications and 32 foreign patent applications pending in addition garmin often relies on licenses of intellectual property for use in its business for example garmin obtains licenses for digital cartography technology for use in our products from various sources as of january 11 2008 we held 81 us trademark registrations and 162 foreign trademark registrations as of january 11 2008 we had 28 us trademark applications and 73 foreign trademark applications pending 

we believe that our continued success depends on the intellectual skills of our employees and their ability to continue to innovate garmin will continue to file and prosecute patent applications when appropriate to attempt to protect garmin’s rights in its proprietary technologies garmin was selected as a constituent of the ocean tomo® 300 patent index and the ocean tomo® 300 patent growth index which are indices that recognize companies with high intellectual property value 

there is no assurance that our current patents or patents which we may later acquire may successfully withstand any challenge in whole or in part it is also possible that any patent issued to us may not provide us with any competitive advantages or that the patents of others will preclude us from manufacturing and marketing certain products despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights to protect its trade secrets to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others or to defend against claims of infringement or invalidity 

regulations 

the telecommunications industry is highly regulated and the regulatory environment in which garmin operates is subject to change in accordance with federal communication commission “fcc” rules and regulations wireless transceiver and cellular handset products are required to be certified by the fcc and comparable authorities in foreign countries where they are sold garmin’s products sold in europe are required to comply with relevant directives of the european commission a delay in receiving required certifications for new products or enhancements to garmin’s products or losing certification for garmin’s existing products could adversely affect our business in addition aviation products that are intended for installation in “type certificated aircraft” are required to be certified by the faa its european counterpart the european aviation safety agency and other comparable organizations before they can be used in an aircraft 

because garmin corporation one of the company’s principal subsidiaries is located in taiwan foreign exchange control laws and regulations of taiwan with respect to remittances into and out of taiwan may have an impact on garmin’s operations the taiwan foreign exchange control statute and regulations thereunder provide that all foreign exchange transactions must be executed by banks designated to handle such business by the ministry of finance of taiwan and by the central bank of china also referred to as the cbc current regulations favor traderelated foreign exchange transactions consequently foreign currency earned from exports of merchandise and services may now be retained and used freely by exporters while all foreign currency needed for the import of merchandise and services may be purchased freely from the designated foreign exchange banks aside from traderelated foreign exchange transactions taiwan companies and residents may without foreign exchange approval remit outside and into taiwan foreign currencies of up to 50 million and 5 million respectively or their equivalent each calendar year currency conversions within the limits are processed by the designated banks and do not have to be reviewed and approved by the cbc the above limits apply to remittances involving a conversion between new taiwan dollars and us dollars or other foreign currencies the cbc typically approves foreign exchange in excess of the limits if a party applies with the cbc for review and presents legitimate business reasons justifying the currency conversion a requirement is also imposed on all enterprises to register all medium and longterm foreign debt with the cbc 

environmental matters 

 

the european union “eu” has enacted the restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment directive rohs directive and the waste electrical and electronic equipment directive “weee directive” the rohs directive requires eu member states to enact laws prohibiting the use of certain substances including lead mercury cadmium and hexavalent chromium in certain electronic products put on the market after july 1 2006 the weee directive requires eu member states to enact laws that were to go into effect by august 13 2005 regulating the collection recovery and recycling of waste from certain electronic products we have established a program in order to comply with such laws and regulations as they are enacted by the eu member states we have modified the design of our products and our manufacturing processes in order to comply with such laws and regulations 

the eu has also enacted the registration evaluation and authorization of chemicals “reach” regulation reach requires manufacturers and importers of articles to register the substances contained in the articles if the substances are intended to be released under normal or reasonably foreseeable conditions of use because the substances contained in our products are not intended to be released under normal or reasonably foreseeable conditions of use we do not believe we or the importers of our products have an obligation under reach to register those substances it is possible however that garmin could participate in the reach regulations as necessary to support possible reach registration requirements of the recyclers of our products reach also imposes notification requirements on manufacturers and importers of articles if the articles contain “substances of very high concern” although these notification requirements do not become effective until after june 1 2011 we have established a program in order to comply with them when and to the extent necessary 

the people’s republic of china has enacted legislation which is widely known as “china rohs” the first phase of china rohs took effect on march 1 2007 and requires the disclosure and marking of certain substances including lead mercury cadmium and hexavalent chromium in certain electronic products we have established a program in order to comply with the first phase of china rohs 

the state of california has enacted legislation similar to the rohs directive and other states and countries have promulgated or proposed legislation similar to the rohs directive andor the weee directive the need for and cost of our compliance with such legislation cannot yet be determined but the cost could be substantial 

several states have enacted laws pertaining to the reduction of mercury in products and the labeling of mercurycontaining products including the member states of the interstate mercury education and reduction clearinghouse imerc some of these laws including those in connecticut new york vermont and louisiana are applicable to certain of garmin’s gps products we have established an ongoing compliance program to ensure that we are fulfilling the notice and labeling requirements set forth in the relevant mercury legislation 

portable garmin products which use acdc adapters as an option for battery charging would require submissions of energyuse profiles if and when the future implementing measures resulting from the eu eup energy using products directive define such products as being within their scope 

 

employees 

as of december 31 2007 garmin had 8434   fulltime employees worldwide of whom 2443 were in the united states 67 were in canada 5444 were in taiwan 475 were in europe and 5 were in other global locations none of garmin’s employees are represented by a labor union except for garmin’s four employees in brazil and none of garmins north american or taiwan employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement garmin considers its employee relations to be good 

 




 item 1a risk factors 

the risks described below are not the only ones facing our company additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also impair our business operations if any of the following risks occur our business financial condition or operating results could be materially adversely affected 

risks related to the company 

many of our products rely on the global positioning system 

the global positioning system is a satellitebased navigation and positioning system consisting of a constellation of orbiting satellites the satellites and their ground control and monitoring stations are maintained and operated by the united states department of defense the department of defense does not currently charge users for access to the satellite signals these satellites and their ground support systems are complex electronic systems subject to electronic and mechanical failures and possible sabotage the satellites were originally designed to have lives of 75 years and are subject to damage by the hostile space environment in which they operate however of the current deployment of satellites in place some have been operating for more than 13 years 

if a significant number of satellites were to become inoperable unavailable or are not replaced it would impair the current utility of our global positioning system products and would have a material negative effect on our business in addition there can be no assurance that the us government will remain committed to the operation and maintenance of global positioning system satellites over a long period or that the policies of the us government that provide for the use of the global positioning system without charge and without accuracy degradation will remain unchanged because of the increasing commercial applications of the global positioning system other us government agencies may become involved in the administration or the regulation of the use of global positioning system signals however in a presidential policy statement issued in december 2004 the bush administration indicated that the us is committed to supporting and improving the global positioning system and will continue providing it free from direct user fees 

some of our products also use signals from systems that augment gps such as the wide area augmentation system waas waas is operated by the faa any curtailment of the operating capability of waas could result in decreased user capability for many of our aviation products thereby impacting our markets 

any of the foregoing factors could affect the willingness of buyers of our products to select global positioning systembased products instead of products based on competing technologies 

 

a shut down of us airspace or imposition of restrictions on general aviation would harm our business 

following the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks the faa ordered all aircraft operating in the us to be grounded for several days in addition to this shut down of us airspace the general aviation industry was further impacted by the additional restrictions implemented by the faa on those flights that fly utilizing visual flight rules vfr the faa restricted vfr flight inside 30 enhanced class b a 2025 mile radius around the 30 largest metropolitan areas in the usa airspace areas the aircraft owners and pilots association aopa estimated that these restrictions affected approximately 41800 general aviation aircraft based at 282 airports inside the 30 enhanced class b airspace areas the aopa estimates that approximately 90 of all general aviation flights are conducted vfr and that only 15 of general aviation pilots are current to fly utilizing instrument flight rules ifr 

 

the shut down of us airspace following september 11 2001 caused reduced sales of our general aviation products and delays in the shipment of our products manufactured in our taiwan manufacturing facility to our distribution facility in olathe kansas thereby adversely affecting our ability to supply new and existing products to our dealers and distributors 

any future shut down of us airspace or imposition of restrictions on general aviation could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results 

 

any reallocation of radio frequency spectrum could cause interference with the reception of global positioning system signals this interference could harm our business 

our global positioning system technology is dependent on the use of the standard positioning service sps provided by the us government’s global positioning system satellites the global positioning system operates in radio frequency bands that are globally allocated for radio navigation satellite services the assignment of spectrum is controlled by an international organization known as the international telecommunications union ‘‘itu’’ the federal communications commission ‘‘fcc’’ is responsible for the assignment of spectrum for nongovernment use in the united states in accordance with itu regulations any itu or fcc reallocation of radio frequency spectrum including frequency band segmentation or sharing of spectrum could cause interference with the reception of global positioning system signals and may materially and adversely affect the utility and reliability of our products which would in turn have a material adverse effect on our operating results in addition emissions from mobile satellite service and other equipment operating in adjacent frequency bands or inband may materially and adversely affect the utility and reliability of our products which could result in a material adverse effect on our operating results the fcc continually receives proposals for new technologies and services such as ultrawideband technologies which may seek to operate in or across the radio frequency bands currently used by the gps sps adverse decisions by the fcc that result in harmful interference to the delivery of the gps sps may materially and adversely affect the utility and reliability of our products which could result in a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition 

 

if we are not successful in the continued development introduction or timely manufacture of new products demand for our products could decrease 

we expect that a significant portion of our future revenue will continue to be derived from sales of newly introduced products the market for our products is characterized by rapidly changing technology evolving industry standards and changes in customer needs if we fail to introduce new products or to modify or improve our existing products in response to changes in technology industry standards or customer needs our products could rapidly become less competitive or obsolete we must continue to make significant investments in research and development in order to continue to develop new products enhance existing products and achieve market acceptance for such products however there can be no assurance that development stage products will be successfully completed or if developed will achieve significant customer acceptance 

if we are unable to successfully develop and introduce competitive new products and enhance our existing products our future results of operations would be adversely affected our pursuit of necessary technology may require substantial time and expense we may need to license new technologies to respond to technological change these licenses may not be available to us on terms that we can accept or may materially change the gross profits that we are able to obtain on our products we may not succeed in adapting our products to new technologies as they emerge development and manufacturing schedules for technology products are difficult to predict and there can be no assurance that we will achieve timely initial customer shipments of new products the timely availability of these products in volume and their acceptance by customers are important to our future success from time to time we have experienced delays in shipping certain of our new products and any future delays whether due to product development delays manufacturing delays lack of market acceptance delays in regulatory approval or otherwise could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

 

 

if we do not correctly anticipate demand for our products we may not be able to secure sufficient quantities or costeffective production of our products or we could have costly excess production or inventories 

historically we have experienced steady increases in demand for our products although we did experience a decline in demand for our aviation products in 2001 due to declining economic conditions and the shut down of us airspace as a result of the terrorist attacks that occurred on september 11 2001 we have generally been able to increase production to meet this increasing demand however the demand for our products depends on many factors and will be difficult to forecast we expect that it will become more difficult to forecast demand as we introduce and support multiple products as competition in the market for our products intensifies and as the markets for some of our products mature to the mass market category significant unanticipated fluctuations in demand could cause the following problems in our operations 

 

 

 

 

we may become subject to significant product liability costs 

if our aviation products malfunction or contain errors or defects airplane collisions or crashes could occur resulting in property damage personal injury or death malfunctions or errors or defects in our marine navigational products could cause boats to run aground or cause other wreckage personal injury or death if our automotive or marine products contain defects or errors in the mapping supplied by thirdparty map providers or if our users do not heed our warnings about the proper use of these products collisions or accidents could occur resulting in property damage personal injury or death if any of these events occurs we could be subject to significant liability for personal injury and property damage and under certain circumstances could be subject to a judgment for punitive damages we maintain insurance against accidentrelated risks involving our products however there can be no assurance that such insurance would be sufficient to cover the cost of damages to others or that such insurance will continue to be available at commercially reasonable rates in addition insurance coverage generally will not cover awards of punitive damages and may not cover the cost of associated legal fees and defense costs which could result in lower margins if we are unable to maintain sufficient insurance to cover product liability costs or if our insurance coverage does not cover the award this could have a materially adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we depend on our suppliers some of which are the sole source for specific components and our production would be seriously harmed if these suppliers are not able to meet our demand and alternative sources are not available or if the costs of components rise 

we are dependent on third party suppliers for various components used in our current products some of the components that we procure from third party suppliers include semiconductors and electroluminescent panels liquid crystal displays memory chips batteries and microprocessors the cost quality and availability of components are essential to the successful production and sale of our products some components we use are from sole source suppliers certain applicationspecific integrated circuits incorporating our proprietary designs are manufactured for us by sole source suppliers alternative sources may not be currently available for these sole source components 

 

in the past we have experienced shortages of liquid crystal displays and other components in addition if there are shortages in supply of components the costs of such components may rise if suppliers are unable to meet our demand for components on a timely basis and if we are unable to obtain an alternative source or if the price of the alternative source is prohibitive or if the costs of components rise our ability to maintain timely and costeffective production of our products would be seriously harmed 

 

we depend on third party licensors for the digital map data contained in our automotivemobile products and our business andor gross margins could be harmed if we become unable to continue licensing such mapping data or if the royalty costs for such data rise 

 

we license digital mapping data for use in our products from various sources there are only a limited number of suppliers of mapping data for each geographical region the two largest digital map suppliers are navteq corporation and tele atlas nv nokia has signed a merger agreement with navteq and such merger agreement has been approved by navteq’s shareholders as of february 21 2008 the proposed merger between nokia and navteq is currently pending regulatory review by the european commission and other closing conditions in addition tom tom one of our main competitors in the pnd market is in the process of attempting to acquire tele atlas through an offer to purchase all of the issued ordinary shares of tele atlas as of february 22 2008 tom tom’s proposed offer to purchase the tele atlas shares was under regulatory review by the european commission 

if both of these transactions close the two largest digital map suppliers will become whollyowned subsidiaries of garmin competitors although we do not foresee difficulty in continuing to license data at favorable pricing due to the long term extension signed between garmin and navteq in november 2007 extending our navteq agreement through 2015 with an option to extend through 2019 if we are unable to continue licensing such mapping data and are unable to obtain an alternative source or if the nature of our relationships with navteq or tele atlas change detrimentally our ability to supply mapping data for use in our products would be seriously harmed 

 

we rely on independent dealers and distributors to sell our products and disruption to these channels would harm our business 

because we sell a majority of our products to independent dealers and distributors we are subject to many risks including risks related to their inventory levels and support for our products in particular our dealers and distributors maintain significant levels of our products in their inventories if dealers and distributors attempt to reduce their levels of inventory or if they do not maintain sufficient levels to meet customer demand our sales could be negatively impacted 

many of our dealers and distributors also sell products offered by our competitors if our competitors offer our dealers and distributors more favorable terms those dealers and distributors may deemphasize or decline to carry our products in the future we may not be able to retain or attract a sufficient number of qualified dealers and distributors if we are unable to maintain successful relationships with dealers and distributors or to expand our distribution channels our business will suffer 

 

failure to manage our growth and expansion effectively could adversely impact our business 

our ability to successfully offer our products and implement our business plan in a rapidly evolving market requires an effective planning and management process we continue to increase the scope of our operations domestically and internationally and have grown our shipments and headcount substantially this growth has placed and our anticipated growth in future operations will continue to place a significant strain on our management systems and resources 

our business may suffer if we are not able to hire and retain sufficient qualified personnel or if we lose our key personnel 

our future success depends partly on the continued contribution of our key executive engineering sales marketing manufacturing and administrative personnel we currently do not have employment agreements with any of our key executive officers we do not have key man life insurance on any of our key executive officers and do not currently intend to obtain such insurance the loss of the services of any of our senior level management or other key employees could harm our business recruiting and retaining the skilled personnel we require to maintain and grow our market position may be difficult for example in some recent years there has been a nationwide shortage of qualified electrical engineers and software engineers who are necessary for us to design and develop new products and therefore it has sometimes been challenging to recruit such personnel if we fail to hire and retain qualified employees we may not be able to maintain and expand our business 

 

gross margins for our products may fluctuate or erode 

gross margins on our automotivemobile products have been declining due to price reductions in the increasingly competitive market for personal navigation devices pnds we expect that gross margins on automotivemobile products will continue to erode in addition our overall gross margin may fluctuate from period to period due to a number of factors including product mix competition and unit volumes in particular the average selling prices of a specific product tend to decrease over that product’s life to offset such decreases we intend to rely primarily on component cost reduction obtaining yield improvements and corresponding cost reductions in the manufacture of existing products and on introducing new products that incorporate advanced features and therefore can be sold at higher average selling prices however there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain any such yield improvements or cost reductions or introduce any such new products in the future to the extent that such cost reductions and new product introductions do not occur in a timely manner or our products do not achieve market acceptance our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

our quarterly operating results are subject to fluctuations and seasonality and may be negatively affected by weakness in the economy 

our operating results are difficult to predict our future quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly if such operating results decline the price of our stock would likely decline as we expand our operations our operating expenses particularly our advertising and research and development costs may increase as a percentage of our sales if revenues decrease and we are unable to reduce those costs rapidly our operating results would be negatively affected 

historically our revenues have usually been weaker in the first and third quarters of each fiscal year and have from time to time been lower than the preceding quarter our devices are highly consumeroriented and consumer buying is traditionally lower in these quarters sales of certain of our marine and automotive   products tend to be higher in our second fiscal quarter due to increased consumer spending for such products during the recreational marine fishing and travel season sales of our automotivemobile products also have been higher in our fourth fiscal quarter due to increased consumer spending patterns on electronic devices during the holiday season   in addition we attempt to time our new product releases to coincide with relatively higher consumer spending in the second and fourth fiscal quarters which contributes to these seasonal variations 

since our products are highly consumeroriented a significant slowdown in discretionary spending or consumer confidence due to an economic recession or slowdown in the united states or worldwide economies could negatively impact our revenues 

 

adverse economic conditions may harm our investments 

inflation or other changes in general economic conditions could adversely affect our investment portfolio 

our quarterly financial statements will reflect fluctuations in foreign currency translation 

our taiwan subsidiary holds and is expected to continue to hold significant cash cash equivalents and marketable securities and receivables denominated in us dollars because the us dollar is the primary currency for our business and in order to substantially reduce the economic consequence of any variation in the exchange rate for the us dollar and the new taiwan dollar on these assets management expects that the taiwan subsidiary will continue to hold the majority of these assets in us dollar or us dollar denominated instruments nonetheless us gaap requires the company at the end of each accounting period to translate into new taiwan dollars all such us dollar denominated assets held by our taiwan subsidiary this translation is required because the new taiwan dollar is the functional currency of the subsidiary this us gaapmandated translation will cause us to recognize gain or loss on our financial statements as the new taiwan dollarus dollar exchange rate varies such gain or loss will create variations in our earnings per share because there is minimal cash impact caused by such exchange rate variations management will continue to focus on the company’s operating performance before the impact of the foreign currency translation 

if we are unable to compete effectively with existing or new competitors our resulting loss of competitive position could result in price reductions fewer customer orders reduced margins and loss of market share 

the markets for our products are highly competitive and we expect competition to increase in the future some of our competitors have significantly greater financial technical and marketing resources than we do these competitors may be able to respond more rapidly to new or emerging technologies or changes in customer requirements they may also be able to devote greater resources to the development promotion and sale of their products increased competition could result in price reductions fewer customer orders reduced margins and loss of market share our failure to compete successfully against current or future competitors could seriously harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

our intellectual property rights are important to our operations and we could suffer loss if they infringe upon other’s rights or are infringed upon by others 

we rely on a combination of patents copyrights trademarks and trade secrets confidentiality provisions and licensing arrangements to establish and protect our proprietary rights to this end we hold rights to a number of patents and registered trademarks and regularly file applications to attempt to protect our rights in new technology and trademarks however there is no guarantee that our patent applications will become issued patents or that our trademark applications will become registered trademarks moreover even if approved our patents or trademarks may thereafter be successfully challenged by others or otherwise become invalidated for a variety of reasons thus any patents or trademarks we currently have or may later acquire may not provide us a significant competitive advantage 

third parties may claim that we are infringing their intellectual property rights such claims could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition from time to time we receive letters alleging infringement of patents trademarks or other intellectual property rights litigation concerning patents or other intellectual property is costly and time consuming we may seek licenses from such parties but they could refuse to grant us a license or demand commercially unreasonable terms we might not have sufficient resources to pay for the licenses such infringement claims could also cause us to incur substantial liabilities and to suspend or permanently cease the use of critical technologies or processes or the production or sale of major products 

failure to obtain required certifications of our products on a timely basis could harm our business 

we have certain products especially in our aviation segment that are subject to governmental and similar certifications before they can be sold for example faa certification is required for all of our aviation products that are intended for installation in type certificated aircraft to the extent required certification is an expensive and timeconsuming process that requires significant focus and resources an inability to obtain or excessive delay in obtaining such certifications could have an adverse effect on our ability to introduce new products and for certain aviation oem products our customers’ ability to sell airplanes therefore such inabilities or delays could adversely affect our operating results   in addition we cannot assure you that our certified products will not be decertified any such decertification could have an adverse effect on our operating results 

our business is subject to economic political and other risks associated with international sales and operations 

our business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally we estimate that approximately 39 of our net sales in the fiscal year ended december 29 2007 represented products shipped to international destinations accordingly our business financial condition and results of operations could be harmed by a variety of international factors including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we may experience unique economic and political risks associated with companies that operate in taiwan 

relations between taiwan and the people’s republic of china also referred to as the prc and other factors affecting the political or economic conditions of taiwan in the future could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations and the market price and the liquidity of our shares our principal manufacturing facilities where we manufacture all of our products except our panelmounted aviation products are located in taiwan 

taiwan has a unique international political status the prc asserts sovereignty over all of china including taiwan certain other islands and all of mainland china the prc government does not recognize the legitimacy of the taiwan government although significant economic and cultural relations have been established during recent years between taiwan and the prc the prc government has indicated that it may use military force to gain control over taiwan in certain circumstances such as the declaration of independence by taiwan relations between taiwan and the prc have on occasion adversely affected the market value of taiwanese companies and could negatively affect our operations in taiwan in the future 

there is uncertainty as to our shareholders’ ability to enforce certain foreign civil liabilities in the cayman islands and taiwan 

we are a cayman islands company and a substantial portion of our assets are located outside the united states particularly in taiwan as a result it may be difficult to effect service of process within the united states upon us in addition there is uncertainty as to whether the courts of the cayman islands or taiwan would recognize or enforce judgments of united states courts obtained against us predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the united states or any state thereof or be competent to hear original actions brought in the cayman islands or taiwan against us predicated upon the securities laws of the united states or any state thereof 

 

 

our shareholders may face difficulties in protecting their interests because we are incorporated under cayman islands law 

our corporate affairs are governed by our memorandum and articles of association as amended and by the companies law 2007 revision and the common law of the cayman islands the rights of our shareholders and the fiduciary responsibilities of our directors under cayman islands law are not as clearly established as under statutes or judicial precedent in existence in jurisdictions in the united states therefore you may have more difficulty in protecting your interests in the face of actions by the management directors or our controlling shareholders than would shareholders of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction in the united states due to the comparatively less developed nature of cayman islands law in this area 

unlike many jurisdictions in the united states cayman islands law does not specifically provide for shareholder appraisal rights on a merger or consolidation of a company this may make it more difficult for you to assess the value of any consideration you may receive in a merger or consolidation or to require that the offeror give you additional consideration if you believe the consideration offered is insufficient 

shareholders of cayman islands exempted companies such as garmin have no general rights under cayman islands law to inspect corporate records and accounts or to obtain copies of lists of shareholders of the company this may make it more difficult for you to obtain the information needed to establish any facts necessary for a shareholder motion or to solicit proxies from other shareholders in connection with a proxy contest 

subject to limited exceptions under cayman islands law a minority shareholder may not bring a derivative action against the board of directors our cayman islands counsel has advised that they are not aware of any reported class action or derivative action having been brought in a cayman islands court 

 

we may pursue strategic acquisitions investments strategic partnerships or other ventures and our business could be materially harmed if we fail to successfully identify complete and integrate such transactions 

we intend to evaluate acquisition opportunities and opportunities to make investments in complementary businesses technologies services or products or to enter into strategic partnerships with parties who can provide access to those assets additional product or services offerings additional distribution or marketing synergies or additional industry expertise in 2007 we acquired digital cyclone inc eme tecsat sas gesellschaft für professionelle satellitennavigation mbh synergy spa electrónica trepat sa and the assets of nautamatic marine systems inc we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition investment or strategic partnership candidates or if we do identify suitable candidates in the future we may not be able to complete those transactions on commercially favorable terms or at all 

any past or future acquisitions could also result in difficulties assimilating acquired employees including cultural differences with foreign acquisitions operations and products and diversion of capital and management’s attention away from other business issues and opportunities integration of acquired companies may result in problems related to integration of technology and inexperienced management teams in addition the key personnel of the acquired company may decide not to work for us our management has had limited experience in assimilating acquired organizations and products into our operations we may not successfully integrate internal controls compliance under the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 and other corporate governance matters operations personnel or products related to acquisitions we made in 2007 or may make in the future if we fail to successfully integrate such transactions our business could be materially harmed 

 

we have benefited in the past from taiwan government tax incentives offered on certain high technology capital investments that may not always be available 

our effective tax rate is lower than the us federal statutory rate because we have benefited from incentives offered in taiwan related to our high technology investments in taiwan the loss of these tax benefits could have a significant effect on our financial results in the future 

changes in our united states federal income tax classification or in applicable tax law could result in adverse tax consequences to our shareholders 

we do not believe that we or any of our nonunited states subsidiaries are currently a ‘‘passive foreign investment company’’ for united states federal income tax purposes we do not expect to become a passive foreign investment company however because the passive foreign investment company determination is made annually on the basis of facts and circumstances that may be beyond our control and because the principles for applying the passive foreign investment company tests are not entirely clear we cannot assure that we will not become a passive foreign investment company if we are a passive foreign investment company in any year then any of our shareholders that is a united states person could be liable to pay tax at ordinary income tax rates plus an interest charge upon some distributions by us or when that shareholder sells our common shares at a gain further if we are classified as a passive foreign investment company in any year in which a united states person is a shareholder we generally will continue to be treated as a passive foreign investment company with respect to such shareholder in all succeeding years regardless of whether we continue to satisfy the income or asset tests described above additional tax considerations would apply if we or any of our subsidiaries were a controlled foreign corporation 

 

we may have additional tax liabilities   

we are subject to income taxes in both the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes in the ordinary course of our business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain we are regularly under audit by tax authorities although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals the results of an audit or litigation could have a material effect on our income tax provision net income or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made 

 

risks relating to our shares 

 

the volatility of our stock price could adversely affect investment in our common shares 

the market price of our common shares has been and may continue to be highly volatile during 2007 the price of our common shares ranged from a low of 4846 to a high of 12568 a variety of factors could cause the price of our common shares to fluctuate perhaps substantially including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in addition in recent years the stock market in general and the markets for shares of technology companies in particular have experienced extreme price fluctuations which have often been unrelated to the operating performance of affected companies any such fluctuations in the future could adversely affect the market price of our common shares and the market price of our common shares may decline 

 

our officers and directors exert substantial influence over us 

as of february 15 2008 members and former members of our board of directors and our executive officers together with members of their families and entities that may be deemed affiliates of or related to such persons or entities beneficially owned approximately 40 of our outstanding common shares  accordingly these shareholders may be able to determine the outcome of corporate actions requiring shareholder approval such as mergers and acquisitions this level of ownership may have a significant effect in delaying deferring or preventing a change in control of garmin and may adversely affect the voting and other rights of other holders of our common shares 

 

provisions in our shareholder rights plan and our charter documents might deter delay or prevent a third party from acquiring us and cayman islands corporate law may impede a takeover which could decrease the value of our shares 

our board of directors has the authority to issue up to 1000000 preferred shares and to determine the price rights preferences privileges and restrictions including voting rights of those shares without any further vote or action by the shareholders this could have an adverse impact on the market price of our common shares we have no present plans to issue any preferred shares but we may do so the rights of the holders of common shares may be subject to and adversely affected by the rights of the holders of any preferred shares that may be issued in the future in addition we have adopted a classified board of directors our shareholders are unable to remove any director or the entire board of directors without a super majority vote in addition a super majority vote is required to approve transactions with interested shareholders shareholders do not have the right to call a shareholders meeting we have adopted a shareholders’ rights plan which under certain circumstances would significantly impair the ability of third parties to acquire control of us without prior approval of our board of directors this shareholders’ rights plan and the provisions in our charter documents could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us even if doing so would benefit our shareholders 

unlike many jurisdictions in the united states cayman islands law does not currently provide for mergers as that expression is understood under corporate law in the united states while cayman islands law does have statutory provisions that provide for the reconstruction and amalgamation of companies which are commonly referred to in the cayman islands as a “scheme of arrangement” the procedural and legal requirements necessary to consummate these transactions are more rigorous and take longer to complete than the procedures typically required to consummate a merger in the united states under cayman islands law and practice a scheme of arrangement in relation to a solvent cayman islands exempted company must be approved at a shareholders’ meeting by a majority of the company’s shareholders who are present and voting either in person or by proxy at such meeting the shares voted in favor of the scheme of arrangement must also represent at least 75 of the value of each class of the company’s shareholders excluding the shares owned by the parties to the scheme of arrangement present and voting at the meeting the grand court of the cayman islands must also sanction the convening of these meetings and the terms of the amalgamation although there is no requirement to seek the consent of the creditors of the parties involved in the scheme of arrangement the grand court typically seeks to ensure that the creditors have consented to the transfer of their liabilities to the surviving entity or that the scheme of arrangement does not otherwise materially adversely affect the creditors’ interests furthermore the grand court will only approve a scheme of arrangement if it is satisfied that

overview 

 

we are a leading worldwide provider of navigation communications and information devices most of which are enabled by global positioning system or gps technology we operate in four business segments which serve the marine outdoorfitness automotivemobile and aviation markets our segments offer products through our network of independent dealers and distributors however the nature of products and types of customers for the four segments can vary significantly as such the segments are managed separately our portable gps receivers and accessories for marine recreationfitness and automotivemobile segments are sold primarily to retail outlets our aviation products are portable and panelmount avionics for visual flight rules and instrument flight rules navigation and are sold primarily to retail outlets and certain aircraft manufacturers 

since our first products were delivered in 1991 we have generated positive income from operations each year and have funded our growth from these profits our sales have increased at a compounded annual growth rate of 54 since 2003 and our net income has increased at a compounded annual growth rate of 48 since 2003 the vast majority of this growth has been organic only a very small amount of new revenue occurred as a result of the acquisition of ups aviation technologies inc in 2003 motionbased technologies llc in 2005 dynastream innovations inc in 2006 digital cyclone inc and the assets of nautamatic marine systems inc in 2007 and four european distributors in 2007  garmin france sas garmin deutschland gmbh garmin iberia sa and garmin italia spa these acquisitions had no significant impact on net income for those years 

since our principal locations are in the united states taiwan and the uk we experience some foreign currency fluctuations in our operating results the functional currency of our european operations is the euro effective july 2007 and the functional currency of our asian operations is the new taiwan dollar approximately 80 percent of transactions of our european operations are now denominated in british pounds sterling or the euro we experienced 230 million 06 million 153 million 248 million and 67 million in foreign currency gains losses during fiscal years 2007 2006 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively to date we have not entered into hedging transactions with the euro the british pound sterling the canadian dollar or the new taiwan dollar although we may utilize hedging transactions in the future 

 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

general 

 

garmin’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon garmin’s consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the presentation of these financial statements requires garmin to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis garmin evaluates its estimates including those related to customer sales programs and incentives product returns bad debts inventories investments intangible assets income taxes warranty obligations and contingencies and litigation garmin bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

revenue recognition 

 

garmin records estimated reductions to revenue for customer sales programs returns and incentive offerings including rebates price protection product discounts offered to retailers to assist in clearing older products from their inventories in advance of new product releases promotions and other volumebased incentives the reductions to revenue are based on estimates and judgments using historical experience and expectation of future conditions changes in these estimates could negatively affect garmin’s operating results these incentives are reviewed periodically and with the exceptions of price protection are accrued for on a percentage of sales basis if market conditions were to decline garmin may take actions to increase customer incentive offerings possibly resulting in an incremental reduction of revenue at the time the incentive is offered 

warranties 

 

garmin’s products sold are generally covered by a warranty for periods ranging from one to two years garmin accrues a warranty reserve for estimated costs to provide warranty services garmin’s estimate of costs to service its warranty obligations is based on historical experience and expectation of future conditions to the extent garmin experiences increased warranty claim activity or increased costs associated with servicing those claims its warranty accrual will increase resulting in decreased gross profit 

 

inventory 

 

garmin writes down its inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management additional inventory writedowns may be required 

 

investments 

investments are classified as available for sale and recorded at fair value and unrealized investment gains and losses are reflected in stockholders’ equity investment income is recorded when earned and capital gains and losses are recognized when investments are sold investments are reviewed periodically to determine if they have suffered an impairment of value that is considered other than temporary if investments are determined to be impaired a capital loss is recognized at the date of determination 

testing for impairment of investments also requires significant management judgment the identification of potentially impaired investments the determination of their fair value and the assessment of whether any decline in value is other than temporary are the key judgment elements the discovery of new information and the passage of time can significantly change these judgments revisions of impairment judgments are made when new information becomes known and any resulting impairment adjustments are made at that time the economic environment and volatility of securities markets increase the difficulty of determining fair value and assessing investment impairment 

income taxes 

 

garmin provides deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the difference between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their carrying amount for financial reporting purposes as measured by the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse while no valuation allowance has been recorded it is garmin’s policy to record a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to an amount that it believes is more likely than not to be realized while garmin has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance in the event garmin were to determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax assets in the future an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such determination was made likewise should garmin determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase income in the period such determination was made 

in addition the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations we recognize liabilities for tax audit issues in the us and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes will be due if payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary if our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment a further charge to expense would result 

stock based compensation 

garmin distributes stock options or stock appreciation rights “sars” each year as part of garmin’s compensation package for employees employees with certain levels of responsibility within garmin are eligible for stock option or sar grants but the granting of options or sars is at the discretion of the compensation committee of the board of directors and is not a contractual obligation stock compensation plans are discussed in detail in note 10 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

accounting terms and characteristics 

net sales 

our net sales are primarily generated through sales to our global dealer and distributor network and to original equipment manufacturers we recognize sales when title of the products passes to the customer our sales are largely of a consumer nature therefore backlog levels are not necessarily indicative of our future sales results we aim to achieve a quick turnaround on orders we receive and we typically ship most orders within 72 hours 

net sales are subject to some seasonal fluctuation typically sales of our consumer products are highest in the second quarter due to increased demand during the spring and summer marine season and in the fourth quarter due to increased demand during the holiday buying season our aviation products do not experience much seasonal variation but are more influenced by the timing of the release of new products when the initial demand is typically the strongest 

gross profit 

 

raw material costs are our most significant component of cost of goods sold in the first half of 2007 we experienced favorable product mix and product pricing which allowed us to hold margins in our automotivemobile segment steady margin declines in the second half of 2007 were primarily a result of average selling price declines coupled with raw materials price increases most notably the costs for flash memory in late second quarter and through the third quarter of 2007 when we were purchasing these components for our holiday production runs resulting in margin declines as these components were sold primarily in the fourth quarter of 2007 in the first half of 2006 we experienced meaningful price declines on flash memory and color screens which allowed us to hold margins in our automotivemobile segment steady in the face of price declines and allowed us to improve margins in other business segments as well while these price declines did not continue throughout all of 2006 we did have additional component cost reductions as we neared year end in 2005 we experienced a shift in product mix to lowermargin product groups which continued in 2006 and price declines related to increased competition both in relation to the rapidly growing automotive navigation product line 

our existing practice of performing the design and manufacture of our products inhouse has enabled us to utilize alternative lower cost components from different suppliers and where possible to redesign our products to permit us to use these lower cost components we believe that because of our practice of performing the design manufacture and marketing of our products inhouse our shijr taiwan jhongli taiwan linkou taiwan olathe kansas and salem oregon manufacturing plants have experienced relatively low costs of manufacturing in general products manufactured in taiwan have been our highest volume products our manufacturing labor costs historically have been lower in taiwan than in olathe and salem 

sales price variability has had and can be expected to have an effect on our gross profit in the past prices of our devices sold into the automotivemobile market have declined due to market pressures and introduction of new products sold at lower price points the average selling prices of our aviation products have increased due to product mix and the introduction of more advanced products sold at higher prices the effect of the sales price variability inherent within the mix of gpsenabled products sold could have a significant impact on our gross profit 

 

selling general and administrative expenses 

our selling general and administrative expenses consist primarily of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with the expected increase of total revenues in the future we expect selling general and administrative expenses to continue to increase for the foreseeable future we intend to increase advertising and marketing expenses in order to focus on individual markets and build increased brand awareness in the consumer marketplace especially as we continue to develop new markets and expand opportunities in rapidly growing markets like portable automobile navigation which is becoming a mass market we also intend to increase our customer call center support as our business continues to grow we also anticipate increased selling general and administrative costs associated with information technology staffing and support activities 

 

research and development 

the majority of our research and development costs represent salaries for our engineers costs for high technology components used in product and prototype development and costs of test equipment needed during product development approximately 87 of the research and development of our products is performed in the united states the remainder of our research and development activities are performed by our taiwan engineering group which has increased in size in recent years 

we are committed to increasing the level of innovative design and development of new products as we strive for expanded ability to serve our existing consumer and aviation markets as well as new markets for gpsenabled devices we continue to grow our research and development budget in absolute terms 

 

customers 

 

no customer accounted for 10 or more of our sales in the year ended december 29 2007 our top ten customers have contributed between 25 and 41 of net sales since 2002 we have experienced average sales days in our customer accounts receivable of between 38 and 62 days since 2002 we have experienced an increase in the level of customer accounts receivable days due to changes in product mix and longer payment terms and anticipate maintaining approximately the current level of accounts receivable days going forward 

 

income taxes 

 

we have experienced a relatively low effective corporate tax rate due to the proportion of our revenue generated by entities in tax jurisdictions with low statutory rates in particular lower marginal tax rates and substantial tax incentives offered by the taiwanese government on certain hightechnology capital investments and other taiwan tax credits due to repatriation of 2007 earnings have continued to reduce our tax rate there therefore profits earned in taiwan have been taxed at a lower rate than those in the united states and europe as a result our consolidated effective tax rate was approximately 126 during 2007 we have taken advantage of the tax benefit in taiwan since our inception and we expect to continue to benefit from lower effective tax rates at least through 2012 the current taiwan tax incentives for which garmin has received approval will end in 2012 we plan on applying for additional incentives for years beyond 2012 based on capital investments we expect to make in the future however there can be no assurance that such tax incentives will be available indefinitely or that we will receive the incentives for which we apply management also believes that the revenue shift to our lowertax rate corporate entities will continue however certain tax credits will not be available in 2008 so the effective tax rate for fiscal 2008 is expected to be slightly higher than fiscal 2007 the actual effective tax rate will be dependent upon the production volume additional capital investments made during fiscal 2008 and the composition of our earnings

comparison of fiscal years ended december 29 2007 and december 30 2006 

net sales 

 

 

the increase in total net sales during fiscal 2007 was primarily due to the introduction of over 60 new products and overall demand for our automotive products the aviation marine and outdoorfitness segments also experienced solid growth in 2007 total units sold increased 128 to 12300000 in 2007 from 5400000 in 2006 in general management believes that continuous innovation and the introduction of new products are essential for future revenue growth 

the increase in net sales to consumers was primarily due to the introduction of many new automotive outdoorfitness and marine products strong demand for our automotive products and solid demand for our aviation marine and outdoorfitness products it is management’s belief that the continued demand for the company’s automotive products is due to overall increased consumer awareness of the capabilities and applications of gps particularly as those capabilities pertain to automobile navigation additionally the expansion of the gps market in general as well as enhanced feature sets in our products specifically have added to our growth innovative new product offerings enhanced cartography rich feature sets and products featuring high sensitivity gps capabilities increased sales of our marine and outdoor fitness segments the increase in aviation sales for fiscal 2007 was primarily due to increased sales from panel mount products sold into the oem original equipment manufacturers and retrofit markets sales of the g1000 integrated glass cockpit were the primary reason for increased oem sales in 2006 while temporary flight restrictions tfrs continue to impact general aviation the flying community is adapting to these changes and returning to the skies in greater numbers should the faa impose more restrictions or elect to shutdown us airspace in the future these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business 

gross profit 

 

 

the increase in gross profit dollars was primarily attributable to the introduction of over 60 new products and strong demand for our automotive and outdoorfitness products the reduction in gross margin percentage was primarily due to the strong growth experienced in our lowermargin automotivemobile product line offset to some extent by strong gross margins in our other three segments notably gross margin in our automotivemobile segment did not fall as much as anticipated due to volume discounts on certain components less price competition than anticipated and new “premium” featurerich products with higher selling prices and margins management believes that the trend to lower gross margin percentages will continue in the future as net sales of automotive products increase at a faster rate than the other business segments the rise in aviation gross margin was primarily due to a shift in product mix within our oem and retrofit products the decline in gross margin in the outdoorfitness and marine segments was primarily due to a shift in product mix 

 

selling general and administrative expenses 

 

the increase in expense was primarily attributable to increases in employment generally across the organization significantly increased advertising costs up 80 associated primarily with massmarket advertising to increase brand awareness and promote our automotive products increased information technology staffing and support costs increased staffing in our sales and marketing group to increase focus on specific target markets and additional staffing in our customer call center management expects that because of strong demand for our products selling general and administrative expenses will rise in absolute dollars but decline as a percentage of sales during fiscal 2008 as increased advertising and marketing activities build awareness of the garmin brand and demand for garmin products worldwide 

research and development expenses 

 

the increase in research and development expense was primarily attributable to the addition of over 400 associates to our research and development team during fiscal 2007 management believes that one of the key strategic initiatives for future growth and success of garmin is continuous innovation development and introduction of new products management expects that its research and development expenses will increase approximately 3035 during fiscal 2008 on an absolute dollar basis due to the anticipated introduction of a strong portfolio of new products slated for fiscal 2008 management expects to continue to invest in the research and development of new products and technology in order to maintain garmin’s competitive advantage in the markets in which it competes 

other income expense 



other income expense principally consists of interest income interest expense and foreign currency exchange gains and losses other income expense was higher in fiscal 2007 relative to fiscal 2006 with the majority of this difference caused by increased interest income and a large foreign currency gain in 2007 interest income for fiscal 2007 increased due to higher interest rates and larger cash and marketable securities balances during the year increasing the returns on the company’s cash and cash equivalents 

foreign currency gains and losses for the company in 2007 were primarily tied to movements by the taiwan dollar the euro and the british pound sterling the us dollar remains the functional currency of garmin europe ltd the euro dollar is the functional currency of garmin france garmin deutschland garmin iberia and garmin italia as these entities grow euro currency moves will generate material gains and losses additionally eurobased intercompany transactions between garmin ltd and its subsidiaries can also generate currency gains and losses the canadian dollar is the functional currency of dynastream innovations inc due to this entity’s relative size its currency moves do not have a material impact on the company’s financial statements 

 

the majority of the 230 million currency gain in fiscal 2007 was due to the weakening of the us dollar compared to the euro and the british pound sterling during fiscal 2007 the taiwan dollar weakened relative to the us dollar resulting in a 25 million loss the british pound sterling and the euro strengthened 2 and 114 respectively relative to the us dollar during fiscal 2007 which resulted in a 256 million gain other net currency gains and the timing of transactions created the remaining loss of 01 million 

foreign currency gains and losses for the company in 2006 were primarily tied to movements by the taiwan dollar and the british pound sterling relative to the us dollar the us dollar weakened when compared to the taiwan dollar during fiscal 2006 creating a 30 million loss which was offset almost entirely by a 45 million gain as a result of strengthening in the us dollar relative to the british pound sterling other net currency gains and the timing of transactions created the remaining loss of 09 million 

income tax provision 

income tax expense increased by 429 million to 1233 million for fiscal year 2007 from 804 million for fiscal year 2006 due to our higher taxable income the effective tax rate was 126 for fiscal 2007 versus 135 for fiscal 2006 the decrease in tax rate is due to additional tax benefits received from taiwan as a result of our continued capital investment in our manufacturing facilities in taiwan tax credits resulting from our decision to repatriate certain of our taiwan earnings to our parent company and the increased contribution to our income from lower tax jurisdictions during 2007 relative to 2006 this lower effective tax rate resulted in a decrease in the ratio of income tax as a percentage of revenue of approximately 07 from fiscal 2006 to fiscal 2007 

 

net income 

as a result of the various factors noted above net income increased 66 to 8550 million for fiscal year 2007 compared to 5141 million for fiscal year 2006 

 

comparison of fiscal years ended december 30 2006 and december 31 2005 

net sales 

 

the increase in total net sales during fiscal 2006 was primarily due to the introduction of over 70 new products and overall demand for our automotive and outdoorfitness products total units sold increased 78 to 5400000 in 2006 from 3028000 in 2005 

garmin’s revenues are normally seasonal with the fiscal second and fourth quarter revenues being meaningfully higher than the first and third fiscal quarters in 2006 revenues followed this typical seasonal pattern with increases each quarter over the prior year’s quarter due to the impact of new product releases across all product lines the revenue increase in the second quarter was primarily attributable to sellin of popular new portable automobile navigation and outdoorfitness products and father’s daygraduation purchases the revenue increase in the fourth quarter was primarily attributable to late summer new product releases and sales associated with the traditional holiday selling season 

the increase in net sales to consumers was primarily due to the introduction of many new automotive outdoorfitness and marine products and overall demand for our automotive and outdoorfitness products it is management’s belief that the continued demand for the company’s automotive products is due to overall increased consumer awareness of the capabilities and applications of gps particularly as those capabilities pertain to automobile navigation additionally the expansion of the gps market in general as well as enhanced feature sets in our products specifically have added to our growth the increase in aviation sales for fiscal 2006 was primarily due to increased sales from panel mount products sold into the oem original equipment manufacturers and retrofit markets sales of the g1000 integrated glass cockpit were the primary reason for increased oem sales in 2006 

gross profit 

 

  the   increase in gross profit dollars was primarily attributable to the introduction of over 70 new products and strong demand for our automotive and outdoorfitness products the reduction in gross margin percentage was primarily due to the strong growth experienced in our lowermargin automotivemobile product line offset to some extent by strong gross margins in our other three segments notably gross margin in our automotivemobile segment did not fall as much as anticipated due to better than anticipated raw material cost reductions volume discounts on certain components less price competition than anticipated and new “premium” featurerich products with higher selling prices and margins management believes that the trend to lower gross margin percentages will continue in the future as net sales of automotive products increase at a faster rate than the other business segments the decline in aviation gross margin was primarily due to a shift in product mix within our oem and retrofit products and the delay of some anticipated oem and retrofit products 

 

selling general and administrative expenses 

 

 

the increase in expense was primarily attributable to increases in employment generally across the organization significantly increased advertising costs up 93 associated primarily with massmarket advertising to increase brand awareness and promote our automotive products increased information technology staffing and support costs increased staffing in our sales and marketing group to increase focus on specific target markets and additional staffing in our customer call center 

research and development expenses 

 

 

the increase in research and development expense was primarily attributable to the addition of over 250 associates to our research and development team during fiscal 2006 a key strategic initiative for future growth and success of garmin is continuous innovation development and introduction of new products which was facilitated by these additions to research and development staff 

other income expense 

 

 

other income expense principally consists of interest income interest expense and foreign currency exchange gains and losses other income expense was higher in fiscal 2006 relative to fiscal 2005 with the majority of this difference caused by increased interest income in 2006 interest income for fiscal 2006 increased due to higher interest rates and larger cash and marketable securities balances during the year increasing the returns on the company’s cash and cash equivalents 

during fiscal 2006 the company experienced foreign currency exchange gains of 06 million although the us dollar weakened slightly versus the taiwan dollar and british pound 3260 tdusd and 051 gbpusd relative to the end of fiscal 2005 3284 tdusd and 058 gbpusd during fiscal 2005 the company experienced foreign currency exchange gains of 153 million as the us dollar strengthened versus the taiwan dollar and british pound 3284 tdusd and 058 gbpusd relative to the end of fiscal 2004 3219 tdusd and 052 gbpusd 

 

 

income tax provision 

income tax expense increased by 190 million to 804 million for fiscal year 2006 from 614 million for fiscal year 2005 due to our higher taxable income the effective tax rate was 135 for fiscal 2006 versus 165 for fiscal 2005 the decrease in tax rate is due to additional tax benefits received from taiwan as a result of our continued capital investment in our manufacturing facilities in taiwan tax credits resulting from our decision to repatriate certain of our taiwan earnings to our parent company and the increased contribution to our income from lower tax jurisdictions during 2006 relative to 2005 this lower effective tax rate resulted in a decrease in the ratio of income tax as a percentage of revenue of approximately 14 from fiscal 2005 to fiscal 2006 

 

net income 

as a result of the various factors noted above net income increased 65 to 5141 million for fiscal year 2006 compared to 3112 million for fiscal year 2005 

 

liquidity and capital resources 

net cash generated by operations was 6821 million 3619 million and 2470 million for fiscal years 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively we operate with a customeroriented approach and seek to maintain sufficient inventory to meet customer demand because we desire to respond quickly to our customers and minimize order fulfillment time our inventory levels are generally substantial enough to meet most demand we also attempt to carry sufficient inventory levels of key components so that potential supplier shortages have as minimal an impact as possible on our ability to deliver our finished products we began implementing a more linear inventory management strategy in the fourth quarter of 2007 which management would anticipate will result in less inventory fluctuation from quarter to quarter going forward we prefer to have sufficient finished goods on hand to meet anticipated demand for our products raw materials and finished goods inventory levels continued to grow year over year as a function of our growing sales we anticipate days of inventory to stabilize at current levels in 2008 although absolute dollars of inventory will continue to rise reflecting the growth of our business 

capital expenditures in 2007 totaled 1568 million an increase of 639 million from fiscal 2006 this amount in 2007 reflects the purchase and buildout of an additional manufacturing facility in linkou taiwan continued expansion of research and development facilities in our taiwan facilities as well as ordinary capital expenditures for fiscal 2007 capital expenditures in 2006 totaled 929 million an increase of 658 million from fiscal 2005 this amount in 2006 reflects the purchase and renovation of an additional manufacturing facility in jhongli taiwan the purchase of a new european headquarters as well as ordinary capital expenditures for fiscal 2006 capital expenditures in 2005 totaled 271 million a decrease of 510 million from fiscal 2004 

we have budgeted approximately 115 million of capital expenditures during fiscal 2008 to include normal ongoing capital expenditures as well as purchases of production machinery and equipment to expand capacity in the linkou taiwan facility 

in addition to capital expenditures in 2007 cash flow used in investing related to the purchase of digital cyclone inc garmin france sas garmin deutschland gmbh garmin iberia sa garmin italia spa and the assets of nautamatic marine systems inc for a total of 1288 million the net sale of 1128 million of fixed income securities associated with the investment of our onhand cash balances and the purchase of 29 million of intangible assets garmin’s average return on its investments during fiscal 2007 was approximately 43 in addition to capital expenditures in 2006 cash flow used in investing related to the purchase of dynastream innovations inc for 365 million the net purchase of 938 million of fixed income securities associated with the investment of our onhand cash balances and the purchase of 31 million of intangible assets garmin’s average return on its investments during fiscal 2006 was approximately 47 in addition to capital expenditures in 2005 cash flow used in investing related to the net purchase of 591 million of fixed income securities associated with the investment of our onhand cash balances and approximately 36 million of intangible assets garmin’s average return on its investments during fiscal 2005 was approximately 31 it is management’s goal to invest the onhand cash consistent with garmin’s investment policy which has been approved by the board of directors the investment policy’s primary purpose is to preserve capital maintain an acceptable degree of liquidity and maximize yield within the constraint of low credit risk 

 

cash flow related to financing activities resulted in a net use of cash in 2007 of 1361 million during 2007 garmin repurchased 57235 shares of its common shares under the 3000000share stock repurchase program that was approved by the board of directors on august 3 2006 and expired on december 31 2007 a new 5000000 share repurchase plan was authorized in february 2008 which expires on december 31 2009 sources and uses in financing activities during 2007 related primarily to a use for the payment of a dividend 1625 million and the purchase of stock 142 million and a source of cash from the issuance of common stock related to the exercise of employee stock options the related tax benefit and the employee stock purchase plan 408 million cash flow related to financing activities resulted in a net use of cash in 2006 of 1327 million during 2006 garmin repurchased 1155300 shares of its common shares under the 3000000share stock repurchase program that was approved by the board of directors on august 3 2006 and expired on december 31 2007 sources and uses in financing activities during 2006 related primarily to uses for the payment of a dividend 1079 million and stock repurchase 505 million and a source of cash from the issuance of common stock related to the exercise of employee stock options the related tax benefit and the employee stock purchase plan 257 million cash flow related to financing activities resulted in a net use of cash in 2005 of 709 million during 2005 garmin repurchased 638000 shares of its common shares under the 3000000share stock repurchase program that was approved by the board of directors on april 21 2004 and expired on april 30 2006 sources and uses in financing activities during 2005 related primarily to uses for the payment of a dividend 540 million and stock repurchase 267 million and a source of cash from the issuance of common shares related to the exercise of employee stock options the related tax benefit and the employee stock purchase plan 97 million 

cash dividends paid to shareholders were 1625 million 1079 million and 540 million during fiscal years 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively 

we believe that our existing cash balances and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our projected capital expenditures working capital and other cash requirements at least through the end of fiscal 2010 

 

contractual obligations and commercial commitments 

future commitments of garmin as of december 29 2007 aggregated by type of contractual obligation are 

 

operating leases describes lease obligations associated with garmin facilities located in the us taiwan the uk and canada purchase obligations are the aggregate of those purchase orders that were outstanding on december 29 2007 these obligations are created and then paid off within 3 months during the normal course of our manufacturing business 

 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we do not have any offbalance sheet arrangements 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market sensitivity 

 

we have market risk primarily in connection with the pricing of our products and services and the purchase of raw materials product pricing and raw materials costs are both significantly influenced by semiconductor market conditions historically during cyclical industry downturns we have been able to offset pricing declines for our products through a combination of improved product mix and success in obtaining price reductions in raw materials costs 

inflation 

we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our business financial condition or results of operations if our costs were to become subject to significant inflationary pressures we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs through price increases our inability or failure to do so could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

the operation of garmin’s subsidiaries in international markets results in exposure to movements in currency exchange rates we generally have not been significantly affected by foreign exchange fluctuations because the taiwan dollar the euro and british pound have proven to be relatively stable however periodically we have experienced significant foreign currency gains and losses due to the strengthening and weakening of the us dollar the potential of volatile foreign exchange rate fluctuations in the future could have a significant effect on our results of operations 

the currencies that create a majority of the company’s exchange rate exposure are the taiwan dollar the euro and british pound garmin corporation located in shijr taiwan uses the local currency as the functional currency the company translates all assets and liabilities at yearend exchange rates and income and expense accounts at average rates during the year in order to minimize the effect of the currency exchange fluctuations on our net assets we have elected to retain most of our taiwan subsidiary’s cash and investments in marketable securities denominated in us dollars the ntdusd exchange rate decreased 03 during 2007 which resulted in a cumulative translation adjustment of negative 03 million at the end of fiscal 2007 and a net foreign currency loss of 25 million at garmin corporation during 2007 

garmin france sas garmin deutschland gmbh garmin italia spa and garmin iberia sa located in france germany italy and spain respectively use the euro as the functional currency  however the functional currency of our largest european subsidiary garmin europe ltd remains the us dollar and as some transactions occurred in british pounds or euros foreign currency gains or losses have been realized historically related to the movements of those currencies relative to the us dollar the company believes that gains and losses will become more material in the future as our european presence grows in 2007 the euro strengthened 102 relative to the us dollar and the british pound sterling strengthened 17 relative to the us dollar these currency moves resulted in a foreign currency gain of 256 million in garmin ltd and our european subsidiaries these gains were offset by currency moves in the taiwan dollar that generated losses described above combined with other losses of 01 million and the timing of transactions during the year for a net gain of 230 million for the company 

if the tdusd exchange rate had decreased 10 and the gbpusd and eurusd exchange rate had each increased 10 in 2007 the cumulative translation adjustment would have been a negative 04 million at the end of fiscal 2007 and the foreign currency loss would have been 1095 million without the use of any hedging strategies 

 

 

interest rate risk 

we have no outstanding longterm debt as of december 29 2007 we therefore have no meaningful debtrelated interest rate risk 

we are exposed to interest rate risk in connection with our investments in marketable securities as interest rates change the unrealized gains and losses associated with those securities will fluctuate accordingly a hypothetical change of 10 in interest rates would not have a material effect on such unrealized gains or losses at december 29 2007 cumulative unrealized gains on those securities were 464 million 

equity price risk

company overview 

garmin is a leading worldwide provider of navigation communications and information devices most of which are enabled by global positioning system “gps” technology garmin designs develops manufactures and markets a diverse family of handheld portable and fixedmount gpsenabled products and other navigation communications and information products for the automotivemobile outdoorfitness marine and general aviation markets 

overview of the global positioning system 

the global positioning system is a worldwide navigation system which enables the precise determination of geographic location using established satellite technology the system consists of a constellation of orbiting satellites the satellites and their ground control and monitoring stations are maintained and operated by the united states department of defense which maintains an ongoing satellite replenishment program to ensure continuous global system coverage access to the system is provided free of charge by the us government 

prior to may 2000 the us department of defense intentionally degraded the accuracy of civilian gps signals in a process known as selective availability ‘‘sa’’ for national security purposes sa variably degraded gps position accuracy to a radius of 100 meters on may 2 2000 the us department of defense discontinued sa in a presidential policy statement issued in december 2004 the bush administration indicated that the us does not intend to implement sa again and is committed to preventing hostile use of gps through regional denial of service minimizing the impact to peaceful users with sa removed a gps receiver can calculate its position to an accuracy of approximately 10 meters or less enhancing the utility of gps for most applications 

the accuracy and utility of gps can be enhanced through augmentation techniques which compute any remaining errors in the signal and broadcast these corrections to a gps device the federal aviation administration “faa” has developed a wide area augmentation system ‘‘waas’’ comprising ground reference stations and additional satellites that improve the accuracy of gps positioning available in the united states and portions of canada and mexico to approximately 3 meters waas supports the use of gps as the primary means of enroute terminal and approach navigation for aviation in the united states the increased accuracy offered by waas also enhances the utility of waasenabled gps receivers for consumer applications the faa announced on july 11 2003 that the waas system had achieved initial operating capability and that the system was available for instrument flight use with appropriately certified avionics equipment since that time the faa has installed additional ground reference stations and has launched additional waas satellites

below is a table of garmin’s expenditures on research and development over the last three fiscal years 

 

manufacturing and operations 

garmin believes that one of its core competencies is its manufacturing capability at its shijr and jhongli taiwan facilities its olathe kansas facility and its salem oregon facility garmin believes that its vertically integrated approach has provided it the following benefits 

reduced timetomarket utilizing concurrent engineering techniques garmin’s products are introduced to production at an early development stage and the feedback provided by manufacturing is incorporated into the design before mass production begins in this manner garmin attempts to reduce the time required to move a product from its design phase to mass production deliveries with improved quality and yields reducing time to market has enabled garmin to offer several industry firsts such as the rino gpsenabled family radio servicegeneral mobile radio service twoway radio the ique 3600a portable digital assistant with integrated gps and mapping and the gns 430 which integrates traditional aviation navigation and communications systems with gps in a single package 

design and process optimization garmin uses its manufacturing resources to rapidly prototype design concepts products and processes in order to achieve higher efficiency lower cost and better value for customers garmin’s ability to fully explore product design and manufacturing process concepts has enabled it to optimize its designs to minimize size and weight in gps devices that are functional waterproof and rugged 

logistical agility operating its own manufacturing facilities helps garmin minimize problems such as component shortages and long component lead times which are common in the electronics industry many products can be reengineered to bypass component shortages or reduce cost and the new designs can be delivered to market quickly garmin reacts rapidly to changes in market demand by striving to maintain a safety stock of longlead components and by rescheduling components from one product line to another 

garmin’s design manufacturing distribution and servicing processes in our us taiwan and uk facilities are certified to iso 90012000 an international quality standard developed by the international organization for standardization garmin’s taiwan manufacturing facilities have also achieved ts 169492002 certification a quality standard for automotive suppliers in addition garmin’s aviation panelmount products are designed and manufactured according to processes which are approved and monitored by the faa 

in january 2007 garmin’s taiwan facilities also achieved certification of their environmental management systems to the iso140011994 standard this certification recognizes that garmin’s taiwan subsidiary has systems and processes in place to minimize or prevent harmful effects on the environment and to strive continually to improve its environmental performance 

materials 

garmin purchases components for its products from a number of suppliers around the world for certain components garmin relies on sole source suppliers the failure of our suppliers to deliver components in sufficient quantities and in a timely manner could adversely affect our business 

seasonality 

our sales are subject to some seasonal fluctuation typically sales of our consumer products are highest in the second quarter due to increased demand during the spring and summer marine season and the father’s daygraduation buying season and in the fourth quarter due to increased demand during the holiday buying season sales of consumer products are also influenced by the timing of the release of new products our aviation products do not experience much seasonal variation but are more influenced by the timing of the release of new products when the initial demand is typically the strongest 

backlog 

our sales are generally of a consumer nature and there is a relatively short cycle between order and shipment therefore we believe that backlog information is not material to the understanding of our business we typically ship most orders within 72 hours of receipt 

intellectual property 

our success and ability to compete is dependent in part on our proprietary technology we rely on a combination of patent copyright trademark and trade secret laws as well as confidentiality agreements to establish and protect our proprietary rights as of february 26 2007 we held 291 us patents and 13 foreign patents as of february 26 2007 we had 190 us patent applications and 26 foreign patent applications pending in addition garmin often relies on licenses of intellectual property for use in its business for example garmin obtains licenses for digital cartography technology for use in our products from various sources as of february 26 2007 we held 68 us trademark registrations and 135 foreign trademark registrations additional trademarks are pending registration 

we believe that our continued success depends on the intellectual skills of our employees and their ability to continue to innovate garmin will continue to file and prosecute patent applications when appropriate to attempt to protect garmin’s rights in its proprietary technologies 

there is no assurance that our current patents or patents which we may later acquire may successfully withstand any challenge in whole or in part it is also possible that any patent issued to us may not provide us with any competitive advantages or that the patents of others will preclude us from manufacturing and marketing certain products despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights to protect its trade secrets to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others or to defend against claims of infringement or invalidity 

regulations 

the telecommunications industry is highly regulated and the regulatory environment in which garmin operates is subject to change in accordance with federal communication commission “fcc” rules and regulations wireless transceiver and cellular handset products are required to be certified by the fcc and comparable authorities in foreign countries where they are sold garmin’s products sold in europe are required to comply with relevant directives of the european commission a delay in receiving required certifications for new products or enhancements to garmin’s products or losing certification for garmin’s existing products could adversely affect our business in addition aviation products that are intended for installation in “type certificated aircraft” are required to be certified by the faa its european counterpart the european aviation safety agency and other comparable organizations before they can be used in an aircraft 

because garmin corporation one of the company’s principal subsidiaries is located in taiwan foreign exchange control laws and regulations of taiwan with respect to remittances into and out of taiwan may have an impact on garmin’s operations the taiwan foreign exchange control statute and regulations thereunder provide that all foreign exchange transactions must be executed by banks designated to handle such business by the ministry of finance of taiwan and by the central bank of china also referred to as the cbc current regulations favor traderelated foreign exchange transactions consequently foreign currency earned from exports of merchandise and services may now be retained and used freely by exporters while all foreign currency needed for the import of merchandise and services may be purchased freely from the designated foreign exchange banks aside from traderelated foreign exchange transactions taiwan companies and residents may without foreign exchange approval remit outside and into taiwan foreign currencies of up to 50 million and 5 million respectively or their equivalent each calendar year currency conversions within the limits are processed by the designated banks and do not have to be reviewed and approved by the cbc the above limits apply to remittances involving a conversion between new taiwan dollars and us dollars or other foreign currencies the cbc typically approves foreign exchange in excess of the limits if a party applies with the cbc for review and presents legitimate business reasons justifying the currency conversion a requirement is also imposed on all enterprises to register all medium and longterm foreign debt with the cbc 

environmental matters 

the european union “eu” has enacted the restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment directive rohs directive and the waste electrical and electronic equipment directive “weee directive” the rohs directive requires eu member states to enact laws prohibiting the use of certain substances including lead mercury cadmium and hexavalent chromium in certain electronic products put on the market after july 1 2006 the weee directive requires eu member states to enact laws that were to go into effect by august 13 2005 regulating the collection recovery and recycling of waste from certain electronic products we have established a program in order to comply with such laws and regulations as they are enacted by the eu member states we have modified the design of our products and our manufacturing processes in order to comply with such laws and regulations 

the people’s republic of china has enacted legislation which is widely known as “china rohs” the first phase of china rohs will take effect on march 1 2007 and will require the disclosure and marking of certain substances including lead mercury cadmium and hexavalent chromium in certain electronic products we have established a program in order to comply with the first phase of china rohs 

the state of california has enacted legislation similar to the rohs directive and other states and countries have promulgated or proposed legislation similar to the rohs directive andor the weee directive the need for and cost of our compliance with such legislation cannot yet be determined but the cost could be substantial 

several states have enacted laws pertaining to the reduction of mercury in products and the labeling of mercurycontaining products including the member states of the interstate mercury education and reduction clearinghouse imerc some of these laws including those in connecticut new york vermont and louisiana are applicable to certain of garmin’s gps products we have established an ongoing compliance program to ensure that we are fulfilling the notice and labeling requirements set forth in the relevant mercury legislation 

portable garmin products which use acdc adapters as an option for battery charging would require submissions of energyuse profiles if and when the future implementing measures resulting from the eu eup energy using products directive define such products as being within their scope 

employees 

as of december 30 2006 garmin had 4751 fulltime employees worldwide of whom 1728 were in the united states 53 were in canada 2807 were in taiwan 160 were in europe and 3 were in other global locations none of garmin’s employees are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement garmin considers its employee relations to be good 

 




 item 1a risk factors 

the risks described below are not the only ones facing our company additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also impair our business operations if any of the following risks occur our business financial condition or operating results could be materially adversely affected 

risks related to the company 

our global positioning system products depend upon satellites maintained by the united states department of defense if a significant number of these satellites become inoperable unavailable or are not replaced or if the policies of the united states government for the use of the global positioning system without charge are changed or if there is interference with global positioning system signals our business will suffer 

the global positioning system is a satellitebased navigation and positioning system consisting of a constellation of orbiting satellites the satellites and their ground control and monitoring stations are maintained and operated by the united states department of defense the department of defense does not currently charge users for access to the satellite signals these satellites and their ground support systems are complex electronic systems subject to electronic and mechanical failures and possible sabotage the satellites were originally designed to have lives of 75 years and are subject to damage by the hostile space environment in which they operate however of the current deployment of satellites in place some have been operating for more than 13 years 

if a significant number of satellites were to become inoperable unavailable or are not replaced it would impair the current utility of our global positioning system products and would have a material negative effect on our business in addition there can be no assurance that the us government will remain committed to the operation and maintenance of global positioning system satellites over a long period or that the policies of the us government that provide for the use of the global positioning system without charge and without accuracy degradation will remain unchanged because of the increasing commercial applications of the global positioning system other us government agencies may become involved in the administration or the regulation of the use of global positioning system signals however in a presidential policy statement issued in december 2004 the bush administration indicated that the us is committed to supporting and improving the global positioning system and will continue providing it free from direct user fees 

some of our products also use signals from systems that augment gps such as the wide area augmentation system waas waas is operated by the federal aviation administration faa any curtailment of the operating capability of waas could result in decreased user capability for many of our aviation products thereby impacting our markets 

any of the foregoing factors could affect the willingness of buyers of our products to select global positioning systembased products instead of products based on competing technologies 

a shut down of us airspace or imposition of restrictions on general aviation would harm our business 

on september 11 2001 terrorists hijacked and crashed four passenger aircraft operated by commercial air carriers resulting in major loss of life and property following the terrorist attacks the faa ordered all aircraft operating in the us to be grounded for several days in addition to this shut down of us airspace the general aviation industry was further impacted by the additional restrictions implemented by the faa on those flights that fly utilizing visual flight rules vfr the faa restricted vfr flight inside 30 enhanced class b a 2025 mile radius around the 30 largest metropolitan areas in the usa airspace areas the aircraft owners and pilots association aopa estimated that these restrictions affected approximately 41800 general aviation aircraft based at 282 airports inside the 30 enhanced class b airspace areas the aopa estimates that approximately 90 of all general aviation flights are conducted vfr and that only 15 of general aviation pilots are current to fly utilizing instrument flight rules ifr 

the shut down of us airspace following september 11 2001 caused reduced sales of our general aviation products and delays in the shipment of our products manufactured in our taiwan manufacturing facility to our distribution facility in olathe kansas thereby adversely affecting our ability to supply new and existing products to our dealers and distributors 

any future shut down of us airspace or imposition of restrictions on general aviation could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results 

any reallocation of radio frequency spectrum could cause interference with the reception of global positioning system signals this interference could harm our business 

our global positioning system technology is dependent on the use of the standard positioning service sps provided by the us government’s global positioning system satellites the global positioning system operates in radio frequency bands that are globally allocated for radio navigation satellite services the assignment of spectrum is controlled by an international organization known as the international telecommunications union ‘‘itu’’ the federal communications commission ‘‘fcc’’ is responsible for the assignment of spectrum for nongovernment use in the united states in accordance with itu regulations any itu or fcc reallocation of radio frequency spectrum including frequency band segmentation or sharing of spectrum could cause interference with the reception of global positioning system signals and may materially and adversely affect the utility and reliability of our products which would in turn have a material adverse effect on our operating results in addition emissions from mobile satellite service and other equipment operating in adjacent frequency bands or inband may materially and adversely affect the utility and reliability of our products which could result in a material adverse effect on our operating results the fcc continually receives proposals for new technologies and services such as ultrawideband technologies which may seek to operate in or across the radio frequency bands currently used by the gps sps adverse decisions by the fcc that result in harmful interference to the delivery of the gps sps may materially and adversely affect the utility and reliability of our products which could result in a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition 

if we are not successful in the continued development introduction or timely manufacture of new products demand for our products could decrease 

we expect that a significant portion of our future revenue will continue to be derived from sales of newly introduced products the market for our products is characterized by rapidly changing technology evolving industry standards and changes in customer needs if we fail to introduce new products or to modify or improve our existing products in response to changes in technology industry standards or customer needs our products could rapidly become less competitive or obsolete we must continue to make significant investments in research and development in order to continue to develop new products enhance existing products and achieve market acceptance for such products however there can be no assurance that development stage products will be successfully completed or if developed will achieve significant customer acceptance 

if we are unable to successfully develop and introduce competitive new products and enhance our existing products our future results of operations would be adversely affected our pursuit of necessary technology may require substantial time and expense we may need to license new technologies to respond to technological change these licenses may not be available to us on terms that we can accept or may materially change the gross profits that we are able to obtain on our products we may not succeed in adapting our products to new technologies as they emerge development and manufacturing schedules for technology products are difficult to predict and there can be no assurance that we will achieve timely initial customer shipments of new products the timely availability of these products in volume and their acceptance by customers are important to our future success from time to time we have experienced delays in shipping certain of our new products and any future delays whether due to product development delays manufacturing delays lack of market acceptance delays in regulatory approval or otherwise could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

if we do not correctly anticipate demand for our products we may not be able to secure sufficient quantities or costeffective production of our products or we could have costly excess production or inventories 

historically we have experienced steady increases in demand for our products although we did experience a decline in demand for our aviation products in 2001 due to declining economic conditions and the shut down of us airspace as a result of the terrorist attacks that occurred on september 11 2001 we have generally been able to increase production to meet this increasing demand however the demand for our products depends on many factors and will be difficult to forecast we expect that it will become more difficult to forecast demand as we introduce and support multiple products and as competition in the market for our products intensifies significant unanticipated fluctuations in demand could cause the following problems in our operations 

 

 

 

we may become subject to significant product liability costs 

if our aviation products malfunction or contain errors or defects airplane collisions or crashes could occur resulting in property damage personal injury or death malfunctions or errors or defects in our marine navigational products could cause boats to run aground or cause other wreckage personal injury or death if any of these events occurs we could be subject to significant liability for personal injury and property damage and under certain circumstances could be subject to a judgment for punitive damages we maintain insurance against accidentrelated risks involving our products however there can be no assurance that such insurance would be sufficient to cover the cost of damages to others or that such insurance will continue to be available at commercially reasonable rates in addition insurance coverage generally will not cover awards of punitive damages if we are unable to maintain sufficient insurance to cover product liability costs or if our insurance coverage does not cover the award this could have a materially adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we depend on our suppliers some of which are the sole source for specific components and our production would be seriously harmed if these suppliers are not able to meet our demand and alternative sources are not available or if the costs of components rise 

we are dependent on third party suppliers for various components used in our current products some of the components that we procure from third party suppliers include semiconductors and electroluminescent panels liquid crystal displays memory chips and microprocessors the cost quality and availability of components are essential to the successful production and sale of our products some components we use are from sole source suppliers certain applicationspecific integrated circuits incorporating our proprietary designs are manufactured for us by sole source suppliers alternative sources may not be currently available for these sole source components 

in the past including in the first half of 2004 we have experienced shortages of liquid crystal displays and other components in addition if there are shortages in supply of components the costs of such components may rise if suppliers are unable to meet our demand for components on a timely basis and if we are unable to obtain an alternative source or if the price of the alternative source is prohibitive or if the costs of components rise our ability to maintain timely and costeffective production of our products would be seriously harmed 

we license mapping data for use in our products from various sources there are only a limited number of suppliers of mapping data for each geographical region if we are unable to continue licensing such mapping data and are unable to obtain an alternative source or if the price of the alternative source is prohibitive our ability to supply mapping data for use in our products would be seriously harmed 

we rely on independent dealers and distributors to sell our products and disruption to these channels would harm our business 

because we sell a majority of our products to independent dealers and distributors we are subject to many risks including risks related to their inventory levels and support for our products in particular our dealers and distributors maintain significant levels of our products in their inventories if dealers and distributors attempt to reduce their levels of inventory or if they do not maintain sufficient levels to meet customer demand our sales could be negatively impacted 

many of our dealers and distributors also sell products offered by our competitors if our competitors offer our dealers and distributors more favorable terms those dealers and distributors may deemphasize or decline to carry our products in the future we may not be able to retain or attract a sufficient number of qualified dealers and distributors if we are unable to maintain successful relationships with dealers and distributors or to expand our distribution channels our business will suffer 

failure to manage our growth and expansion effectively could adversely impact our business 

our ability to successfully offer our products and implement our business plan in a rapidly evolving market requires an effective planning and management process we continue to increase the scope of our operations domestically and internationally and have grown our shipments and headcount substantially this growth has placed and our anticipated growth in future operations will continue to place a significant strain on our management systems and resources 

our business may suffer if we are not able to hire and retain sufficient qualified personnel or if we lose our key personnel 

our future success depends partly on the continued contribution of our key executive engineering sales marketing manufacturing and administrative personnel we currently do not have employment agreements with any of our key executive officers we do not have key man life insurance on any of our key executive officers and do not currently intend to obtain such insurance the loss of the services of any of our senior level management or other key employees could harm our business recruiting and retaining the skilled personnel we require to maintain our market position may be difficult for example in some recent years there has been a nationwide shortage of qualified electrical engineers and software engineers who are necessary for us to design and develop new products and therefore it has sometimes been challenging to recruit such personnel if we fail to hire and retain qualified employees we may not be able to maintain and expand our business 

gross margins for our products may fluctuate or erode 

gross margins on our automotivemobile products have been declining due to price reductions in the increasingly competitive market for personal navigation devices pnds we expect that gross margins on automotivemobile products will continue to erode in addition our overall gross margin may fluctuate from period to period due to a number of factors including product mix competition and unit volumes in particular the average selling prices of a specific product tend to decrease over that product’s life to offset such decreases we intend to rely primarily on obtaining yield improvements and corresponding cost reductions in the manufacture of existing products and on introducing new products that incorporate advanced features and therefore can be sold at higher average selling prices however there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain any such yield improvements or cost reductions or introduce any such new products in the future to the extent that such cost reductions and new product introductions do not occur in a timely manner or our products do not achieve market acceptance our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

our quarterly operating results are subject to fluctuations and seasonality 

our operating results are difficult to predict our future quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly if such operating results decline the price of our stock would likely decline as we expand our operations our operating expenses particularly our advertising and research and development costs may increase as a percentage of our sales if revenues decrease and we are unable to reduce those costs rapidly our operating results would be negatively affected 

historically our revenues have usually been weaker in the first and third quarters of each fiscal year and have from time to time been lower than the preceding quarter our devices are highly consumeroriented and consumer buying is traditionally lower in these quarters sales of certain of our marine and automotive   products tend to be higher in our second fiscal quarter due to increased consumer spending for such products during the recreational marine fishing and travel season sales of our automotivemobile products also tend to be higher in our fourth fiscal quarter due to increased consumer spending patterns on electronic devices during the holiday season   in addition we attempt to time our new product releases to coincide with relatively higher consumer spending in the second and fourth fiscal quarters which contributes to these seasonal variations 

our quarterly financial statements will reflect fluctuations in foreign currency translation 

our taiwan subsidiary holds and is expected to continue to hold significant cash cash equivalents and marketable securities and receivables denominated in us dollars because the us dollar is the primary currency for our business and in order to substantially reduce the economic consequence of any variation in the exchange rate for the us dollar and the new taiwan dollar on these assets management expects that the taiwan subsidiary will continue to hold the majority of these assets in us dollar or us dollar denominated instruments nonetheless us gaap requires the company at the end of each accounting period to translate into new taiwan dollars all such us dollar denominated assets held by our taiwan subsidiary this translation is required because the new taiwan dollar is the functional currency of the subsidiary this us gaapmandated translation will cause us to recognize gain or loss on our financial statements as the new taiwan dollarus dollar exchange rate varies such gain or loss will create variations in our earnings per share because there is minimal cash impact caused by such exchange rate variations management will continue to focus on the company’s operating performance before the impact of the foreign currency translation 

if we are unable to compete effectively with existing or new competitors our resulting loss of competitive position could result in price reductions fewer customer orders reduced margins and loss of market share 

the markets for our products are highly competitive and we expect competition to increase in the future some of our competitors have significantly greater financial technical and marketing resources than we do these competitors may be able to respond more rapidly to new or emerging technologies or changes in customer requirements they may also be able to devote greater resources to the development promotion and sale of their products increased competition could result in price reductions fewer customer orders reduced margins and loss of market share our failure to compete successfully against current or future competitors could seriously harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

our intellectual property rights are important to our operations and we could suffer loss if they infringe upon other’s rights or are infringed upon by others 

we rely on a combination of patents copyrights trademarks and trade secrets confidentiality provisions and licensing arrangements to establish and protect our proprietary rights to this end we hold rights to a number of patents and registered trademarks and regularly file applications to attempt to protect our rights in new technology and trademarks however there is no guarantee that our patent applications will become issued patents or that our trademark applications will become registered trademarks moreover even if approved our patents or trademarks may thereafter be successfully challenged by others or otherwise become invalidated for a variety of reasons thus any patents or trademarks we currently have or may later acquire may not provide us a significant competitive advantage 

third parties may claim that we are infringing their intellectual property rights such claims could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition from time to time we receive letters alleging infringement of patents litigation concerning patents or other intellectual property is costly and time consuming we may seek licenses from such parties but they could refuse to grant us a license or demand commercially unreasonable terms we might not have sufficient resources to pay for the licenses such infringement claims could also cause us to incur substantial liabilities and to suspend or permanently cease the use of critical technologies or processes or the production or sale of major products 

failure to obtain required certifications of our products on a timely basis could harm our business 

we have certain products especially in our aviation segment that are subject to governmental and similar certifications before they can be sold for example federal aviation administration ‘‘faa’’ certification is required for all of our aviation products that are intended for installation in type certificated aircraft to the extent required certification is an expensive and timeconsuming process that requires significant focus and resources an inability to obtain or excessive delay in obtaining such certifications could have an adverse effect on our ability to introduce new products and therefore our operating results   in addition we cannot assure you that our certified products will not be decertified any such decertification could have an adverse effect on our operating results 

our business is subject to economic political and other risks associated with international sales and operations 

our business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally we estimate that approximately 38 of our net sales in the fiscal year ended december 30 2006 represented products shipped to international destinations accordingly our business financial condition and results of operations could be harmed by a variety of international factors including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we may experience unique economic and political risks associated with companies that operate in taiwan 

relations between taiwan and the people’s republic of china also referred to as the prc and other factors affecting the political or economic conditions of taiwan in the future could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations and the market price and the liquidity of our shares our principal manufacturing facilities where we manufacture all of our products except our panelmounted aviation products are located in taiwan 

taiwan has a unique international political status the prc asserts sovereignty over all of china including taiwan certain other islands and all of mainland china the prc government does not recognize the legitimacy of the taiwan government although significant economic and cultural relations have been established during recent years between taiwan and the prc the prc government has indicated that it may use military force to gain control over taiwan in certain circumstances such as the declaration of independence by taiwan relations between taiwan and the prc have on occasion adversely affected the market value of taiwanese companies and could negatively affect our operations in taiwan in the future 

there is uncertainty as to our shareholders’ ability to enforce certain foreign civil liabilities in the cayman islands and taiwan 

we are a cayman islands company and a substantial portion of our assets are located outside the united states particularly in taiwan as a result it may be difficult to effect service of process within the united states upon us in addition there is uncertainty as to whether the courts of the cayman islands or taiwan would recognize or enforce judgments of united states courts obtained against us predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the united states or any state thereof or be competent to hear original actions brought in the cayman islands or taiwan against us predicated upon the securities laws of the united states or any state thereof 

our shareholders may face difficulties in protecting their interests because we are incorporated under cayman islands law 

our corporate affairs are governed by our memorandum and articles of association as amended and by the companies law 2004 revision and the common law of the cayman islands the rights of our shareholders and the fiduciary responsibilities of our directors under cayman islands law are not as clearly established as under statutes or judicial precedent in existence in jurisdictions in the united states therefore you may have more difficulty in protecting your interests in the face of actions by the management directors or our controlling shareholders than would shareholders of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction in the united states due to the comparatively less developed nature of cayman islands law in this area 

unlike many jurisdictions in the united states cayman islands law does not specifically provide for shareholder appraisal rights on a merger or consolidation of a company this may make it more difficult for you to assess the value of any consideration you may receive in a merger or consolidation or to require that the offeror give you additional consideration if you believe the consideration offered is insufficient 

shareholders of cayman islands exempted companies such as ourselves have no general rights under cayman islands law to inspect corporate records and accounts or to obtain copies of lists of shareholders of the company this may make it more difficult for you to obtain the information needed to establish any facts necessary for a shareholder motion or to solicit proxies from other shareholders in connection with a proxy contest 

subject to limited exceptions under cayman islands law a minority shareholder may not bring a derivative action against the board of directors our cayman islands counsel has advised that they are not aware of any reported class action or derivative action having been brought in a cayman islands court 

we may pursue strategic acquisitions investments strategic partnerships or other ventures and our business could be materially harmed if we fail to successfully identify complete and integrate such transactions 

we intend to evaluate acquisition opportunities and opportunities to make investments in complementary businesses technologies services or products or to enter into any strategic partnerships with parties who can provide access to those assets additional product or services offerings or additional industry expertise in december 2006 we acquired dynastream innovations inc in january 2007 we acquired digital cyclone inc and eme tecsat sas we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition investment or strategic partnership candidates or if we do identify suitable candidates in the future we may not be able to complete those transactions on commercially favorable terms or at all 

any future acquisition could result in difficulties assimilating acquired operations and products and diversion of capital and management’s attention away from other business issues and opportunities integration of acquired companies may result in problems related to integration of technology and inexperienced management teams in addition the key personnel of the acquired company may decide not to work for us our management has had limited experience in assimilating acquired organizations and products into our operations we may not successfully integrate internal controls compliance under the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 and other corporate governance matters operations personnel or products related to acquisitions we may make in the future if we fail to successfully integrate such transactions our business could be materially harmed 

we have benefited in the past from taiwan government tax incentives offered on certain high technology capital investments that may not always be available 

our effective tax rate is lower than the us federal statutory rate because we have benefited from incentives offered in taiwan related to our high technology investments in taiwan the loss of these tax benefits could have a significant effect on our financial results in the future 

changes in our united states federal income tax classification or in applicable tax law could result in adverse tax consequences to our shareholders 

we do not believe that we or any of our nonunited states subsidiaries are currently a ‘‘passive foreign investment company’’ for united states federal income tax purposes we do not expect to become a passive foreign investment company however because the passive foreign investment company determination is made annually on the basis of facts and circumstances that may be beyond our control and because the principles for applying the passive foreign investment company tests are not entirely clear we cannot assure that we will not become a passive foreign investment company if we are a passive foreign investment company in any year then any of our shareholders that is a united states person could be liable to pay tax at ordinary income tax rates plus an interest charge upon some distributions by us or when that shareholder sells our common shares at a gain further if we are classified as a passive foreign investment company in any year in which a united states person is a shareholder we generally will continue to be treated as a passive foreign investment company with respect to such shareholder in all succeeding years regardless of whether we continue to satisfy the income or asset tests described above additional tax considerations would apply if we or any of our subsidiaries were a controlled foreign corporation 

 

risks relating to our shares 

 

the volatility of our stock price could adversely affect investment in our common shares 

the market price of our common shares has been and may continue to be highly volatile during 2006 the closing price of our common shares ranged from a low of 2975 to a high of 5689 a variety of factors could cause the price of our common shares to fluctuate perhaps substantially including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in addition in recent years the stock market in general and the markets for shares of technology companies in particular have experienced extreme price fluctuations which have often been unrelated to the operating performance of affected companies any such fluctuations in the future could adversely affect the market price of our common shares and the market price of our common shares may decline 

 

our officers and directors exert substantial influence over us 

as of february 15 2007 members and former members of our board of directors and our executive officers together with members of their families and entities that may be deemed affiliates of or related to such persons or entities beneficially owned approximately 41 of our outstanding common shares  accordingly these shareholders may be able to determine the outcome of corporate actions requiring shareholder approval such as mergers and acquisitions this level of ownership may have a significant effect in delaying deferring or preventing a change in control of garmin and may adversely affect the voting and other rights of other holders of our common shares 

provisions in our shareholder rights plan and our charter documents might deter delay or prevent a third party from acquiring us and cayman islands corporate law may impede a takeover which could decrease the value of our shares 

our board of directors has the authority to issue up to 1000000 preferred shares and to determine the price rights preferences privileges and restrictions including voting rights of those shares without any further vote or action by the shareholders this could have an adverse impact on the market price of our common shares we have no present plans to issue any preferred shares but we may do so the rights of the holders of common shares may be subject to and adversely affected by the rights of the holders of any preferred shares that may be issued in the future in addition we have adopted a classified board of directors our shareholders are unable to remove any director or the entire board of directors without a super majority vote in addition a super majority vote is required to approve transactions with interested shareholders shareholders do not have the right to call a shareholders meeting we have adopted a shareholders’ rights plan which under certain circumstances would significantly impair the ability of third parties to acquire control of us without prior approval of our board of directors this shareholders’ rights plan and the provisions in our charter documents could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us even if doing so would benefit our shareholders 

unlike many jurisdictions in the united states cayman islands law does not currently provide for mergers as that expression is understood under corporate law in the united states while cayman islands law does have statutory provisions that provide for the reconstruction and amalgamation of companies which are commonly referred to in the cayman islands as a “scheme of arrangement” the procedural and legal requirements necessary to consummate these transactions are more rigorous and take longer to complete than the procedures typically required to consummate a merger in the united states under cayman islands law and practice a scheme of arrangement in relation to a solvent cayman islands exempted company must be approved at a shareholders’ meeting by a majority of the company’s shareholders who are present and voting either in person or by proxy at such meeting the shares voted in favor of the scheme of arrangement must also represent at least 75 of the value of each class of the company’s shareholders excluding the shares owned by the parties to the scheme of arrangement present and voting at the meeting the grand court of the cayman islands must also sanction the convening of these meetings and the terms of the amalgamation although there is no requirement to seek the consent of the creditors of the parties involved in the scheme of arrangement the grand court typically seeks to ensure that the creditors have consented to the transfer of their liabilities to the surviving entity or that the scheme of arrangement does not otherwise materially adversely affect the creditors’ interests furthermore the grand court will only approve a scheme of arrangement if it is satisfied that

overview 

 

we are a leading worldwide provider of navigation communications and information devices most of which are enabled by global positioning system or gps technology we operate in four business segments which serve the marine outdoorfitness automotivemobile and aviation markets our segments offer products through our network of independent dealers and distributors however the nature of products and types of customers for the four segments can vary significantly as such the segments are managed separately our portable gps receivers and accessories for marine recreationfitness and automotivemobile segments are sold primarily to retail outlets our aviation products are portable and panelmount avionics for visual flight rules and instrument flight rules navigation and are sold primarily to retail outlets and certain aircraft manufacturers 

since our first products were delivered in 1991 we have generated positive income from operations each year and have funded our growth from these profits our sales have increased at a compounded annual growth rate of 40 since 2002 and our net income has increased at a compounded annual growth rate of 38 since 2002 the vast majority of this growth has been organic only a very small amount of new revenue occurred as a result of the acquisition of ups aviation technologies in 2003 motionbased technologies in 2005 and dynastream innovations inc in 2006 these acquisitions had no significant impact on net income for those years 

since our principal locations are in the united states taiwan and the uk we experience some foreign currency fluctuations in our operating results the functional currency of our european operations is the us dollar effective in 2001 and the functional currency of our asian operations is the new taiwan dollar less than 15 percent of transactions of our european operations are now denominated in british pounds sterling or the euro we experienced 06 million 153 million 248 million 67 million and 00 million in foreign currency gains losses during fiscal years 2006 2005 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively to date we have not entered into hedging transactions with the euro the british pound sterling or the new taiwan dollar although we may utilize hedging transactions in the future 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

 

general 

 

garmin’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon garmin’s consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the presentation of these financial statements requires garmin to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis garmin evaluates its estimates including those related to customer sales programs and incentives product returns bad debts inventories investments intangible assets income taxes warranty obligations and contingencies and litigation garmin bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgements about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

revenue recognition 

 

garmin records estimated reductions to revenue for customer sales programs returns and incentive offerings including rebates price protection promotions and other volumebased incentives the reductions to revenue are based on estimates and judgements using historical experience and expectation of future conditions changes in these estimates could negatively affect garmin’s operating results these incentives are accrued for on a percentage of sales basis and reviewed periodically if market conditions were to decline garmin may take actions to increase customer incentive offerings possibly resulting in an incremental reduction of revenue at the time the incentive is offered 

 

warranties 

 

garmin’s products sold are generally covered by a warranty for periods ranging from one to two years garmin accrues a warranty reserve for estimated costs to provide warranty services garmin’s estimate of costs to service its warranty obligations is based on historical experience and expectation of future conditions to the extent garmin experiences increased warranty claim activity or increased costs associated with servicing those claims its warranty accrual will increase resulting in decreased gross profit 

inventory 

 

garmin writes down its inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management additional inventory writedowns may be required 

investments 

investments are classified as available for sale and recorded at fair value and unrealized investment gains and losses are reflected in stockholders’ equity investment income is recorded when earned and capital gains and losses are recognized when investments are sold investments are reviewed periodically to determine if they have suffered an impairment of value that is considered other than temporary if investments are determined to be impaired a capital loss is recognized at the date of determination 

testing for impairment of investments also requires significant management judgement the identification of potentially impaired investments the determination of their fair value and the assessment of whether any decline in value is other than temporary are the key judgement elements the discovery of new information and the passage of time can significantly change these judgements revisions of impairment judgements are made when new information becomes known and any resulting impairment adjustments are made at that time the economic environment and volatility of securities markets increase the difficulty of determining fair value and assessing investment impairment 

 

income taxes 

 

garmin provides deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the difference between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their carrying amount for financial reporting purposes as measured by the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse while no valuation allowance has been recorded it is garmin’s policy to record a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to an amount that it believes is more likely than not to be realized while garmin has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance in the event garmin were to determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax assets in the future an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such determination was made likewise should garmin determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase income in the period such determination was made 

in addition the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations we recognize liabilities for tax audit issues in the us and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes will be due if payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary if our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment a further charge to expense would result 

stock based compensation 

garmin distributes stock options or stock appreciation rights “sars” each year as part of garmin’s compensation package for employees employees with certain levels of responsibility within garmin are eligible for stock option or sar grants but the granting of options or sars is at the discretion of the compensation committee of the board of directors and is not a contractual obligation stock compensation plans are discussed in detail in note 10 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

accounting terms and characteristics 

net sales 

our net sales are primarily generated through sales to our global dealer and distributor network and to original equipment manufacturers we recognize sales when title of the products passes to the customer generally at the time products are shipped our sales are largely of a consumer nature therefore backlog levels are not necessarily indicative of our future sales results we aim to achieve a quick turnaround on orders we receive and we typically ship most orders within 72 hours 

net sales are subject to some seasonal fluctuation typically sales of our consumer products are highest in the second quarter due to increased demand during the spring and summer marine season and in the fourth quarter due to increased demand during the holiday buying season our aviation products do not experience much seasonal variation but are more influenced by the timing of the release of new products when the initial demand is typically the strongest 

 

 

gross profit 

 

raw material costs are our most significant component of cost of goods sold in the first half of 2006 we experienced meaningful price declines on flash memory and color screens which allowed us to hold margins in our automobile segment steady in the face of price declines and allowed us to improve margins in other business segments as well while these price declines did not continue throughout all of 2006 we did have additional component cost reductions as we neared year end in 2005 we experienced a shift in product mix to lowermargin product groups which continued in 2006 and price declines related to increased competition both in relation to the rapidly growing automotive navigation product line we experienced shortages in certain high technology components in early 2004 as well as upward pricing pressure on components in the first half of 2004 much of which was alleviated by the end of the fiscal year 

our existing practice of performing the design and manufacture of our products inhouse has enabled us to utilize alternative lower cost components from different suppliers and where possible to redesign our products to permit us to use these lower cost components we believe that because of our practice of performing the design manufacture and marketing of our products inhouse our shijr taiwan jhongli taiwan olathe kansas and salem oregon manufacturing plants have experienced relatively low costs of manufacturing in general products manufactured in taiwan have been our highest volume products our manufacturing labor costs historically have been lower in taiwan than in olathe and salem 

sales price variability has had and can be expected to have an effect on our gross profit in the past prices of our devices sold into the automotivemobile market have declined due to market pressures and introduction of new products sold at lower price points the average selling prices of our aviation products have increased due to product mix and the introduction of more advanced products sold at higher prices the effect of the sales price variability inherent within the mix of gpsenabled products sold could have a significant impact on our gross profit 

selling general and administrative expenses 

our selling general and administrative expenses consist primarily of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with the expected increase of total revenues in the future we expect selling general and administrative expenses to continue to increase for the foreseeable future we intend to increase advertising and marketing expenses in order to focus on individual markets and build increased brand awareness in the consumer marketplace especially as we continue to develop new markets and expand opportunities in rapidly growing markets like portable automobile navigation which is becoming a mass market we also intend to increase our customer call center support as our business continues to grow we also anticipate increased selling general and administrative costs associated with information technology staffing and support activities 

research and development 

the majority of our research and development costs represent salaries for our engineers costs for high technology components used in product and prototype development and costs of test equipment needed during product development approximately 82 of the research and development of our products is performed in the united states the remainder of our research and development activities are performed by our taiwan engineering group which has increased in size in recent years 

we are committed to increasing the level of innovative design and development of new products as we strive for expanded ability to serve our existing consumer and aviation markets as well as new markets for gpsenabled devices we continue to grow our research and development budget in absolute terms 

customers 

 

no customer accounted for 10 or more of our sales in the year ended december 30 2006 our top ten customers have contributed between 25 and 37 of net sales since 2001 we have experienced average sales days in our customer accounts receivable of between 35 and 62 days since 2001 the average sales days in our customer accounts receivable was 62 days as of december 30 2006 we have experienced an increase in the level of customer accounts receivable days due to changes in product mix and longer payment terms and anticipate maintaining approximately the current level of accounts receivable days going forward 

 

income taxes 

 

we have experienced a relatively low effective corporate tax rate due to the proportion of our revenue generated by entities in tax jurisdictions with low statutory rates in particular lower marginal tax rates and substantial tax incentives offered by the taiwanese government on certain hightechnology capital investments and other taiwan tax credits due to repatriation of 2006 earnings have continued to reduce our tax rate there therefore profits earned in taiwan have been taxed at a lower rate than those in the united states and europe as a result our consolidated effective tax rate was approximately 135 percent during 2006 we have taken advantage of the tax benefit in taiwan since our inception and we expect to continue to benefit from lower effective tax rates at least through 2011 the current taiwan tax incentives for which garmin has received approval will end in 2011 we plan on applying for additional incentives for years beyond 2011 based on capital investments we expect to make in the future however there can be no assurance that such tax incentives will be available indefinitely or that we will receive the incentives for which we apply management also believes that the revenue shift to our lowertax rate corporate entities will continue however certain tax credits will not be available in 2007 so the effective tax rate for fiscal 2007 is expected to be slightly higher than fiscal 2006 the actual effective tax rate will be dependent upon the production volume additional capital investments made during fiscal 2007 and the composition of our earnings 

results of operations 

the following table sets forth our results of operations as a percentage of net sales during the periods shown 

 

 

the following table sets forth our results of operations through income before income taxes for each of our four segments during the period shown for each line item in the table the total of the segments’ amounts equals the amount in the consolidated statements of income data included in item 6 

 

 

 

 

 

comparison of fiscal years ended december 30 2006 and december 31 2005 

 

 

net sales 

 

the increase in total net sales during fiscal 2006 was primarily due to the introduction of over 70 new products and overall demand for our automotive and outdoorfitness products total units sold increased 78 to 5400000 in 2006 from 3028000 in 2005 in general management believes that continuous innovation and the introduction of new products are essential for future revenue growth 

garmin’s revenues are normally seasonal with the fiscal second and fourth quarter revenues being meaningfully higher than the first and third fiscal quarters in 2006 revenues followed this typical seasonal pattern with increases each quarter over the prior year’s quarter due to the impact of new product releases across all product lines the revenue increase in the second quarter was primarily attributable to sellin of popular new portable automobile navigation and outdoorfitness products and father’s daygraduation purchases the revenue increase in the fourth quarter was primarily attributable to late summer new product releases and sales associated with the traditional holiday selling season revenues can also be impacted in any given quarter by the timing of new product introductions 

the increase in net sales to consumers was primarily due to the introduction of many new automotive outdoorfitness and marine products and overall demand for our automotive and outdoorfitness products it is management’s belief that the continued demand for the company’s automotive products is due to overall increased consumer awareness of the capabilities and applications of gps particularly as those capabilities pertain to automobile navigation additionally the expansion of the gps market in general as well as enhanced feature sets in our products specifically have added to our growth the increase in aviation sales for fiscal 2006 was primarily due to increased sales from panel mount products sold into the oem original equipment manufacturers and retrofit markets sales of the g1000 integrated glass cockpit were the primary reason for increased oem sales in 2006 while temporary flight restrictions tfrs continue to impact general aviation the flying community is adapting to these changes and returning to the skies in greater numbers should the federal aviation administration faa impose more restrictions or elect to shutdown us airspace in the future these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business 

gross profit 

 

the increase in gross profit dollars was primarily attributable to the introduction of over 70 new products and strong demand for our automotive and outdoorfitness products the reduction in gross margin percentage was primarily due to the strong growth experienced in our lowermargin automotivemobile product line offset to some extent by strong gross margins in our other three segments notably gross margin in our automotivemobile segment did not fall as much as anticipated due to better than anticipated raw material cost reductions volume discounts on certain components less price competition than anticipated and new “premium” featurerich products with higher selling prices and margins management believes that the trend to lower gross margin percentages will continue in the future as net sales of automotive products increase at a faster rate than the other business segments the decline in aviation gross margin was primarily due to a shift in product mix within our oem and retrofit products and the delay of some anticipated oem and retrofit products 

selling general and administrative expenses 

 

the increase in expense was primarily attributable to increases in employment generally across the organization significantly increased advertising costs up 93 associated primarily with massmarket advertising to increase brand awareness and promote our automotive products increased information technology staffing and support costs increased staffing in our sales and marketing group to increase focus on specific target markets and additional staffing in our customer call center management expects that because of strong demand for our products selling general and administrative expenses will rise in absolute dollars but decline as a percentage of sales during fiscal 2007 as increased advertising and marketing activities build awareness of the garmin brand and demand for garmin products worldwide

the increase in research and development expense was primarily attributable to the addition of over 250 associates to our research and development team during fiscal 2006 management believes that one of the key strategic initiatives for future growth and success of garmin is continuous innovation development and introduction of new products management expects that its research and development expenses will increase approximately 25  30 during fiscal 2007 on an absolute dollar basis due to the anticipated introduction of a strong portfolio of new products slated for fiscal 2007 management expects to continue to invest in the research and development of new products and technology in order to maintain garmin’s competitive advantage in the markets in which it competes 

other income expense 

 

other income expense principally consists of interest income interest expense and foreign currency exchange gains and losses other income expense was higher in fiscal 2006 relative to fiscal 2005 with the majority of this difference caused by increased interest income in 2006 interest income for fiscal 2006 increased due to higher interest rates and larger cash and marketable securities balances during the year increasing the returns on the company’s cash and cash equivalents 

during fiscal 2006 the company experienced foreign currency exchange gains of 06 million although the us dollar weakened slightly versus the taiwan dollar and british pound 3260 tdusd and 051 gbpusd relative to the end of fiscal 2005 3284 tdusd and 058 gbpusd during fiscal 2005 the company experienced foreign currency exchange gains of 153 million as the us dollar strengthened versus the taiwan dollar and british pound 3284 tdusd and 058 gbpusd relative to the end of fiscal 2004 3219 tdusd and 052 gbpusd 

income tax provision 

income tax expense increased by 190 million to 804 for fiscal year 2006 from 614 million for fiscal year 2005 due to our higher taxable income the effective tax rate was 135 for fiscal 2006 versus 165 for fiscal 2005 the decrease in tax rate is due to additional tax benefits received from taiwan as a result of our continued capital investment in our manufacturing facilities in taiwan tax credits resulting from our decision to repatriate certain of our taiwan earnings to our parent company and the increased contribution to our income from lower tax jurisdictions during 2006 relative to 2005 this lower effective tax rate resulted in a decrease in the ratio of income tax as a percentage of revenue of approximately 14 from fiscal 2005 to fiscal 2006 

net income 

as a result of the various factors noted above net income increased 65 to 5141 million for fiscal year 2006 compared to 3112 million for fiscal year 2005 

comparison of fiscal years ended december 31 2005 and december 25 2004 

net sales 

 

the increase in total net sales during fiscal 2005 was primarily due to the introduction of over 50 new products and overall demand for our automotive and aviation products total units sold increased 31 to 3028000 in 2005 from 2306000 in 2004 in general management believes that continuous innovation and the introduction of new products are essential for future revenue growth 

the company’s revenues are normally seasonal with the fiscal second and fourth quarter revenues meaningfully higher than the first and third fiscal quarters in 2005 revenues followed this typical seasonal pattern with increases each quarter over the prior year’s quarter due to the impact of new product releases across all product lines 

the revenue increase in second quarter was primarily attributable to initial sellin of popular new portable automobile navigation products the onset of the marine selling season and father’s day purchases the revenue increase in the fourth quarter was primarily attributable to sales momentum in our automotive products segment new product releases and sales associated with the traditional holiday selling season the increase in aviation sales for fiscal 2005 was primarily due to increased sales from panel mount products sold into the oem original equipment manufacturers and retrofit markets sales of the g1000 integrated glass cockpit was the primary reason for increased oem sales in 2005 while temporary flight restrictions tfrs continue to impact general aviation the flying community is adapting to these changes and returning to the skies in greater numbers should the federal aviation administration faa impose more restrictions or elect to shutdown us airspace in the future these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business 

revenues can also be impacted in any given quarter by the timing of new product introductions it is management’s belief that the continued demand for garmin’s products is due to the expansion of the gps market in general and overall increased consumer awareness of the capabilities and applications of gps particularly as those capabilities pertain to automobile navigation 

gross profit 

 

the increase in gross profit dollars was primarily attributable to the introduction of over 50 new products and overall demand for our marine outdoorfitness automotivemobile and aviation products the reduction in gross margin percentage was primarily due to reduced prices on older marine and outdoorfitness products in advance of new product releases and a shift in product mix towards the fastergrowing lowermargin automotivemobile product line the increase in aviation gross margin was primarily due to a shift in product mix within our oem and retrofit products as the g1000 product line began a second year of selling into new aircraft and program costs were no longer a significant cost in this business segment 

selling general and administrative expenses 

 

the increase in expense was primarily attributable to increases in employment generally across the organization net increase of over 400 nonengineering employees significantly increased advertising costs up 101 associated primarily with increasing garmin brand awareness and promotion of automotive products increased information technology staffing and support costs increased staffing in our sales and marketing group to increase focus on specific target markets and additional staffing in our customer call center 

research and development expenses 

 

the increase in research and development expense was primarily attributable to the addition of 142 associates to our research and development team during fiscal 2005 management believes that one of the key strategic initiatives for future growth and success of the company is continuous innovation development and introduction of new products and this requires strong support of our research and development activities 

other income expense 

 

other income expense principally consists of interest income interest expense and foreign currency exchange gains and losses other income expense was significantly higher in fiscal 2005 relative to fiscal 2004 with the majority of this difference caused by increased interest income and foreign currency gains in 2005 interest income for fiscal 2005 increased due to higher interest rates and larger cash and marketable securities balances during the year increasing the returns on the company’s cash and cash equivalents

income tax provision 

income tax expense increased by 119 million to 614 million for fiscal year 2005 from 495 million for fiscal year 2004 due to our higher taxable income the effective tax rate was 165 for fiscal 2005 versus 194 for fiscal 2004 the decrease in tax rate was due to additional tax benefits received from taiwan as a result of our continued capital investment in our manufacturing facilities in taiwan tax credits resulting from our decision to repatriate certain of our taiwan earnings to our parent company and the increased contribution to our income from lower tax jurisdictions during 2005 relative to 2004 this lower effective tax rate resulted in a decrease in the ratio of income tax as a percentage of revenue of approximately 05 from fiscal 2004 to fiscal 2005 

net income 

as a result of the various factors noted above net income increased 51 to 3112 million for fiscal year 2005 compared to 2057 million for fiscal year 2004 

liquidity and capital resources 

net cash generated by operations was 3619 million 2470 million and 2089 million for fiscal years 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively we operate with a customeroriented approach and seek to maintain sufficient inventory to meet customer demand because we desire to respond quickly to our customers and minimize order fulfillment time our inventory levels are generally substantial enough to meet most demand we also attempt to carry sufficient inventory levels of key components so that potential supplier shortages have as minimal an impact as possible on our ability to deliver our finished products we significantly increased our raw material and finished goods inventories in the third quarter of 2006 in anticipation of a strong demand for our products during the holiday season and returned them to more normal levels by the end of the fourth quarter we prefer to have sufficient finished goods on hand to meet anticipated demand for our products raw materials and finished goods inventory levels continued to grow year over year as a function of our growing sales we anticipate days of inventory to stabilize at current levels in 2007 although absolute dollars of inventory will continue to rise reflecting the growth of our business 

capital expenditures in 2006 totaled 929 million an increase of 658 million from fiscal 2005 this amount in 2006 reflects the purchase and renovation of an additional manufacturing facility in jhongli taiwan the purchase of a new european headquarters as well as ordinary capital expenditures for fiscal 2006 capital expenditures in 2005 totaled 271 million a decrease of 510 million from fiscal 2004 capital expenditures during 2004 included the olathe kansas facility expansion the amount in 2005 reflects normal capital expenditure levels 

we have budgeted approximately 65 million of capital expenditures during fiscal 2007 to include normal ongoing capital expenditures as well as purchases of production machinery and equipment to expand capacity in the jhongli taiwan facility 

in addition to capital expenditures in 2006 cash flow used in investing related to the purchase of dynastream innovations inc for 365 million fixed income securities associated with the investment of our onhand cash balances and approximately 31 million of intangible assets garmin’s average return on its investments during fiscal 2006 was approximately 47 in addition to capital expenditures in 2005 cash flow used in investing related to the purchase of fixed income securities associated with the investment of our onhand cash balances and approximately 36 million of intangible assets garmin’s average return on its investments during fiscal 2005 was approximately 31 in addition to capital expenditures in 2004 cash flow used in investing related to the purchase of fixed income securities associated with the investment of our onhand cash balances and approximately 18 million of intangible assets garmin’s average return on its investments during fiscal year 2004 was approximately 17 it is management’s goal to invest the onhand cash consistent with garmin’s investment policy which has been approved by the board of directors the investment policy’s primary purpose is to preserve capital maintain an acceptable degree of liquidity and maximize yield within the constraint of low credit risk 

 

 

cash flow related to financing activities resulted in a net use of cash in 2006 of 1327 million during 2006 garmin repurchased 1155300 shares of its common shares under the 3000000share stock repurchase program that was approved by the board of directors on august 3 2006 and expires on december 31 2007 sources and uses in financing activities during 2006 related primarily to uses for the payment of a dividend 1079 million and stock repurchase 505 million and a source of cash from the issuance of common stock related to the exercise of employee stock options the related tax benefit and the employee stock purchase plan 257 million cash flow related to financing activities resulted in a net use of cash in 2005 of 709 million during 2005 garmin repurchased 638000 shares of its common shares under the 3000000share stock repurchase program that was approved by the board of directors on april 21 2004 and expired on april 30 2006 sources and uses in financing activities during 2005 related primarily to uses for the payment of a dividend 540 million and stock repurchase 267 million and a source of cash from the issuance of common shares related to the exercise of employee stock options the related tax benefit and the employee stock purchase plan 97 million cash flow related to financing activities resulted in a net use of cash in 2004 of 511 million during 2004 garmin repurchased 100000 shares of its common shares under the 3000000share stock repurchase program sources and uses in financing activities during 2004 related primarily to uses for the payment of a dividend 541 million and stock repurchase 31 million and a source of cash from the issuance of common stock related to the exercise of employee stock options the related tax benefit and the employee stock purchase plan 61 million 

cash dividends paid to shareholders were 1079 million 540 million and 541 million during fiscal years 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively 

we believe that our existing cash balances and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our projected capital expenditures working capital and other cash requirements at least through the end of fiscal 2009 

contractual obligations and commercial commitments 

future payments due from garmin as of december 30 2006 aggregated by type of contractual obligation are

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we do not have any offbalance sheet arrangements 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market sensitivity 

 

we have market risk primarily in connection with the pricing of our products and services and the purchase of raw materials product pricing and raw materials costs are both significantly influenced by semiconductor market conditions historically during cyclical industry downturns we have been able to offset pricing declines for our products through a combination of improved product mix and success in obtaining price reductions in raw materials costs 

inflation 

we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our business financial condition or results of operations if our costs were to become subject to significant inflationary pressures we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs through price increases our inability or failure to do so could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

the operation of garmin’s subsidiaries in international markets results in exposure to movements in currency exchange rates we generally have not been significantly affected by foreign exchange fluctuations because the taiwan dollar and british pound have proven to be relatively stable however periodically we have experienced significant foreign currency gains and losses due to the strengthening and weakening of the us dollar the potential of volatile foreign exchange rate fluctuations in the future could have a significant effect on our results of operations 

the currencies that create a majority of the company’s exchange rate exposure are the taiwan dollar and british pound garmin corporation located in shijr taiwan uses the local currency as the functional currency the company translates all assets and liabilities at yearend exchange rates and income and expense accounts at average rates during the year in order to minimize the effect of the currency exchange fluctuations on our net assets we have elected to retain most of our taiwan subsidiary’s cash and investments in marketable securities denominated in us dollars the tdusd exchange rate decreased 07 during 2006 which resulted in a cumulative translation adjustment of negative 12 million at the end of fiscal 2006 and a net foreign currency loss of 31 million at garmin corporation during 2006 

garmin europe located in romsey great britain uses the us dollar as the functional currency however as some transactions occur in british pounds foreign currency gains or losses have been realized historically and have become more significant in recent years as garmin europe has grown the gbpusd exchange rate decreased 123 during 2006 and resulted in a net foreign currency gain of 37 million at garmin europe 

if the tdusd exchange rate had decreased 10 and the gbpusd exchange rate had increased 10 in 2006 the cumulative translation adjustment would have been a negative 14 million at the end of fiscal 2006 and the foreign currency loss would have been 447 million as the majority of our worldwide sales are transacted in us dollars the impact on sales related to foreign currency movements is minimal 

interest rate risk 

we have 02 million of outstanding longterm debt which is associated with the acquisition of dynastream innovations inc which will be eliminated in fiscal 2007 given this debt amount is financially immaterial to garmin there is no meaningful debtrelated interest rate risk 

we are exposed to interest rate risk in connection with our investments in marketable securities as interest rates change the unrealized gains and losses associated with those securities will fluctuate accordingly a hypothetical change of 10 in interest rates would not have a material effect on such unrealized gains or losses at december 30 2006 cumulative unrealized losses on those securities were 47 million

company overview 

garmin is a leading worldwide provider of navigation communications and information devices most of which are enabled by gps technology garmin designs develops manufactures and markets a diverse family of handheld portable and fixedmount gpsenabled products and other navigation communications and information products for the consumer and general aviation markets 

overview of the global positioning system 

the global positioning system is a worldwide navigation system which enables the precise determination of geographic location using established satellite technology the system consists of a constellation of orbiting satellites the satellites and their ground control and monitoring stations are maintained and operated by the united states department of defense which maintains an ongoing satellite replenishment program to ensure continuous global system coverage access to the system is provided free of charge by the us government 

 

reception of gps signals from the satellites requires lineofsight visibility between the satellites and the receiver gps receivers can be very compact and it is not necessary to have a large dish antenna to receive gps signals 

prior to may 2000 the us department of defense intentionally degraded the accuracy of civilian gps signals in a process known as selective availability ‘‘sa’’ for national security purposes sa variably degraded gps position accuracy to a radius of 100 meters on may 2 2000 the us department of defense discontinued sa in a presidential policy statement issued in december 2004 the bush administration stated that the us does not intend to implement sa again and is committed to preventing hostile use of gps through regional denial of service minimizing the impact to peaceful users with sa removed a gps receiver can calculate its position to an accuracy of approximately 10 meters or less enhancing the utility of gps for most applications 

the accuracy and utility of gps can be enhanced through augmentation techniques which compute any remaining errors in the signal and broadcast these corrections to a gps device the federal aviation administration “faa” has developed a wide area augmentation system ‘‘waas’’ comprising ground reference stations and additional satellites that improve the accuracy of gps positioning available in the united states and portions of canada and mexico to approximately 3 meters waas supports the use of gps as the primary means of enroute terminal and approach navigation for aviation in the united states the increased accuracy offered by waas also enhances the utility of waasenabled gps receivers for consumer applications the faa announced on july 11 2003 that the waas system had achieved initial operating capability and that the system was available for instrument flight use with appropriately certified avionics equipment since that time the faa has installed additional ground reference stations and has launched additional waas satellites

competition 

the market for navigation communications and information products is highly competitive garmin believes the principal competitive factors impacting the market for its products are design functionality quality and reliability customer service brand price timetomarket and availability garmin believes that it generally competes favorably in each of these areas 

garmin believes that its principal competitors for portable automotive products are tomtom nv thales navigation inc “thales” alpine electronics inc lowrance electronics inc ‘‘lowrance’’ cobra electronics corporation “cobra” navman nz ltd a subsidiary of brunswick corporation “navman” mitac international corp “mitac” navigon ag “navigon” and sony corporation garmin believes that its principal competitors for handheld recreational product lines are thales and lowrance for marine chartplotter products garmin believes that its principal competitors are raymarine ltd “raymarine” furuno electronic company “furuno” navman the standard vertex division of yaesu co ltd “standard” simrad and the northstar technologies unit of brunswick corporation for garmin’s fishfinderdepth sounder product lines garmin believes that its principal competitors are lowrance raymarine the humminbird division of johnson outdoors inc navman simrad and furuno for garmin’s general aviation product lines garmin considers its principal competitors to be lowrance for portable gps units and honeywell inc avidyne corporation l3 avionics systems meggitt plc rockwell collins inc universal avionics systems corporation chelton flight systems and free flight systems for panelmount gps and display units for garmin’s family radio service and general mobile radio service product line garmin believes that its principal competitors are motorola inc “motorola” cobra and audiovox corporation for garmin’s personal digital assistant product line garmin considers its principal competitors to be palm inc mitac navman medion ag navigon hewlettpackard company acer corporation dell computer corporation and toshiba corporation 

research and development 

garmin’s product innovations are driven by its strong emphasis on research and development and the close partnership between garmin’s engineering and manufacturing teams garmin’s products are created by its engineering and development staff which numbered 709 people worldwide as of december 31 2005 garmin’s manufacturing staff includes manufacturing process engineers who work closely with garmin’s design engineers to ensure manufacturability and manufacturing cost control for its products garmin’s development staff includes industrial designers as well as software engineers electrical engineers mechanical engineers and cartography garmin believes the industrial design of its products has played an important role in garmin’s success once a development project is initiated and approved a multidisciplinary team is created to design the product and transition it into manufacturing 

 

below is a table of garmin’s expenditures on research and development over the last three fiscal years 

 

 

 

manufacturing and operations 

garmin believes that one of its core competencies is its manufacturing capability at its shijr taiwan facility its olathe kansas facility and its salem oregon facility garmin believes that its vertically integrated approach has provided it the following benefits 

reduced timetomarket utilizing concurrent engineering techniques garmin’s products are introduced to production at an early development stage and the feedback provided by manufacturing is incorporated into the design before mass production begins in this manner garmin attempts to reduce the time required to move a product from its design phase to mass production deliveries with improved quality and yields reducing time to market has enabled garmin to offer several industry firsts such as the rino gpsenabled family radio servicegeneral mobile radio service twoway radio the ique 3600 portable digital assistant with integrated gps and mapping and the gns 430 which integrates traditional aviation navigation and communications systems with gps in a single package 

design and process optimization garmin uses its manufacturing resources to rapidly prototype design concepts products and processes in order to achieve higher efficiency lower cost and better value for customers garmin’s ability to fully explore product design and manufacturing process concepts has enabled it to optimize its designs to minimize size and weight in gps devices that are functional waterproof and rugged 

logistical agility operating its own manufacturing facilities helps garmin minimize problems such as component shortages and long component lead times which are common in the electronics industry many products can be reengineered to bypass component shortages or reduce cost and the new designs can quickly fill the distribution pipeline garmin reacts rapidly to changes in market demand by maintaining a safety stock of longlead components and by rescheduling components from one product line to another 

garmin’s design and manufacturing processes are certified to iso 90012000 international quality standards developed by the international organization for standardization garmin’s taiwan manufacturing facility has also achieved ts 169492002 quality certification a quality standard for automotive suppliers in addition garmin’s aviation panelmount products are designed and manufactured according to processes which are approved and monitored by the faa 

materials 

garmin purchases components for its products from a number of suppliers around the world for certain components garmin relies on sole source suppliers the failure of our suppliers to deliver components in sufficient quantities and in a timely manner could adversely affect our business 

 

seasonality 

our sales are subject to some seasonal fluctuation typically sales of our consumer products are highest in the second quarter due to increased demand during the spring and summer marine season and in the fourth quarter due to increased demand during the holiday buying season sales of consumer products are also influenced by the timing of the release of new products our aviation products do not experience much seasonal variation but are more influenced by the timing of the release of new products when the initial demand is typically the strongest 

backlog 

our sales are generally of a consumer nature and there is a relatively short cycle between order and shipment therefore we believe that backlog information is not material to the understanding of our business we typically ship most orders within 72 hours of receipt 

intellectual property 

our success and ability to compete is dependent in part on our proprietary technology we rely on a combination of patent copyright trademark and trade secret laws as well as confidentiality agreements to establish and protect our proprietary rights as of march 1 2006 we held 254 us patents that expire at various dates no earlier than 2009 as of march 1 2006 garmin had 160 us patent applications pending garmin also holds 4 foreign patents and has 11 foreign patent applications pending in addition garmin often relies on licenses of intellectual property for use in its business for example garmin obtains licenses for digital cartography technology for use in our products from various sources our registered us trademarks include garmin bluechart city select dcg etrex etrex camo etrex legend etrex summit etrex venture etrex vista forerunner gnc gpsmap ique mapsource metroguide personal navigator quest rino seethru streetpilot and tracback our mark garmin and certain of our other trademarks have also been registered in selected foreign countries garmin’s trademarks include edge foretrex garmin mobile g1000 geko motionbased nroute nÜvi personal travel assistant que and ultrascroll some of garmin’s patents and its registered trademarks and trademarks are owned by garmin’s subsidiaries garmin corporation garmin international inc and garmin at inc 

we believe that our continued success depends on the intellectual skills of our employees and their ability to continue to innovate garmin will continue to file and prosecute patent applications when appropriate to attempt to protect garmin’s rights in its proprietary technologies 

there is no assurance that garmin’s current patents or patents which we may later acquire may successfully withstand any challenge in whole or in part it is also possible that any patent issued to garmin may not provide us with any competitive advantages or that the patents of others will preclude garmin from manufacturing and marketing certain products despite garmin’s efforts to protect its proprietary rights unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of garmin’s products or to obtain and use information that garmin regards as proprietary litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce garmin’s intellectual property rights to protect its trade secrets to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others or to defend against claims of infringement or invalidity 

 

regulations 

garmin’s aviation products that are intended for installation in “type certificated aircraft” are required to be certified by the faa its european counterpart the european aviation safety agency and other comparable organizations before they can be used in an aircraft the telecommunications industry is highly regulated and the regulatory environment in which garmin operates is subject to change in accordance with federal communication commission “fcc” rules and regulations wireless transceiver and cellular handset products are required to be certified by the fcc and comparable authorities in foreign countries where they are sold garmin’s products sold in europe are required to comply with relevant directives of the european commission a delay in receiving required certifications for new products or enhancements to garmin’s products or losing certification for garmin’s existing products could adversely affect our business 

because garmin corporation one of the company’s principal subsidiaries is located in taiwan foreign exchange control laws and regulations of taiwan with respect to remittances into and out of taiwan may have an impact on garmin’s operations the taiwan foreign exchange control statute and regulations thereunder provide that all foreign exchange transactions must be executed by banks designated to handle such business by the ministry of finance of taiwan and by the central bank of china also referred to as the cbc current regulations favor traderelated foreign exchange transactions consequently foreign currency earned from exports of merchandise and services may now be retained and used freely by exporters while all foreign currency needed for the import of merchandise and services may be purchased freely from the designated foreign exchange banks aside from traderelated foreign exchange transactions taiwan companies and residents may without foreign exchange approval remit outside and into taiwan foreign currencies of up to 50 million and 5 million respectively or their equivalent each calendar year currency conversions within the limits are processed by the designated banks and do not have to be reviewed and approved by the cbc the above limits apply to remittances involving a conversion between new taiwan dollars and us dollars or other foreign currencies the cbc typically approves foreign exchange in excess of the limits if a party applies with the cbc for review and presents legitimate business reasons justifying the currency conversion a requirement is also imposed on all enterprises to register all medium and longterm foreign debt with the cbc 

environmental matters 

 

the european union “eu” has enacted the restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment directive rohs directive and the waste electrical and electronic equipment directive “weee directive” the rohs directive requires eu member states to enact laws prohibiting the use of certain substances including lead mercury cadmium and chromium in certain electronic products put on the market after july 1 2006 the weee directive requires eu member states to enact laws that come into effect by august 13 2005 regulating the collection recovery and recycling of waste from certain electronic products we have established a program in order to comply with such laws and regulations as they are enacted by the eu member states we are modifying the design of our products andor modifying our manufacturing processes andor using different components in our products in order to comply with such laws and regulations 

in addition the state of california has enacted legislation similar to the rohs directive that comes into effect on january 1 2007 and other states and countries including the people’s republic of china have proposed legislation similar to the rohs directive and the weee directive the cost of compliance with such legislation cannot yet be determined but may be substantial 

employees 

as of december 31 2005 garmin had 3034 fulltime employees worldwide of whom 1322 were in the united states 1628 were in taiwan and 84 were in the united kingdom none of garmin’s employees are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement garmin considers its employee relations to be good 




 item 1a risk factors 

the risks described below are not the only ones facing our company additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also impair our business operations if any of the following risks occur our business financial condition or operating results could be materially adversely affected 

risks related to the company 

our global positioning system products depend upon satellites maintained by the united states department of defense if a significant number of these satellites become inoperable unavailable or are not replaced or if the policies of the united states government for the use of the global positioning system without charge are changed or if there is interference with global positioning system signals our business will suffer 

the global positioning system is a satellitebased navigation and positioning system consisting of a constellation of orbiting satellites the satellites and their ground control and monitoring stations are maintained and operated by the united states department of defense the department of defense does not currently charge users for access to the satellite signals these satellites and their ground support systems are complex electronic systems subject to electronic and mechanical failures and possible sabotage the satellites were originally designed to have lives of 75 years and are subject to damage by the hostile space environment in which they operate however of the current deployment of satellites in place some have been operating for more than 13 years 

if a significant number of satellites were to become inoperable unavailable or are not replaced it would impair the current utility of our global positioning system products and would have a material negative effect on our business in addition there can be no assurance that the us government will remain committed to the operation and maintenance of global positioning system satellites over a long period or that the policies of the us government that provide for the use of the global positioning system without charge and without accuracy degradation will remain unchanged because of the increasing commercial applications of the global positioning system other us government agencies may become involved in the administration or the regulation of the use of global positioning system signals however in a presidential policy statement issued in december 2004 the bush administration stated that the us is committed to supporting and improving the global positioning system and will continue providing it free from direct user fees 

some of our products also use signals from systems that augment gps such as the wide area augmentation system waas waas is operated by the federal aviation administration any curtailment of the operating capability of waas could result in decreased user capability for many of our aviation products thereby impacting our markets 

any of the foregoing factors could affect the willingness of buyers of our products to select global positioning systembased products instead of products based on competing technologies 

a shut down of us airspace or imposition of restrictions on general aviation would harm our business 

on september 11 2001 terrorists hijacked and crashed four passenger aircraft operated by commercial air carriers resulting in major loss of life and property following the terrorist attacks the federal aviation administration “faa” ordered all aircraft operating in the us to be grounded for several days in addition to this shut down of us airspace the general aviation industry was further impacted by the additional restrictions implemented by the faa on those flights that fly utilizing visual flight rules vfr the faa restricted vfr flight inside 30 enhanced class b a 2025 mile radius around the 30 largest metropolitan areas in the usa airspace areas the aircraft owners and pilots association aopa estimated that these restrictions affected approximately 41800 general aviation aircraft based at 282 airports inside the 30 enhanced class b airspace areas the aopa estimates that approximately 90 of all general aviation flights are conducted vfr and that only 15 of general aviation pilots are current to fly utilizing instrument flight rules ifr 

 

the shut down of us airspace following september 11 2001 caused reduced sales of our general aviation products and delays in the shipment of our products manufactured in our taiwan manufacturing facility to our distribution facility in olathe kansas thereby adversely affecting our ability to supply new and existing products to our dealers and distributors 

any future shut down of us airspace or imposition of restrictions on general aviation could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results 

any reallocation of radio frequency spectrum could cause interference with the reception of global positioning system signals this interference could harm our business 

our global positioning system technology is dependent on the use of the standard positioning service sps provided by the us government’s global positioning system satellites the global positioning system operates in radio frequency bands that are globally allocated for radio navigation satellite services the assignment of spectrum is controlled by an international organization known as the international telecommunications union ‘‘itu’’ the federal communications commission ‘‘fcc’’ is responsible for the assignment of spectrum for nongovernment use in the united states in accordance with itu regulations any itu or fcc reallocation of radio frequency spectrum including frequency band segmentation or sharing of spectrum could cause interference with the reception of global positioning system signals and may materially and adversely affect the utility and reliability of our products which would in turn have a material adverse effect on our operating results in addition emissions from mobile satellite service and other equipment operating in adjacent frequency bands or inband may materially and adversely affect the utility and reliability of our products which could result in a material adverse effect on our operating results the fcc continually receives proposals for new technologies and services such as ultrawideband technologies which may seek to operate in or across the radio frequency bands currently used by the gps sps adverse decisions by the fcc that result in harmful interference to the delivery of the gps sps may materially and adversely affect the utility and reliability of our products which could result in a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition 

if we are not successful in the continued development introduction or timely manufacture of new products demand for our products could decrease 

we expect that a significant portion of our future revenue will continue to be derived from sales of newly introduced products the market for our products is characterized by rapidly changing technology evolving industry standards and changes in customer needs if we fail to introduce new products or to modify or improve our existing products in response to changes in technology industry standards or customer needs our products could rapidly become less competitive or obsolete we must continue to make significant investments in research and development in order to continue to develop new products enhance existing products and achieve market acceptance for such products however there can be no assurance that development stage products will be successfully completed or if developed will achieve significant customer acceptance 

if we are unable to successfully develop and introduce competitive new products and enhance our existing products our future results of operations would be adversely affected our pursuit of necessary technology may require substantial time and expense we may need to license new technologies to respond to technological change these licenses may not be available to us on terms that we can accept or may materially change the gross profits that we are able to obtain on our products we may not succeed in adapting our products to new technologies as they emerge development and manufacturing schedules for technology products are difficult to predict and there can be no assurance that we will achieve timely initial customer shipments of new products the timely availability of these products in volume and their acceptance by customers are important to our future success we have previously experienced delays in shipping certain of our products and any future delays whether due to product development delays manufacturing delays lack of market acceptance delays in regulatory approval or otherwise could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

 

if we do not correctly anticipate demand for our products we may not be able to secure sufficient quantities or costeffective production of our products or we could have costly excess production or inventories 

historically we have experienced steady increases in demand for our products although we did experience a decline in demand for our aviation products in 2001 due to declining economic conditions and the shut down of us airspace as a result of the terrorist attacks that occurred on september 11 2001 we have generally been able to increase production to meet this increasing demand however the demand for our products depends on many factors and will be difficult to forecast we expect that it will become more difficult to forecast demand as we introduce and support multiple products and as competition in the market for our products intensifies significant unanticipated fluctuations in demand could cause the following problems in our operations  

 

 

we may become subject to significant product liability costs 

if our aviation products malfunction or contain errors or defects airplane collisions or crashes could occur resulting in property damage personal injury or death malfunctions or errors or defects in our marine navigational products could cause boats to run aground or cause other wreckage personal injury or death if any of these events occurs we could be subject to significant liability for personal injury and property damage and under certain circumstances could be subject to a judgment for punitive damages we maintain insurance against accidentrelated risks involving our products however there can be no assurance that such insurance would be sufficient to cover the cost of damages to others or that such insurance will continue to be available at commercially reasonable rates in addition insurance coverage generally will not cover awards of punitive damages if we are unable to maintain sufficient insurance to cover product liability costs or if our insurance coverage does not cover the award this could have a materially adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we depend on our suppliers some of which are the sole source for specific components and our production would be seriously harmed if these suppliers are not able to meet our demand and alternative sources are not available or if the costs of components rise 

we are dependent on third party suppliers for various components used in our current products some of the components that we procure from third party suppliers include semiconductors and electroluminescent panels liquid crystal displays memory chips and microprocessors the cost quality and availability of components are essential to the successful production and sale of our products some components we use are from sole source suppliers certain applicationspecific integrated circuits incorporating our proprietary designs are manufactured for us by sole source suppliers alternative sources may not be currently available for these sole source components 

in the past including in the first half of 2004 we have experienced shortages of liquid crystal displays and other components in addition if there are shortages in supply of components the costs of such components may rise if suppliers are unable to meet our demand for components on a timely basis and if we are unable to obtain an alternative source or if the price of the alternative source is prohibitive or if the costs of components rise our ability to maintain timely and costeffective production of our products would be seriously harmed 

we license mapping data for use in our products from various sources there are only a limited number of suppliers of mapping data for each geographical region if we are unable to continue licensing such mapping data and are unable to obtain an alternative source or if the price of the alternative source is prohibitive our ability to supply mapping data for use in our products would be seriously harmed 

 

we rely on independent dealers and distributors to sell our products and disruption to these channels would harm our business 

because we sell a majority of our products to independent dealers and distributors we are subject to many risks including risks related to their inventory levels and support for our products in particular our dealers and distributors maintain significant levels of our products in their inventories if dealers and distributors attempt to reduce their levels of inventory or if they do not maintain sufficient levels to meet customer demand our sales could be negatively impacted 

many of our dealers and distributors also sell products offered by our competitors if our competitors offer our dealers and distributors more favorable terms those dealers and distributors may deemphasize or decline to carry our products in the future we may not be able to retain or attract a sufficient number of qualified dealers and distributors if we are unable to maintain successful relationships with dealers and distributors or to expand our distribution channels our business will suffer 

failure to manage our growth and expansion effectively could adversely impact our business 

our ability to successfully offer our products and implement our business plan in a rapidly evolving market requires an effective planning and management process we continue to increase the scope of our operations domestically and internationally and have grown our shipments and headcount substantially this growth has placed and our anticipated growth in future operations will continue to place a significant strain on our management systems and resources 

our business may suffer if we are not able to hire and retain sufficient qualified personnel or if we lose our key personnel 

our future success depends partly on the continued contribution of our key executive engineering sales marketing manufacturing and administrative personnel we currently do not have employment agreements with any of our key executive officers we do not have key man life insurance on any of our key executive officers and do not currently intend to obtain such insurance the loss of the services of any of our senior level management or other key employees could harm our business recruiting and retaining the skilled personnel we require to maintain our market position may be difficult for example in some recent years there has been a nationwide shortage of qualified electrical engineers and software engineers who are necessary for us to design and develop new products and therefore it has sometimes been challenging to recruit such personnel if we fail to hire and retain qualified employees we may not be able to maintain and expand our business 

our sales and gross margins for our products may fluctuate or erode 

recently gross margins on our consumer products have been reduced because of higher than normal price reductions on older products and a shift in the product mix as automotive products continue to become a larger portion of revenue for our consumer product segment our sales and gross margins for our products may fluctuate from period to period due to a number of factors including product mix competition and unit volumes in particular the average selling prices of a specific product tend to decrease over that product’s life to offset such decreases we intend to rely primarily on obtaining yield improvements and corresponding cost reductions in the manufacture of existing products and on introducing new products that incorporate advanced features and therefore can be sold at higher average selling prices however there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain any such yield improvements or cost reductions or introduce any such new products in the future to the extent that such cost reductions and new product introductions do not occur in a timely manner or our products do not achieve market acceptance our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected as we introduce new product lines that serve personal digital assistant “pda” and original equipment manufacturer automotive and sensor board applications we may experience a decline in our overall gross margins from sales of these potentially high volume but low margin product lines 

 

our quarterly operating results are subject to fluctuations and seasonality 

our operating results are difficult to predict our future quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly if this occurs the price of our stock would likely decline as we expand our operations our operating expenses particularly our sales marketing and research and development costs may increase as a percentage of our sales if revenues decrease and we are unable to reduce those costs rapidly our operating results would be negatively affected 

historically our revenues have usually been weaker in the first and third quarters of each fiscal year and have from time to time been lower than the preceding quarter our devices are highly consumeroriented and consumer buying is traditionally lower in these quarters sales of certain of our consumer   products tend to be higher in our second fiscal quarter due to increased consumer spending for such products during the recreational marine and fishing season sales of certain of our consumer products also tend to be higher in our fourth fiscal quarter due to increased consumer spending patterns on electronic devices during the holiday season   in addition we attempt to time our new product releases to coincide with relatively higher consumer spending in the second and fourth fiscal quarters which contributes to these seasonal variations 

our quarterly financial statements will reflect fluctuations in foreign currency translation 

our taiwan subsidiary holds and is expected to continue to hold significant cash cash equivalents and marketable securities and receivables denominated in us dollars because the us dollar is the primary currency for our business and in order to substantially reduce the economic consequence of any variation in the exchange rate for the us dollar and the new taiwan dollar on these assets management expects that the taiwan subsidiary will continue to hold the majority of these assets in us dollar or us dollar denominated instruments nonetheless us gaap requires the company at the end of each accounting period to translate into new taiwan dollars all such us dollar denominated assets held by our taiwan subsidiary this translation is required because the new taiwan dollar is the functional currency of the subsidiary this us gaapmandated translation will cause us to recognize gain or loss on our financial statements as the new taiwan dollarus dollar exchange rate varies such gain or loss will create variations in our earnings per share because there is minimal cash impact caused by such exchange rate variations management will continue to focus on the company’s operating performance before the impact of the foreign currency translation 

if we are unable to compete effectively with existing or new competitors our resulting loss of competitive position could result in price reductions fewer customer orders reduced margins and loss of market share 

the markets for our products are highly competitive and we expect competition to increase in the future some of our competitors have significantly greater financial technical and marketing resources than we do these competitors may be able to respond more rapidly to new or emerging technologies or changes in customer requirements they may also be able to devote greater resources to the development promotion and sale of their products increased competition could result in price reductions fewer customer orders reduced margins and loss of market share our failure to compete successfully against current or future competitors could seriously harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

our intellectual property rights are important to our operations and we could suffer loss if they infringe upon other’s rights or are infringed upon by others 

we rely on a combination of patents copyrights trademarks and trade secrets confidentiality provisions and licensing arrangements to establish and protect our proprietary rights to this end we hold rights to a number of patents and registered trademarks and regularly file applications to attempt to protect our rights in new technology and trademarks however there is no guarantee that our patent applications will become issued patents or that our trademark applications will become registered trademarks moreover even if approved our patents or trademarks may thereafter be successfully challenged by others or otherwise become invalidated for a variety of reasons thus any patents or trademarks we currently have or may later acquire may not provide us a significant competitive advantage 

 

third parties may claim that we are infringing their intellectual property rights such claims could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition from time to time we receive letters alleging infringement of patents litigation concerning patents or other intellectual property is costly and time consuming we may seek licenses from such parties but they could refuse to grant us a license or demand commercially unreasonable terms we might not have sufficient resources to pay for the licenses such infringement claims could also cause us to incur substantial liabilities and to suspend or permanently cease the use of critical technologies or processes or the production or sale of major products 

failure to obtain required certifications of our products on a timely basis could harm our business 

we have certain products especially in our aviation segment that are subject to governmental and similar certifications before they can be sold for example federal aviation administration ‘‘faa’’ certification is required for all of our aviation products that are intended for installation in type certificated aircraft to the extent required certification is an expensive and timeconsuming process that requires significant focus and resources an inability to obtain or excessive delay in obtaining such certifications could have an adverse effect on our ability to introduce new products and therefore our operating results   in addition we cannot assure you that our certified products will not be decertified any such decertification could have an adverse effect on our operating results 

our business is subject to economic political and other risks associated with international sales and operations 

our business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally we estimate that approximately 38 of our net sales in the fiscal year ended december 31 2005 represented products shipped to international destinations accordingly our business financial condition and results of operations could be harmed by a variety of international factors including 

 

 

we may experience unique economic and political risks associated with companies that operate in taiwan 

relations between taiwan and the people’s republic of china also referred to as the prc and other factors affecting the political or economic conditions of taiwan in the future could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations and the market price and the liquidity of our shares our principal manufacturing facilities where we manufacture all of our products except our panelmounted aviation products are located in taiwan 

taiwan has a unique international political status the prc asserts sovereignty over all of china including taiwan certain other islands and all of mainland china the prc government does not recognize the legitimacy of the taiwan government although significant economic and cultural relations have been established during recent years between taiwan and the prc the prc government has indicated that it may use military force to gain control over taiwan in certain circumstances such as the declaration of independence by taiwan relations between taiwan and the prc have on occasion adversely affected the market value of taiwanese companies and could negatively affect our operations in taiwan in the future 

there is uncertainty as to our shareholders’ ability to enforce certain foreign civil liabilities in the cayman islands and taiwan 

we are a cayman islands company and a substantial portion of our assets are located outside the united states particularly in taiwan as a result it may be difficult to effect service of process within the united states upon us in addition there is uncertainty as to whether the courts of the cayman islands or taiwan would recognize or enforce judgments of united states courts obtained against us predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the united states or any state thereof or be competent to hear original actions brought in the cayman islands or taiwan against us predicated upon the securities laws of the united states or any state thereof 

our shareholders may face difficulties in protecting their interests because we are incorporated under cayman islands law 

our corporate affairs are governed by our memorandum and articles of association as amended and by the companies law 2004 revision and the common law of the cayman islands the rights of our shareholders and the fiduciary responsibilities of our directors under cayman islands law are not as clearly established as under statutes or judicial precedent in existence in jurisdictions in the united states therefore you may have more difficulty in protecting your interests in the face of actions by the management directors or our controlling shareholders than would shareholders of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction in the united states due to the comparatively less developed nature of cayman islands law in this area 

unlike many jurisdictions in the united states cayman islands law does not specifically provide for shareholder appraisal rights on a merger or consolidation of a company this may make it more difficult for you to assess the value of any consideration you may receive in a merger or consolidation or to require that the offeror give you additional consideration if you believe the consideration offered is insufficient 

shareholders of cayman islands exempted companies such as ourselves have no general rights under cayman islands law to inspect corporate records and accounts or to obtain copies of lists of shareholders of the company this may make it more difficult for you to obtain the information needed to establish any facts necessary for a shareholder motion or to solicit proxies from other shareholders in connection with a proxy contest 

subject to limited exceptions under cayman islands law a minority shareholder may not bring a derivative action against the board of directors our cayman islands counsel is not aware of any reported class action or derivative action having been brought in a cayman islands court 

we may pursue strategic acquisitions investments strategic partnerships or other ventures and our business could be materially harmed if we fail to successfully identify complete and integrate such transactions 

we intend to evaluate acquisition opportunities and opportunities to make investments in complementary businesses technologies services or products or to enter into any strategic partnerships with parties who can provide access to those assets additional product or services offerings or additional industry expertise in october 2005 we acquired motionbased technologies llc we currently have no commitments to make any material investments or acquisitions or to enter into strategic partnerships we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition investment or strategic partnership candidates or if we do identify suitable candidates in the future we may not be able to complete those transactions on commercially favorable terms or at all 

any future acquisition could result in difficulties assimilating acquired operations and products and diversion of capital and management’s attention away from other business issues and opportunities integration of acquired companies may result in problems related to integration of technology and inexperienced management teams in addition the key personnel of the acquired company may decide not to work for us our management has had limited experience in assimilating acquired organizations and products into our operations we may not successfully integrate any operations personnel or products that we may acquire in the future if we fail to successfully integrate such transactions our business could be materially harmed 

 

we have benefited in the past from taiwan government tax incentives offered on certain high technology capital investments that may not always be available 

our effective tax rate is lower than the us federal statutory rate because we have benefited from incentives offered in taiwan related to our high technology investments in taiwan the loss of these tax benefits could have a significant effect on our financial results in the future 

changes in our united states federal income tax classification or in applicable tax law could result in adverse tax consequences to our shareholders 

we do not believe that we or any of our nonunited states subsidiaries are currently a ‘‘passive foreign investment company’’ for united states federal income tax purposes we do not expect to become a passive foreign investment company however because the passive foreign investment company determination is made annually on the basis of facts and circumstances that may be beyond our control and because the principles for applying the passive foreign investment company tests are not entirely clear we cannot assure that we will not become a passive foreign investment company if we are a passive foreign investment company in any year then any of our shareholders that is a united states person could be liable to pay tax at ordinary income tax rates plus an interest charge upon some distributions by us or when that shareholder sells our common shares at a gain further if we are classified as a passive foreign investment company in any year in which a united states person is a shareholder we generally will continue to be treated as a passive foreign investment company with respect to such shareholder in all succeeding years regardless of whether we continue to satisfy the income or asset tests described above additional tax considerations would apply if we or any of our subsidiaries were a controlled foreign corporation 

 

risks relating to our shares 

 

the volatility of our stock price could adversely affect investment in our common shares 

the market price of our common shares has been and may continue to be highly volatile during 2005 the closing price of our common shares ranged from a low of 3950 to a high of 7041 a variety of factors could cause the price of our common shares to fluctuate perhaps substantially including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in addition in recent years the stock market in general and the markets for shares of technology companies in particular have experienced extreme price fluctuations which have often been unrelated to the operating performance of affected companies any such fluctuations in the future could adversely affect the market price of our common shares and the market price of our common shares may decline 

 

our officers and directors exert substantial influence over us 

as of february 28 2006 members and former members of our board of directors and our executive officers together with members of their families and entities that may be deemed affiliates of or related to such persons or entities beneficially own approximately 44 of our outstanding common shares accordingly these shareholders may be able to determine the outcome of corporate actions requiring shareholder approval such as mergers and acquisitions this level of ownership may have a significant effect in delaying deferring or preventing a change in control of garmin and may adversely affect the voting and other rights of other holders of our common shares 

provisions in our shareholder rights plan and our charter documents might deter delay or prevent a third party from acquiring us and cayman islands corporate law may impede a takeover which could decrease the value of our shares 

our board of directors has the authority to issue up to 1000000 preferred shares and to determine the price rights preferences privileges and restrictions including voting rights of those shares without any further vote or action by the shareholders this could have an adverse impact on the market price of our common shares we have no present plans to issue any preferred shares but we may do so the rights of the holders of common shares may be subject to and adversely affected by the rights of the holders of any preferred shares that may be issued in the future in addition we have adopted a classified board of directors our shareholders are unable to remove any director or the entire board of directors without a super majority vote in addition a super majority vote is required to approve transactions with interested shareholders shareholders do not have the right to call a shareholders meeting we have adopted a shareholders’ rights plan which under certain circumstances would significantly impair the ability of third parties to acquire control of us without prior approval of our board of directors this shareholders’ rights plan and the provisions in our charter documents could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us even if doing so would benefit our shareholders 

unlike many jurisdictions in the united states cayman islands law does not provide for mergers as that expression is understood under corporate law in the united states while cayman islands law does have statutory provisions that provide for the reconstruction and amalgamation of companies which are commonly referred to in the cayman islands as a “scheme of arrangement” the procedural and legal requirements necessary to consummate these transactions are more rigorous and take longer to complete than the procedures typically required to consummate a merger in the united states under cayman islands law and practice a scheme of arrangement in relation to a solvent cayman islands exempted company must be approved at a shareholders’ meeting by a majority of the company’s shareholders who are present and voting either in person or by proxy at such meeting the shares voted in favor of the scheme of arrangement must also represent at least 75 of the value of each class of the company’s shareholders excluding the shares owned by the parties to the scheme of arrangement present and voting at the meeting the grand court of the cayman islands must also sanction the convening of these meetings and the terms of the amalgamation although there is no requirement to seek the consent of the creditors of the parties involved in the scheme of arrangement the grand court typically seeks to ensure that the creditors have consented to the transfer of their liabilities to the surviving entity or that the scheme of arrangement does not otherwise materially adversely affect the creditors’ interests furthermore the grand court will only approve a scheme of arrangement if it is satisfied that 

• the statutory provisions as to majority vote have been complied with 

• the shareholders have been fairly represented at the meeting in question 

• the scheme of arrangement is such as a businessman would reasonably approve and 

• the scheme of arrangement is not one that would more properly be sanctioned under some other provision of the companies law

overview 

 

we are a leading worldwide provider of navigation communications and information devices most of which are enabled by global positioning system or gps technology we operate in two business segments the consumer and aviation markets both of our segments offer products through our network of independent dealers and distributors however the nature of products and types of customers for the two segments vary significantly as such the segments are managed separately our consumer segment includes portable gps receivers and accessories for marine recreation land and automotive applications sold primarily to retail outlets our aviation products are portable and panelmount avionics for visual flight rules and instrument flight rules navigation and are sold primarily to retail outlets and certain aircraft manufacturers 

since our first products were delivered in 1991 we have generated positive income from operations each year and have funded our growth from these profits our sales have increased at a compounded annual growth rate of 29 since 2001 and our net income has increased at a compounded annual growth rate of 29 since 2001 the vast majority of this growth has been organic only a very small amount of new revenue occurred as a result of the acquisition of ups aviation technologies in 2003 and this acquisition had no significant impact on net income for that year 

since our principal locations are in the united states taiwan and the uk we experience some foreign currency fluctuations in our operating results the functional currency of our european operations is the us dollar effective in 2001 and the functional currency of our asian operations is the new taiwan dollar less than 25 percent of transactions of our european operations are now denominated in british pounds sterling or the euro we experienced 153 million 248 million 67 million 00 million and 116 million in foreign currency gains losses during fiscal years 2005 2004 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively to date we have not entered into hedging transactions with the european dollar the british pound sterling or the new taiwan dollar although we may utilize hedging transactions in the future 

 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

general 

 

the company’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company’s consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the presentation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis the company evaluates its estimates including those related to customer sales programs and incentives product returns bad debts inventories investments intangible assets income taxes warranty obligations and contingencies and litigation the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgements about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

revenue recognition 

 

the company records estimated reductions to revenue for customer sales programs returns and incentive offerings including rebates price protection promotions and other volumebased incentives the reductions to revenue are based on estimates and judgements using historical experience and expectation of future conditions changes in these estimates could negatively affect the company’s operating results these incentives are accrued for on a percentage of sales basis and reviewed periodically if market conditions were to decline the company may take actions to increase customer incentive offerings possibly resulting in an incremental reduction of revenue at the time the incentive is offered 

 

warranties 

 

the company’s products sold are generally covered by a warranty for periods ranging from one to two years the company accrues a warranty reserve for estimated costs to provide warranty services the company’s estimate of costs to service its warranty obligations is based on historical experience and expectation of future conditions to the extent the company experiences increased warranty claim activity or increased costs associated with servicing those claims its warranty accrual will increase resulting in decreased gross profit 

inventory 

 

the company writes down its inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management additional inventory writedowns may be required 

investments 

investments are classified as available for sale and recorded at fair value and unrealized investment gains and losses are reflected in stockholders’ equity investment income is recorded when earned and capital gains and losses are recognized when investments are sold investments are reviewed periodically to determine if they have suffered an impairment of value that is considered other than temporary if investments are determined to be impaired a capital loss is recognized at the date of determination 

testing for impairment of investments also requires significant management judgement the identification of potentially impaired investments the determination of their fair value and the assessment of whether any decline in value is other than temporary are the key judgement elements the discovery of new information and the passage of time can significantly change these judgements revisions of impairment judgements are made when new information becomes known and any resulting impairment adjustments are made at that time the economic environment and volatility of securities markets increase the difficulty of determining fair value and assessing investment impairment 

 

income taxes 

 

the company provides deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the difference between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their carrying amount for financial reporting purposes as measured by the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse while no valuation allowance has been recorded it is the company’s policy to record a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to an amount that it believes is more likely than not to be realized while the company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance in the event the company were to determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax assets in the future an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such determination was made likewise should the company determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase income in the period such determination was made 

in addition the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations we recognize liabilities for tax audit issues in the us and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes will be due if payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary if our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment a further charge to expense would result 

stock based compensation 

the company distributes stock options or stock appreciation rights “sar’s” each year as part of the company’s compensation package for employees employees with certain levels of responsibility within the company are eligible for stock option or sar grants but the granting of options is at the discretion of the compensation committee of the board of directors and is not a contractual obligation stock compensation plans are discussed in detail in note 11 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

accounting terms and characteristics 

net sales 

our net sales are primarily generated through sales to our global dealer and distributor network and to original equipment manufacturers we recognize sales when products are shipped our sales are largely of a consumer nature therefore backlog levels are not necessarily indicative of our future sales results we aim to achieve a quick turnaround on orders we receive and we typically ship most orders within 72 hours 

net sales are subject to some seasonal fluctuation typically sales of our consumer products are highest in the second quarter due to increased demand during the spring and summer marine season and in the fourth quarter due to increased demand during the holiday buying season our aviation products do not experience much seasonal variation but are more influenced by the timing of the release of new products when the initial demand is typically the strongest 

 

gross profit 

 

raw material costs are our most significant cost item in 2005 we experienced a shift in product mix to lowermargin product groups and price declines related to increased competition both in relation to the rapidly growing automotive navigation product line we experienced shortages in certain high technology components in early 2004 as well as upward pricing pressure on components in the first half of 2004 much of which was alleviated by the end of the fiscal year we experienced upward pricing pressures on our high technology components in late 2003 but offset much of those with efficiencies in our manufacturing processes 

our existing practice of performing the design and manufacture of our products inhouse has enabled us to utilize alternative lower cost components from different suppliers and where possible to redesign our products to permit us to use these lower cost components we believe that because of our practice of performing the design manufacture and marketing of our products inhouse our shijr taiwan olathe kansas and salem oregon manufacturing plants have experienced relatively low costs of manufacturing compared to our competition in general products manufactured in taiwan have been our highest volume products our manufacturing labor costs historically have been lower in taiwan than in olathe and salem 

sales price variability has had and can be expected to have an effect on our gross profit in the past prices of some of our devices sold into the consumer market have declined due to market pressures and introduction of new products sold at lower price points the average selling prices of our aviation products have increased due to product mix and the introduction of more advanced products sold at higher prices the effect of the sales price variability inherent within the mix of gpsenabled products sold could have a significant impact on our gross profit 

selling general and administrative expenses 

our selling general and administrative expenses consist primarily of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with the expected increase of total revenues in the future we expect selling general and administrative expenses to continue to increase for the foreseeable future we intend to increase advertising and marketing expenses in order to focus on individual markets and build increased brand awareness in the consumer marketplace especially as we continue to develop new markets and expand opportunities in rapidly growing markets like the portable automobile navigation which is becoming a mass market we also intend to increase our customer call center support as our consumer segment continues to grow we also anticipate increased selling general and administrative costs associated with information technology staffing and support activities 

research and development 

the majority of our research and development costs represent salaries for our engineers costs for high technology components used in product and prototype development and costs of test equipment needed during product development approximately 87 of the research and development of our products is performed in the united states the remainder of our research and development activities are performed by our taiwan engineering group which has increased in size in recent years 

 

we are committed to increasing the level of innovative design and development of new products as we strive for expanded ability to serve our existing consumer and aviation markets as well as new markets for gpsenabled devices we continue to grow our research and development budget in absolute terms 

customers 

 

no customer accounted for 10 or more of our sales in the year ended december 31 2005 our top ten customers have contributed between 25 and 30 of net sales since 2001 we have experienced average sales days in our customer accounts receivable between 35 and 61 days since 2001 the average sales days in our customer accounts receivable was 61 days as of december 31 2005 we have experienced an increase in the level of customer accounts receivable days due to changes in product mix and longer payment terms and anticipate maintaining approximately the current level of accounts receivable days going forward 

 

income taxes 

 

we have experienced a relatively low effective tax rate in taiwan due to lower marginal tax rates and substantial tax incentives offered by the taiwanese government on certain hightechnology capital investments and other taiwan tax credits due to expected repatriation of 2005 earnings therefore profits earned in taiwan have been taxed at a lower rate than those in the united states and europe as a result our consolidated effective tax rate was approximately 165 percent during 2005 we have taken advantage of this tax benefit in taiwan since our inception and we expect to continue to benefit from lower effective tax rates at least through 2010 the current taiwan tax incentives for which garmin has received approval will end in 2010 we plan on applying for additional incentives for years beyond 2010 based on capital investments we expect to make in the future however there can be no assurance that such tax incentives will be available indefinitely or that we will receive the incentives for which we apply management believes that the effective tax rate for fiscal 2006 will be slightly lower than fiscal 2005 the actual effective tax rate will be dependent upon the production volume additional capital investments made during fiscal 2005 and composition of our earnings

comparison of fiscal years ended december 31 2005 and december 25 2004 

net sales 

 

 

 

the increase in total net sales during fiscal 2005 was primarily due to the introduction of 55 new products and overall demand for our consumer and aviation products total consumer and aviation units sold increased 31 to 3028000 in 2005 from 2306000 in 2004 in general management believes that continuous innovation and the introduction of new products are essential for future revenue growth 

the company’s revenues are normally seasonal with the fiscal second and fourth quarter revenues meaningfully higher than the first and third fiscal quarters in 2005 revenues followed this typical seasonal pattern with increases each quarter over the prior year’s quarter due to the impact of new product releases across all product lines the revenue increase in second quarter was primarily attributable to initial sellin of popular new portable automobile navigation products the onset of the marine selling season and father’s day purchases the revenue increase in the fourth quarter was primarily attributable to new product releases and sales associated with the traditional holiday selling season revenues can also be impacted in any given quarter by the timing of new product introductions 

the increase in net sales to consumers was primarily due to the introduction of 40 new consumer products and overall demand for our consumer products as total units sold were up 31 it is management’s belief that the continued demand for the company’s consumer products is due to the expansion of the gps market in general and overall increased consumer awareness of the capabilities and applications of gps particularly as those capabilities pertain to automobile navigation 

the increase in aviation sales for fiscal 2005 was primarily due to increased sales from panel mount products sold into the oem original equipment manufacturers and retrofit markets sales of the g1000 integrated glass cockpit was the primary reason for increased oem sales in 2005 while temporary flight restrictions tfrs continue to impact general aviation the flying community is adapting to these changes and returning to the skies in greater numbers should the federal aviation administration faa impose more restrictions or elect to shutdown us airspace in the future these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business 

 

gross profit 

 

 

the increase in gross profit dollars was primarily attributable to the introduction of 40 new consumer products and overall demand for our consumer and aviation products the reduction in gross margin percentage was primarily due to reduced prices on older consumer products in advance of new product releases a change in product mix towards certain lower gross margin consumer product lines such as the automotive product line and reduced prices on certain consumer products due to increased competition management believes that the trend to lower consumer gross margin percentages will continue in the future as net sales of automotive products increase at a faster rate than the rest of the consumer segment 

 

the increase in aviation gross margin was primarily due to a shift in product mix within our oem and retrofit products as the g1000 product line began a second year of selling into new aircraft and program costs were no longer a significant cost in this business segment 

selling general and administrative expenses 

 

 

the increase in expense was primarily attributable to increases in employment generally across the organization net increase of over 400 nonengineering employees significantly increased advertising costs up 101 associated primarily with consumer products increased information technology staffing and support costs increased staffing in our sales and marketing group to increase focus on specific target markets and additional staffing in our customer call center management expects that in spite of strong demand for our products selling general and administrative expenses will remain relatively flat as a percentage of sales during fiscal 2006 due to increased advertising and marketing activities intended to build awareness of the garmin brand and demand for garmin product worldwide 

research and development expenses 

 

 

the increase in research and development expense was primarily attributable to the addition of 142 associates to our research and development team during fiscal 2005 management believes that one of the key strategic initiatives for future growth and success of the company is continuous innovation development and introduction of new products management expects that its research and development expenses will increase approximately 25  30 during fiscal 2006 on an absolute dollar basis due to the anticipated introduction of approximately 50 new products for fiscal 2006 management expects to continue to invest in the research and development of new products and technology in order to maintain the company’s competitive advantage in the markets in which it competes 

 

 

other income expense 

 

 

other income expense principally consists of interest income interest expense and foreign currency exchange gains and losses other income expense was significantly higher in fiscal 2005 relative to fiscal 2004 with the majority of this difference caused by increased interest income and foreign currency gains in 2005 interest income for fiscal 2005 increased due to higher interest rates and larger cash and marketable securities balances during the year increasing the returns on the company’s cash and cash equivalents 

during fiscal 2005 the company experienced foreign currency exchange gains of 153 million as the us dollar strengthened versus the new taiwan dollar 3284 ntdusd relative to the end of fiscal 2004 3219 ntdusd during fiscal 2004 the company experienced foreign currency exchange losses of 248 million as the us dollar weakened versus the new taiwan dollar 3219 ntdusd relative to the end of fiscal 2003 3405 ntdusd 

income tax provision 

income tax expense increased by 119 million to 614 million for fiscal year 2005 from 495 million for fiscal year 2004 due to our higher taxable income the effective tax rate was 165 for fiscal 2005 versus 194 for fiscal 2004 the decrease in tax rate is due to additional tax benefits received from taiwan as a result of our continued capital investment in our manufacturing facilities in taiwan tax credits resulting from our decision to repatriate certain of our taiwan earnings to our parent company and the increased contribution to our income from lower tax jurisdictions during 2005 relative to 2004 this lower effective tax rate resulted in a decrease in the ratio of income tax as a percentage of revenue of approximately 05 from fiscal 2004 to fiscal 2005 

net income 

as a result of the various factors noted above net income increased 51 to 3112 million for fiscal year 2005 compared to 2057 million for fiscal year 2004 

comparison of fiscal years ended december 25 2004 and december 27 2003 

 

net sales 

 

the increase in total net sales during fiscal 2004 was primarily due to the introduction of 50 new products and overall demand for our consumer and aviation products total consumer and aviation units sold increased 120 to 2306000 in 2004 from 2066000 in 2003 

the company’s revenues are normally seasonal with the fiscal second and fourth quarter revenues meaningfully higher than the first and third fiscal quarters in 2004 however revenues increased each consecutive quarter due to the impact of new product releases across all product lines the revenue increase in third quarter was primarily attributable to initial g1000 cockpit sales the onset of the marine selling season and father’s day purchases the increase in revenues in the third quarter was due to new product releases and delivery of backorders placed during the second quarter the revenue increase in the fourth quarter was primarily attributable to new product releases and sales associated with the traditional holiday selling season revenues can also be impacted in any given quarter by the timing of new product introductions 

the increase in net sales to consumers was primarily due to the introduction of 35 new consumer products and overall demand for our consumer products as total units sold were up 12 it is management’s belief that the continued demand for the company’s consumer products was due to the emergence of the gps market in general and overall increased consumer awareness of the capabilities and applications of gps 

the increase in aviation sales for fiscal 2004 was primarily due to increased sales from panel mount products sold into the oem original equipment manufacturers and retrofit markets and sales from garmin at inc which was acquired during the third quarter of 2003 

gross profit 

 

 

the increase in gross profit dollars was primarily attributable to the introduction of 35 new products and overall demand for our consumer products the reduction in gross margin percentage was primarily due to reduced prices on older products in advance of new product releases a change in product mix towards certain lower gross margin product lines and increases in certain raw material costs early in the fiscal year upward pricing pressure on certain raw materials components in early 2004 generally abated by the end of the year 

the decrease in consumer gross margin was attributable to higher component costs early in the year higher than normal price reductions on older products in advance of the release of 35 new products during the year and a shift in product mix as automotive products became a larger portion of revenue for our consumer products segment 

 

the decrease in aviation gross margin was primarily due to a shift in product mix within our oem and retrofit products as the g1000 product line began selling into new aircraft 

 

selling general and administrative expenses 

 

 

 

 

the increase in expense was primarily attributable to increases in employment generally across the organization net increase of over 400 nonengineering employees significantly increased advertising costs up 33 associated primarily with consumer products oracle software implementation costs and additional staffing in our customer call center in the past selling general and administrative expenses increased at a lower rate than revenues due to strong demand for newly introduced and existing consumer products 

research and development expenses 

 

 

the increase in research and development expense was primarily attributable to the addition of 52 associates to our research and development team during fiscal 2004 and the garmin at engineering team contributing for the full fiscal year 

other income expense 

 

 

other income expense principally consists of interest income interest expense and foreign currency exchange gains and losses other income expense was significantly lower in fiscal 2004 relative to fiscal year 2003 with the majority of this difference caused by foreign currency losses in 2004 interest income for fiscal 2004 increased due to larger cash and marketable securities balances during the year increasing the returns on the company’s cash and cash equivalents interest expense decreased in fiscal 2004 due primarily to the retirement of 20 million of outstanding longterm debt during fiscal 2003 

during fiscal 2004 the company experienced foreign currency exchange losses of 248 million as the us dollar weakened versus the new taiwan dollar 3219 ntdusd relative to the end of fiscal 2003 3405 ntdusd during fiscal 2003 the company experienced foreign currency exchange losses of 67 million as the us dollar weakened versus the new taiwan dollar 3405 ntdusd relative to the end of fiscal 2002 3510 ntdusd 

income tax provision 

 

 

income tax expense increased by 22 million to 495 million for fiscal year 2004 from 473 million for fiscal year 2003 due to our higher taxable income the effective tax rate was 194 for fiscal 2004 versus 209 for fiscal 2003 the decrease in tax rate is due to additional tax benefits received from taiwan as a result of our continued capital investment in our manufacturing facilities in taiwan and the increased contribution to our income from lower tax jurisdictions during 2004 relative to 2003 

net income 

as a result of the various factors noted above net income increased 152 to 2057 million for fiscal year 2004 compared to 1786 million for fiscal year 2003 

liquidity and capital resources 

net cash generated by operations was 2470 million 2089 million and 1735 million for fiscal years 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively we operate with a customeroriented approach and seek to maintain sufficient inventory to meet customer demand because we desire to respond quickly to our customers and minimize order fulfillment time our inventory levels are generally substantial enough to meet most demand we also attempt to carry sufficient inventory levels of key components so that potential supplier shortages have as minimal an impact as possible on our ability to deliver our finished products we significantly increased our finished goods inventories in 2005 in anticipation of new product releases in the first half of 2006 in addition we prefer to have sufficient finished goods on hand to meet anticipated demand for our products raw materials and finished goods inventory levels also continued to grow as a function of our growing sales we anticipate days of inventory to stabilize at current levels in 2006 although absolute dollars of inventory will continue to rise reflecting the growth of our businesses 

capital expenditures in 2005 totaled 271 million a decrease of 510 million from fiscal 2004 this amount in 2005 reflects ordinary capital expenditures for fiscal 2005 during fiscal 2004 our capital expenditures totaled 781 million the expenditures in fiscal 2004 were primarily related to the completion of expansion of our olathe kansas facility 47 million and normal ongoing capital expenditures 31 million 

we have budgeted approximately 50 million of capital expenditures during fiscal 2006 to include the purchase and renovation of an additional manufacturing facility in chungli taiwan normal ongoing capital expenditures and purchases of production machinery and equipment to expand capacity in the shijr taiwan facility 

in addition to capital expenditures in 2005 cash flow used in investing related to the purchase of fixed income securities associated with the investment of our onhand cash balances and approximately 36 million of intangible assets the company’s average return on its investments during fiscal 2005 was approximately 31 in addition to capital expenditures in 2004 cash flow used in investing related to the purchase of fixed income securities associated with the investment of our onhand cash balances and approximately 18 million of intangible assets it is management’s goal to invest the onhand cash consistent with the company’s investment policy which has been approved by the board of directors the investment policy’s primary purpose is to preserve capital maintain an acceptable degree of liquidity and maximize yield within the constraint of maximum safety the company’s average return on its investments during fiscal year 2004 was approximately 17 

cash flow related to financing activities resulted in a net use of cash in 2005 of 709 million during 2005 the company repurchased 638000 shares of its common shares under the 3000000share stock repurchase program that was approved by the board of directors on april 21 2004 and expires on april 30 2006 sources and uses in financing activities during 2005 related primarily to uses for the payment of a dividend 540 million and stock repurchase 267 million and a source of cash from the issuance of common stock related to the exercise of employee stock options and the employee stock purchase plan 97 million cash flow related to financing activities resulted in a net use of cash in 2004 of 511 million during 2004 the company repurchased 100000 shares of its common shares under the 3000000share stock repurchase program sources and uses in financing activities during 2004 related primarily to uses for the payment of a dividend 541 million and stock repurchase 31 million and a source of cash from the issuance of common stock related to the exercise of employee stock options and the employee stock purchase plan 61 million cash flow used in financing activities during 2003 related primarily to the payment of a dividend 540 million and reduction of our debt 200 million the company retired approximately 200 million of longterm debt during fiscal 2003 which represented the remainder of an outstanding issue of industrial revenue bonds the employee stock option exercises and employee stock purchase plan purchases generated a 43 million source of cash in 2003 

 

we currently use cash flow from operations to fund our capital expenditures and to support our working capital requirements we expect that future cash requirements will principally be for capital expenditures and working capital requirements 

cash dividends paid to shareholders were 540 million 541 million and 540 million during fiscal years 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively 

we believe that our existing cash balances and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our projected capital expenditures working capital and other cash requirements at least through the end of fiscal 2008 

contractual obligations and commercial commitments 

future payments due from the company as of december 31 2005 aggregated by type of contractual obligation are 

 

 

operating leases describes a lease obligation associated with the garmin europe facility in the united kingdom and a lease obligation associated with garmin at purchase obligations are the aggregate of those purchase orders that were outstanding on december 31 2005 these obligations are created and then paid off within 3 months during the normal course of our manufacturing business 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we do not have any offbalance sheet arrangements 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

 

market sensitivity 

 

we have market risk primarily in connection with the pricing of our products and services and the purchase of raw materials product pricing and raw materials costs are both significantly influenced by semiconductor market conditions historically during cyclical industry downturns we have been able to offset pricing declines for our products through a combination of improved product mix and success in obtaining price reductions in raw materials costs 

inflation 

we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our business financial condition or results of operations if our costs were to become subject to significant inflationary pressures we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs through price increases our inability or failure to do so could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

the operation of the company’s subsidiaries in international markets results in exposure to movements in currency exchange rates we generally have not been significantly affected by foreign exchange fluctuations because until recently the new taiwan dollar has proven to be relatively stable however periodically we have experienced significant foreign currency gains and losses due to the strengthening and weakening of the us dollar the potential of volatile foreign exchange rate fluctuations in the future could have a significant effect on our results of operations 

the principal currency involved is the new taiwan dollar garmin corporation located in shijr taiwan uses the local currency as the functional currency the company translates all assets and liabilities at yearend exchange rates and income and expense accounts at average rates during the year in order to minimize the effect of the currency exchange fluctuations on our net assets we have elected to retain most of our taiwan subsidiary’s cash and investments in marketable securities in us dollars as discussed above the new taiwan dollarus dollar exchange rate can be volatile the exchange rate increased 20 during 2005 and resulted in a foreign currency gain of 153 million the exchange rate decreased 55 during 2004 and resulted in a foreign currency loss of 248 million the exchange rate decreased 30 during 2003 and resulted in a foreign currency loss of 67 million a 10 positive or negative change in the us dollar exchange rate versus the new taiwan dollar would have resulted in a foreign currency gain of 765 million positive 10 change or a foreign currency loss of 765 million negative 10 change during 2005 the majority of our worldwide sales are transacted in us dollars therefore the impact on sales related to foreign currency movements is minimal 

interest rate risk 

we have no outstanding longterm debt and therefore no debtrelated interest rate risk 

we are exposed to interest rate risk in connection with our investments in marketable securities as interest rates change the unrealized gains and losses associated with those securities will fluctuate accordingly a hypothetical change of 10 in interest rates would not have a material effect on such unrealized gains or losses at december 31 2005 unrealized losses on those securities were 33 million

unless otherwise indicated dollar amounts set forth in the tables are in thousands except per share data 

overview we are a leading worldwide provider of navigation communications and information devices most of which are enabled by global positioning system or gps technology we operate in two business segments the consumer and aviation markets both of our segments offer products through our network of independent dealers and distributors however the nature of products and types of customers for the two segments vary significantly as such the segments are managed separately our consumer segment includes portable gps receivers and accessories for marine recreation land and automotive applications sold primarily to retail outlets our aviation products are portable and panelmount avionics for visual flight rules and instrument flight rules navigation and are sold primarily to retail outlets and certain aircraft manufacturers 

since our first products were delivered in 1991 we have generated positive income from operations each year and have funded our growth from these profits our sales have increased at a compounded annual growth rate of 22 since 2000 and our net income has increased at a compounded annual growth rate of 18 since 2000 the vast majority of this growth has been organic only a very small amount of new revenue occurred as a result of the acquisition of ups aviation technologies in 2003 and this acquisition had no significant impact on net income for that year 

since our principal locations are in the united states taiwan and the uk we experience some foreign currency fluctuations in our operating results the functional currency of our european operations is the us dollar effective in 2001 and the functional currency of our asian operations is the new taiwan dollar less than 25 percent of transactions of our european operations are now denominated in british pounds sterling or the euro we experienced 248 million 67 million 00 million 116 million and 70 million in foreign currency gains losses during fiscal years 2004 2003 2002 2001 and 2000 respectively to date we have not entered into hedging transactions with the european dollar the british pound sterling or the new taiwan dollar although we may utilize hedging transactions in the future 

critical accounting policies and estimates general 

the company’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company’s consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the presentation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgements that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis the company evaluates its estimates including those related to customer sales programs and incentives product returns bad debts inventories investments intangible assets income taxes warranty obligations and contingencies and litigation the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgements about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

revenue recognition 

the company records estimated reductions to revenue for customer sales programs returns and incentive offerings including rebates price protection promotions and other volumebased incentives the reductions to revenue are based on estimates and judgements using historical experience and expectation of future conditions changes in these estimates could negatively affect the company’s operating results these incentives are accrued for on a percentage of sales basis and reviewed periodically if market conditions were to decline the company may take actions to increase customer incentive offerings possibly resulting in an incremental reduction of revenue at the time the incentive is offered 

warranties 

the company’s products sold are generally covered by a warranty for periods ranging from one to two years the company accrues a warranty reserve for estimated costs to provide warranty services the company’s estimate of costs to service its warranty obligations is based on historical experience and expectation of future conditions to the extent the company experiences increased warranty claim activity or increased costs associated with servicing those claims its warranty accrual will increase resulting in decreased gross profit 

inventory 

the company writes down its inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management additional inventory writedowns may be required 

investments 

investments are classified as available for sale and recorded at fair value and unrealized investment gains and losses are reflected in stockholders’ equity investment income is recorded when earned and capital gains and losses are recognized when investments are sold investments are reviewed periodically to determine if they have suffered an impairment of value that is considered other than temporary if investments are determined to be impaired a capital loss is recognized at the date of determination 

testing for impairment of investments also requires significant management judgement the identification of potentially impaired investments the determination of their fair value and the assessment of whether any decline in value is other than temporary are the key judgement elements the discovery of new information and the passage of time can significantly change these judgements revisions of impairment judgements are made when new information becomes known and any resulting impairment adjustments are made at that time the economic environment and volatility of securities markets increase the difficulty of determining fair value and assessing investment impairment 

income taxes the company provides deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the difference between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their carrying amount for financial reporting purposes as measured by the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse while no valuation allowance has been recorded it is the company’s policy to record a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to an amount that it believes is more likely than not to be realized while the company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance in the event the company were to determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax assets in the future an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such determination was made likewise should the company determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase income in the period such determination was made 

in addition the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations we recognize liabilities for tax audit issues in the us and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes will be due if payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary if our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment a further charge to expense would result 

stock based compensation 

the company distributes a relatively small number of stock options each year as part of the company’s compensation package for employees employees with certain levels of responsibility within the company are eligible for stock option grants but the granting of options is at the discretion of the compensation committee of the board of directors and is not a contractual obligation stock compensation plans are discussed in detail in note 11 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

accounting terms and characteristics 

net sales 

our net sales are primarily generated through sales to our global dealer and distributor network and to original equipment manufacturers we recognize sales when products are shipped our sales are largely of a consumer nature therefore backlog levels are not necessarily indicative of our future sales results we aim to achieve a quick turnaround on orders we receive and we typically ship most orders within 72 hours 

net sales are subject to some seasonal fluctuation typically sales of our consumer products are highest in the second quarter due to increased demand during the spring and summer marine season and in the fourth quarter due to increased demand during the holiday buying season our aviation products do not experience much seasonal variation but are more influenced by the timing of the release of new products when the initial demand is typically the strongest 

gross profit 

raw material costs are our most significant cost item we did not experience significant pricing pressure on high technology components in fiscal 2001 and 2002 we experienced upward pricing pressures on our high technology components in late 2003 but offset much of those with efficiencies in our manufacturing processes we experienced shortages in certain high technology components in early 2004 as well as upward pricing pressure on components in the first half of 2004 much of which was alleviated by the end of the fiscal year our existing practice of performing the design and manufacture of our products inhouse has enabled us to utilize alternative lower cost components from different suppliers and where possible to redesign our products to permit us to use these lower cost components we believe that because of our practice of performing the design manufacture and marketing of our products inhouse our shijr taiwan olathe kansas and salem oregon manufacturing plants have experienced relatively low costs of manufacturing compared to our competition in general products manufactured in taiwan have been our highest volume products our manufacturing labor costs historically have been lower in taiwan than in olathe and salem 

sales price variability has had and can be expected to have an effect on our gross profit in the past prices of some of our devices sold into the consumer market have declined due to market pressures and introduction of new products sold at lower price points the average selling prices of our aviation products have increased due to product mix and the introduction of more advanced products sold at higher prices the effect of the sales price variability inherent within the mix of gpsenabled products sold could have a significant impact on our gross profit 

selling general and administrative expenses 

our selling general and administrative expenses consist primarily of 

 • salaries for sales and marketing personnel 

 • salaries and related costs for executives and administrative personnel 

 • advertising marketing and other brand building costs 

 • accounting and legal costs 

 • information systems and infrastructure costs 

 • travel and related costs and 

 • occupancy and other overhead costs 

with the expected increase of total revenues in the future we expect selling general and administrative expenses to continue to increase for the foreseeable future we intend to increase advertising and marketing expenses in order to build increased brand awareness in the consumer marketplace especially as we continue to develop new markets such as automotive and personal digital assistants pda we also intend to increase our customer call center support as our consumer segment continues to grow another cause of increased selling general and administrative costs was the continued implementation of an oracle enterprise resource planning erp system during fiscal 2004 and associated information system staffing needed to support oracle 

research and development 

the majority of our research and development costs represent salaries for our engineers costs for high technology components used in product and prototype development and costs of test equipment needed during product development substantially all of the research and development of our products is performed in the united states 

we are committed to increasing the level of innovative design and development of new products as we strive for expanded ability to serve our existing consumer and aviation markets as well as new markets for gpsenabled devices we continue to grow our research and development budget on absolute terms research and development expenses may also grow at a faster rate when compared to our projected revenue growth for fiscal year 2005 

customers 

no customer accounted for greater than 10 of our sales in the year ended december 25 2004 our top ten customers have contributed between 25 and 30 of net sales since 2001 we have experienced average sales days in our customer accounts receivable between 35 and 53 days since 2001 the average sales days in our customer accounts receivable was 53 days as of december 25 2004 we have experienced an increase in the level of customer accounts receivable days due to changes in product mix and longer payment terms and anticipate maintaining approximately the current level of accounts receivable days going forward 

income taxes 

we have experienced a relatively low effective tax rate in taiwan due to lower marginal tax rates and substantial tax incentives offered by the taiwanese government on certain hightechnology capital investments therefore profits earned in taiwan have been taxed at a lower rate than those in the united states and europe as a result our consolidated effective tax rate was approximately 194 percent during 2004 we have taken advantage of this tax benefit in taiwan since our inception and we expect to continue to benefit from lower effective tax rates at least through 2009 the current taiwan tax incentives for which garmin has received approval will end in 2009 we plan on applying for additional incentives for years beyond 2009 based on capital investments we expect to make in the future however there can be no assurance that such tax incentives will be available indefinitely or that we will receive the incentives for which we apply 

results of operations the following table sets forth our results of operations as a percentage of net sales during the periods shown 

 25 

the following table sets forth our results of operations for each of our two segments through income before taxes during the period shown for each line item in the table the total of the consumer and aviation segments’ amounts equals the amount in the consolidated statements of income data included in item 6 

 comparison of fiscal years ended december 25 2004 and december 27 2003 net sales 

 the increase in total net sales during fiscal 2004 was primarily due to the introduction of 50 new products and overall demand for our consumer and aviation products total consumer and aviation units sold increased 120 to 2306000 in 2004 from 2066000 in 2003 in general management believes that continuous innovation and the introduction of new products are essential for future revenue growth 

the company’s revenues are normally seasonal with the fiscal second and fourth quarter revenues meaningfully higher than the first and third fiscal quarters in 2004 however revenues increased each consecutive quarter due to the impact of new product releases across all product lines the revenue increase in third quarter was primarily attributable to initial g1000 cockpit sales the onset of the marine selling season and father’s day purchases the increase in revenues in the third quarter was due to new product releases and delivery of backorders placed during the second quarter the revenue increase in the fourth quarter was primarily attributable to new product releases and sales associated with the traditional holiday selling season revenues can also be impacted in any given quarter by the timing of new product introductions 

the increase in net sales to consumers was primarily due to the introduction of 35 new consumer products and overall demand for our consumer products as total units sold were up 12 it is management’s belief that the continued demand for the company’s consumer products is due to the emergence of the gps market in general and overall increased consumer awareness of the capabilities and applications of gps 

the increase in aviation sales for fiscal 2004 was primarily due to increased sales from panel mount products sold into the oem original equipment manufacturers and retrofit markets and sales from garmin at inc which was acquired during the third quarter of 2003 while temporary flight restrictions tfr’s continue to impact general aviation the flying community is adapting to these changes and returning to the skies in greater numbers should the federal aviation administration faa impose more restrictions or elect to shutdown us airspace in the future these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business 

gross profit 

 the increase in gross profit dollars was primarily attributable to the introduction of 35 new products and overall demand for our consumer products the reduction in gross margin percentage was primarily due to reduced prices on older products in advance of new product releases a change in product mix towards certain lower gross margin product lines and increases in certain raw material costs early in the fiscal year upward pricing pressure on certain raw materials components in early 2004 generally abated by the end of the year 

the decrease in consumer gross margin was attributable to higher component costs early in the year higher than normal price reductions on older products in advance of the release of 35 new products during the year and a shift in product mix as automotive products became a larger portion of revenue for our consumer products segment 

the decrease in aviation gross margin was primarily due to a shift in product mix within our oem and retrofit products as the g1000 product line began selling into new aircraft 

selling general and administrative expenses 

 the increase in expense was primarily attributable to increases in employment generally across the organization net increase of over 400 nonengineering employees significantly increased advertising costs up 33 associated primarily with consumer products oracle software implementation costs and additional staffing in our customer call center in the past selling general and administrative expenses increased at a lower rate than revenues due to strong demand for newly introduced and existing consumer products management expects that in spite of strong demand for our products selling general and administrative expenses will remain flat or increase slightly as a percentage of sales during fiscal 2005 due to higher depreciation costs associated with the expanded facilities in olathe kansas 

research and development expenses 

 the increase in research and development expense was primarily attributable to the addition of 52 associates to our research and development team during fiscal 2004 and the garmin at engineering team contributing for the full fiscal year management believes that one of the key strategic initiatives for future growth and success of the company is continuous innovation development and introduction of new products management expects that its research and development expenses will increase approximately 20 to 25 during fiscal 2005 on an absolute dollar basis due to the anticipated introduction of approximately 60 new products for fiscal 2005 management expects to continue to invest in the research and development of new products and technology in order to maintain the company’s competitive advantage in the markets in which it competes 

other income expense 

 other income expense principally consists of interest income interest expense and foreign currency exchange gains and losses other income expense was significantly lower in fiscal 2004 relative to fiscal year 2003 with the majority of this difference caused by foreign currency losses in 2004 interest income for fiscal 2004 increased due to larger cash and marketable securities balances during the year increasing the returns on the company’s cash and cash equivalents interest expense decreased in fiscal 2004 due primarily to the retirement of 20 million of outstanding longterm debt during fiscal 2003 

during fiscal 2004 the company experienced foreign currency exchange losses of 248 million as the us dollar weakened versus the new taiwan dollar 3219 ntdusd relative to the end of fiscal 2003 3405 ntdusd during fiscal 2003 the company experienced foreign currency exchange losses of 67 million as the us dollar weakened versus the new taiwan dollar 3405 ntdusd relative to the end of fiscal 2002 3510 ntdusd 

income tax provision 

income tax expense increased by 22 million to 495 million for fiscal year 2004 from 473 million for fiscal year 2003 due to our higher taxable income the effective tax rate was 194 for fiscal 2004 versus 209 for fiscal 2003 the decrease in tax rate is due to additional tax benefits received from taiwan as a result of our continued capital investment in our manufacturing facilities in taiwan and the increased contribution to our income from lower tax jurisdictions during 2004 relative to 2003 management believes that the effective tax rate for fiscal 2005 will be comparable to fiscal 2004 the actual effective tax rate will be dependent upon the production volume additional capital investments made during fiscal 2005 and composition of our earnings 

net inco me 

as a result of the various factors noted above net income increased 152 to 2057 million for fiscal year 2004 compared to 1786 million for fiscal year 2003 

comparison of fiscal years ended december 27 2003 and december 28 2002 net sales 

 the increase in total net sales during fiscal 2003 was primarily due to the introduction of 16 new products and overall demand for our consumer products total consumer and aviation units sold increased 330 to 2066000 in 2003 from 1557000 in 2002 in general management believes that continuous innovation and the introduction of new products are essential for future revenue growth 

the company’s revenues are seasonal with the fiscal second and fourth quarter revenues meaningfully higher than the first and third fiscal quarters the revenue increase in second quarter is primarily attributable to the onset of the marine selling season and secondarily father’s day purchases and the revenue increase in the fourth quarter is primarily attributable to the traditional holiday selling season revenues can also be impacted in any given quarter by the timing of new product introductions 

the increase in net sales to consumers was primarily due to the introduction of 16 new consumer products and overall demand for our consumer products as total units sold were up 33 it is management’s belief that the continued demand for the company’s consumer products is due to the emergence of the gps market in general and overall increased consumer awareness of the capabilities and applications of gps 

the increase in aviation sales for fiscal 2003 was primarily due to increased sales from panel mount products sold into the retrofit market and sales from ups aviation technologies now garmin at inc which was acquired during the third quarter of 2003 

gross profit 

 the increase in gross profit was primarily attributable to the introduction of 16 new products and overall demand for our consumer products the improvement in gross margin was primarily due to the introduction of new higher margin products improved manufacturing efficiencies on many of the new products introduced throughout the year and reductions of certain material costs early in the fiscal year the company experienced upward pricing pressure on certain raw materials components in the latter part of 2003 

the increase in consumer gross margin was primarily attributable to the introduction of 16 new consumer products and overall demand for our consumer products 

the increase in aviation gross profit was primarily due to improved product mix within our oem and retrofit products partially offset by certain lower gross profit margin products as a result of the acquisition of ups aviation technologies 

selling general and administrative expenses 

 the increase in expense was primarily attributable to increases in employment generally across the organization net increase of approximately 300 nonengineering employees significantly increased advertising costs up 32 associated primarily with consumer products oracle software implementation costs and additional staffing in our customer call center in the past selling general and administrative expenses increased at a lower rate than revenues due to strong demand for newly introduced and existing consumer products 

research and development expenses 

 the increase in research and development expense was primarily attributable to the addition of 50 ups aviation technologies engineering associates to our aviation research and development team and the addition of 100 new engineers to our research and development teams during fiscal 2003 management believes that one of the key strategic initiatives for future growth and success of the company is continuous innovation development and introduction of new products 

other income expens e 

 other income expense principally consists of interest income interest expense and foreign currency exchange gains and losses other income expense was significantly lower in fiscal 2003 relative to fiscal year 2002 with the majority of this difference caused by foreign currency losses in 2003 interest income for fiscal 2003 increased due to larger cash and marketable securities balances during the year increasing the returns on the company’s cash and cash equivalents interest expense decreased for fiscal 2003 relative to fiscal 2002 due primarily to the retirement of 20 million of outstanding longterm debt during fiscal 2003 

during fiscal 2003 the company experienced foreign currency exchange losses of 67 million as the us dollar weakened versus the new taiwan dollar 3405 ntdusd relative to the end of fiscal 2002 3490 ntdusd during fiscal 2002 the company’s position was neutral with regard to foreign currency exchange gains and losses and the us dollar was at approximately the same level at the beginning of 2002 relative to the new taiwan dollar 3517 ntdusd as it was at the end of fiscal 2002 3490 ntdusd 

income tax provision 

income tax expense increased by 74 million to 473 million for fiscal year 2003 from 399 million for fiscal year 2002 due to our higher taxable income the effective tax rate was 209 for fiscal 2003 versus 219 for fiscal 2002 the decrease in tax rate was due primarily to additional tax benefits received from taiwan as a result of our continued capital investment in our manufacturing facilities there 

net income 

as a result of the various factors noted above net income increased 251 to 1786 million for fiscal year 2003 compared to 1428 million for fiscal year 2002 

liquidity and capital resources net cash generated by operations was 2089 millon 1735 million and 1619 million for fiscal years 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively we operate with a customeroriented approach and seek to maintain sufficient inventory to meet customer demand because we desire to respond quickly to our customers and minimize order fulfillment time our inventory levels are generally substantial enough to meet most demand we also attempt to carry sufficient inventory levels of key components so that potential supplier shortages have as minimal an impact as possible on our ability to deliver our finished products we significantly increased our raw material and finished goods inventories in 2004 in anticipation of new product releases in the first half of 2005 in addition we prefer to have sufficient finished goods on hand to meet anticipated demand for our products finished goods inventory levels also continued to grow as a function of our growing sales we expect that raw materials inventory levels may decrease during fiscal 2005 as lead times for key components decrease 

capital expenditures in 2004 totaled 781 million an increase of 453 million over fiscal 2003 this increase in 2004 was primarily attributable to expansion of our olathe kansas facility 47 million and maintenance capital expenditures 31 million during fiscal 2003 our capital expenditures totaled 328 million the expenditures in fiscal 2003 were primarily related to the initiation of expansion of our olathe kansas facility 17 million and maintenance capital expenditures 158 million 

we have budgeted approximately 25 million of capital expenditures during fiscal 2005 to include normal ongoing capital expenditures and purchases of production machinery and equipment to expand capacity in the shijr taiwan facility 

in addition to capital expenditures in 2004 cash flow used in investing related to the purchase of fixed income securities associated with the investment of our onhand cash balances and approximately 18 million of intangible assets the company’s average return on its investments during fiscal 2004 was approximately 17 in addition to capital expenditures in 2003 cash flow used in investing relates to the 382 million acquisition of ups aviation technologies renamed garmin at the purchase of fixed income securities associated with the investment of our onhand cash balances and approximately 06 million of intangible assets it is management’s goal to invest the onhand cash consistent with the company’s investment policy which has been approved by the board of directors the investment policy’s primary purpose is to preserve capital maintain an acceptable degree of liquidity and maximize yield within the constraint of maximum safety the company’s average return on its investments during fiscal year 2003 was approximately 15 

cash flow related to financing activities resulted in a net use of cash in 2004 of 511 million during 2004 the company repurchased 100000 shares of its common shares under the 3000000share stock repurchase program that was approved by the board of directors on april 21 2004 and expires on april 30 2006 sources and uses in financing activities during 2004 related primarily to uses for the payment of a dividend 541 million and stock repurchase 31 million and a source of cash from the issuance of common stock related to the exercise of employee stock options and the employee stock purchase plan 61 million cash flow used in financing activities during 2003 related primarily to the payment of a dividend 540 million and reduction of our debt 200 million the company retired approximately 200 million of longterm debt during fiscal 2003 which represented the remainder of an outstanding issue of industrial revenue bonds the employee stock option exercises and employee stock purchase plan purchases generated a 43 million source of cash in 2003 cash flow used in financing activities during 2002 relates primarily to the reduction of our debt the company retired approximately 122 million of its longterm debt during fiscal 2002 consisting in good part of an outstanding issue of industrial revenue bonds the employee stock purchase plan and stock option exercises were a 21 million source of cash in 2002 

we currently use cash flow from operations to fund our capital expenditures and to support our working capital requirements we expect that future cash requirements will principally be for capital expenditures and working capital requirements 

cash dividends paid to shareholders were 541 million 540 million and 00 million during fiscal years 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively 

we believe that our existing cash balances and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our projected capital expenditures working capital and other cash requirements at least through the end of fiscal 2005 

contractual obligations and commercial commitments 

future payments due from the company as of december 25 2004 aggregated by type of contractual obligation are 

 operating leases describes a lease obligation associated with the garmin europe facility in the united kingdom and a lease obligation associated with garmin at purchase obligations are the aggregate of those purchase orders that were outstanding on december 25 2004 these obligations are created and then paid off within 3 months during the normal course of our manufacturing business 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we do not have any offbalance sheet arrangements 

companyspecific trends and risks   you should carefully consider the risks described below regarding an investment in our common shares the risks described below are not the only ones facing our company additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also impair our business operations if any of the following risks occur our business financial condition or operating results could be materially adversely affected 

risks related to the company 

our global positioning system products depend upon satellites maintained by the united states department of defense if a significant number of these satellites become inoperable unavailable or are not replaced or if the policies of the united states government for the use of the global positioning system without charge are changed or if there is interference with global positioning system signals our business will suffer 

the global positioning system is a satellitebased navigation and positioning system consisting of a constellation of orbiting satellites the satellites and their ground control and monitoring stations are maintained and operated by the united states department of defense the department of defense does not currently charge users for access to the satellite signals these satellites and their ground support systems are complex electronic systems subject to electronic and mechanical failures and possible sabotage the satellites were originally designed to have lives of 75 years and are subject to damage by the hostile space environment in which they operate however of the current deployment of satellites in place some have been operating for more than 13 years 

if a significant number of satellites were to become inoperable unavailable or are not replaced it would impair the current utility of our global positioning system products and would have a material negative effect on our business in addition there can be no assurance that the us government will remain committed to the operation and maintenance of global positioning system satellites over a long period or that the policies of the us government that provide for the use of the global positioning system without charge and without accuracy degradation will remain unchanged because of the increasing commercial applications of the global positioning system other us government agencies may become involved in the administration or the regulation of the use of global positioning system signals however in a presidential policy statement issued in december 2004 the bush administration stated that the us is committed to supporting and improving the global positioning system and will continue providing it free from direct user fees 

some of our products also use signals from systems that augment gps such as the wide area augmentation system waas waas is operated by the federal aviation administration any curtailment of the operating capability of waas could result in decreased user capability for many of our aviation products thereby impacting our markets 

any of the foregoing factors could affect the willingness of buyers of our products to select global positioning systembased products instead of products based on competing technologies 

a shut down of us airspace would harm our business on september 11 2001 terrorists hijacked and crashed four passenger aircraft operated by commercial air carriers resulting in major loss of life and property following the terrorist attacks the federal aviation administration “faa” ordered all aircraft operating in the us to be grounded for several days in addition to this shut down of us airspace the general aviation industry was further impacted by the additional restrictions implemented by the faa on those flights that fly utilizing visual flight rules vfr the faa restricted vfr flight inside 30 enhanced class b a 2025 mile radius around the 30 largest metropolitan areas in the usa airspace areas the aircraft owners and pilots association aopa estimated that these restrictions affected approximately 41800 general aviation aircraft based at 282 airports inside the 30 enhanced class b airspace areas the aopa estimates that approximately 90 of all general aviation flights are conducted vfr and that only 15 of general aviation pilots are current to fly utilizing instrument flight rules ifr 

the shut down of us airspace following september 11 2001 caused reduced sales of our general aviation products and delays in the shipment of our products manufactured in our taiwan manufacturing facility to our distribution facility in olathe kansas thereby adversely affecting our ability to supply new and existing products to our dealers and distributors 

any future shut down of us airspace or imposition of restrictions on general aviation could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results 

any reallocation of radio frequency spectrum could cause interference with the reception of global positioning system signals this interference could harm our business 

our global positioning system technology is dependent on the use of the standard positioning service sps provided by the us government’s global positioning system satellites the global positioning system operates in radio frequency bands that are globally allocated for radio navigation satellite services the assignment of spectrum is controlled by an international organization known as the international telecommunications union “itu” the federal communications commission “fcc” is responsible for the assignment of spectrum for nongovernment use in the united states in accordance with itu regulations any itu or fcc reallocation of radio frequency spectrum including frequency band segmentation or sharing of spectrum could cause interference with the reception of global positioning system signals and may materially and adversely affect the utility and reliability of our products which would in turn have a material adverse effect on our operating results in addition emissions from mobile satellite service and other equipment operating in adjacent frequency bands or inband may materially and adversely affect the utility and reliability of our products which could result in a material adverse effect on our operating results the fcc continually receives proposals for new technologies and services such as ultrawideband technologies which may seek to operate in or across the radio frequency bands currently used by the gps sps adverse decisions by the fcc that result in harmful interference to the delivery of the gps sps may materially and adversely affect the utility and reliability of our products which could result in a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition 

if we are not successful in the continued development introduction or timely manufacture of new products demand for our products could decrease 

we expect that a significant portion of our future revenue will continue to be derived from sales of newly introduced products the market for our products is characterized by rapidly changing technology evolving industry standards and changes in customer needs if we fail to modify or improve our products in response to changes in technology industry standards or customer needs our products could rapidly become less competitive or obsolete we must continue to make significant investments in research and development in order to continue to develop new products enhance existing products and achieve market acceptance for such products however there can be no assurance that development stage products will be successfully completed or if developed will achieve significant customer acceptance 

if we are unable to successfully develop and introduce competitive new products and enhance our existing products our future results of operations would be adversely affected our pursuit of necessary technology may require substantial time and expense we may need to license new technologies to respond to technological change these licenses may not be available to us on terms that we can accept or may materially change the gross profits that we are able to obtain on our products we may not succeed in adapting our products to new technologies as they emerge development and manufacturing schedules for technology products are difficult to predict and there can be no assurance that we will achieve timely initial customer shipments of new products the timely availability of these products in volume and their acceptance by customers are important to our future success we have previously experienced delays in shipping certain of our products and any future delays whether due to product development delays manufacturing delays lack of market acceptance delays in regulatory approval or otherwise could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

if we do not correctly anticipate demand for our products we may not be able to secure sufficient quantities or costeffective production of our products or we could have costly excess production or inventories 

historically we have experienced steady increases in demand for our products although we did experience a decline in demand for our aviation products in 2001 due to declining economic conditions and the shut down of us airspace as a result of the terrorist attacks that occurred on september 11 2001 and we have generally been able to increase production to meet that demand however the demand for our products depends on many factors and will be difficult to forecast we expect that it will become more difficult to forecast demand as we introduce and support multiple products and as competition in the market for our products intensifies significant unanticipated fluctuations in demand could cause the following problems in our operations 

   we may become subject to significant product liability costs if our aviation products malfunction or contain errors or defects airplane collisions or crashes could occur resulting in property damage personal injury or death malfunctions or errors or defects in our marine navigational products could cause boats to run aground or cause other wreckage personal injury or death if any of these events occurs we could be subject to significant liability for personal injury and property damage we maintain insurance against accidentrelated risks involving our products however there can be no assurance that such insurance would be sufficient to cover the cost of damages to others or that such insurance will continue to be available at commercially reasonable rates if we are unable to maintain sufficient insurance to cover product liability costs our business could be harmed 

we depend on our suppliers some of which are the sole source for specific components and our production would be seriously harmed if these suppliers are not able to meet our demand and alternative sources are not available or if the costs of components rise 

we are dependent on third party suppliers for various components used in our current products some of the components that we procure from third party suppliers include semiconductors and electroluminescent panels liquid crystal displays memory chips and microprocessors the cost quality and availability of components are essential to the successful production and sale of our products some components we use are from sole source suppliers certain applicationspecific integrated circuits incorporating our proprietary designs are manufactured for us by sole source suppliers alternative sources may not be currently available for these sole source components 

in the past including in the first half of 2004 we have experienced shortages of liquid crystal displays and other components in addition if there are shortages in supply of components the costs of such components may rise if suppliers are unable to meet our demand for components on a timely basis and if we are unable to obtain an alternative source or if the price of the alternative source is prohibitive or if the costs of components rise our ability to maintain timely and costeffective production of our products would be seriously harmed 

we license mapping data for use in our products from various sources there are only a limited number of suppliers of mapping data for each geographical region if we are unable to continue licensing such mapping data and are unable to obtain an alternative source or if the price of the alternative source is prohibitive our ability to supply mapping data for use in our products would be seriously harmed 

we rely on independent dealers and distributors to sell our products and disruption to these channels would harm our business 

because we sell a majority of our products to independent dealers and distributors we are subject to many risks including risks related to their inventory levels and support for our products in particular our dealers and distributors maintain significant levels of our products in their inventories if dealers and distributors attempt to reduce their levels of inventory or if they do not maintain sufficient levels to meet customer demand our sales could be negatively impacted 

many of our dealers and distributors also sell products offered by our competitors if our competitors offer our dealers and distributors more favorable terms those dealers and distributors may deemphasize or decline to carry our products in the future we may not be able to retain or attract a sufficient number of qualified dealers and distributors if we are unable to maintain successful relationships with dealers and distributors or to expand our distribution channels our business will suffer 

failure to manage our growth and expansion effectively could adversely impact our business 

our ability to successfully offer our products and implement our business plan in a rapidly evolving market requires an effective planning and management process we continue to increase the scope of our operations domestically and internationally and have grown our shipments and headcount substantially this growth has placed and our anticipated growth in future operations will continue to place a significant strain on our management systems and resources 

our business may suffer if we are not able to hire and retain sufficient qualified personnel or if we lose our key personnel 

our future success depends partly on the continued contribution of our key executive engineering sales marketing manufacturing and administrative personnel we currently do not have employment agreements with any of our key executive officers we do not have key man life insurance on any of our key executive officers and do not currently intend to obtain such insurance the loss of the services of any of our senior level management or other key employees could harm our business recruiting and retaining the skilled personnel we require to maintain our market position may be difficult for example in some recent years there has been a nationwide shortage of qualified electrical engineers and software engineers who are necessary for us to design and develop new products and therefore it has sometimes been challenging to recruit such personnel if we fail to hire and retain qualified employees we may not be able to maintain and expand our business 

our sales and gross margins for our products may fluctuate or erode 

our sales and gross margins for our products may fluctuate from period to period due to a number of factors including product mix competition and unit volumes in particular the average selling prices of a specific product tend to decrease over that product’s life to offset such decreases we intend to rely primarily on obtaining yield improvements and corresponding cost reductions in the manufacture of existing products and on introducing new products that incorporate advanced features and therefore can be sold at higher average selling prices however there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain any such yield improvements or cost reductions or introduce any such new products in the future to the extent that such cost reductions and new product introductions do not occur in a timely manner or our products do not achieve market acceptance our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected as we introduce new product lines that serve personal digital assistant “pda” and original equipment manufacturer automotive and sensor board applications we may experience a decline in our overall gross margins from sales of these potentially high volume but low margin product lines 

our quarterly operating results are subject to fluctuations and seasonality 

our operating results are difficult to predict our future quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly if this occurs the price of our stock would likely decline as we expand our operations our operating expenses particularly our sales marketing and research and development costs may increase as a percentage of our sales if revenues decrease and we are unable to reduce those costs rapidly our operating results would be negatively affected 

historically our revenues have usually been weaker in the first and third quarters of each fiscal year and have from time to time been lower than the preceding quarter our devices are highly consumeroriented and consumer buying is traditionally lower in these quarters sales of certain of our consumer products tend to be higher in our second fiscal quarter due to increased consumer spending for such products during the recreational marine and fishing season sales of certain of our consumer products also tend to be higher in our fourth fiscal quarter due to increased consumer spending patterns on electronic devices during the holiday season in addition we attempt to time our new product releases to coincide with relatively higher consumer spending in the second and fourth fiscal quarters which contributes to these seasonal variations 

our quarterly financial statements will reflect fluctuations in foreign currency translation 

our taiwan subsidiary holds and is expected to continue to hold significant cash cash equivalents and marketable securities and receivables denominated in us dollars because the us dollar is the primary currency for our business and in order to substantially reduce the economic consequence of any variation in the exchange rate for the us dollar and the new taiwan dollar on these assets management expects that the taiwan subsidiary will continue to hold the majority of these assets in us dollar or us dollar denominated instruments nonetheless us gaap requires the company at the end of each accounting period to translate into new taiwan dollars all such us dollar denominated assets held by our taiwan subsidiary this translation is required because the new taiwan dollar is the functional currency of the subsidiary this us gaapmandated translation will cause us to recognize gain or loss on our financial statements as the new taiwan dollarus dollar exchange rate varies such gain or loss will create variations in our earnings per share because there is minimal cash impact caused by such exchange rate variations management will continue to focus on the company’s operating performance before the impact of the foreign currency translation 

if we are unable to compete effectively with existing or new competitors our resulting loss of competitive position could result in price reductions fewer customer orders reduced margins and loss of market share 

the markets for our products are highly competitive and we expect competition to increase in the future some of our competitors have significantly greater financial technical and marketing resources than we do these competitors may be able to respond more rapidly to new or emerging technologies or changes in customer requirements they may also be able to devote greater resources to the development promotion and sale of their products increased competition could result in price reductions fewer customer orders reduced margins and loss of market share our failure to compete successfully against current or future competitors could seriously harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

our intellectual property rights are important to our operations and we could suffer loss if they infringe upon other’s rights or are infringed upon by others 

we rely on a combination of patents copyrights trademarks and trade secrets confidentiality provisions and licensing arrangements to establish and protect our proprietary rights to this end we hold rights to a number of patents and registered trademarks and regularly file applications to attempt to protect our rights in new technology and trademarks however there is no guarantee that our patent applications will become issued patents or that our trademark applications will become registered trademarks moreover even if approved our patents or trademarks may thereafter be successfully challenged by others or otherwise become invalidated for a variety of reasons thus any patents or trademarks we currently have or may later acquire may not provide us a significant competitive advantage 

third parties may claim that we are infringing their intellectual property rights such claims could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition from time to time we receive letters alleging infringement of patents litigation concerning patents or other intellectual property is costly and time consuming we may seek licenses from such parties but they could refuse to grant us a license or demand commercially unreasonable terms we might not have sufficient resources to pay for the licenses such infringement claims could also cause us to incur substantial liabilities and to suspend or permanently cease the use of critical technologies or processes or the production or sale of major products 

failure to obtain required certifications of our products on a timely basis could harm our business 

we have certain products especially in our aviation segment that are subject to governmental and similar certifications before they can be sold for example federal aviation administration “faa” certification is required for all of our aviation products that are intended for installation in type certificated aircraft to the extent required certification is an expensive and timeconsuming process that requires significant focus and resources an inability to obtain or excessive delay in obtaining such certifications could have an adverse effect on our ability to introduce new products and therefore our operating results in addition we cannot assure you that our certified products will not be decertified any such decertification could have an adverse effect on our operating results 

we may be materially affected by the european rohs and weee directives the european union “eu” has enacted the restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment directive “rohs directive” and the waste electrical and electronic equipment directive “weee directive” the rohs directive requires eu member states to enact laws prohibiting the use of certain substances including lead mercury cadmium and chromium in certain electronic products put on the market after july 1 2006 the weee directive requires eu member states to enact laws that come into effect by august 13 2005 regulating the collection recovery and recycling of waste from certain electronic products we will need to ensure that we timely comply with such laws and regulations in order to comply with the rohs directive we will need to modify the design of certain of our products andor use different components in such products we could incur substantial costs in connection with our compliance with such environmental laws and regulations we could also be subject to governmental fines and liability to our customers if we were to fail to deliver products that comply with these laws which could cause our financial condition or operating results to suffer 

our business is subject to economic political and other risks associated with international sales and operations 

our business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally we estimate that approximately 35 of our net sales in the fiscal year ended december 25 2004 represented products shipped to international destinations accordingly our future results could be harmed by a variety of international factors including 

 • changes in foreign currency exchange rates 

 • changes in a specific countrys or regions political or economic conditions particularly in emerging markets 

 • trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements 

 • potentially negative consequences from changes in tax laws 

 • difficulty in managing widespread sales and manufacturing operations and 

 • less effective protection of intellectual property 

we may experience unique economic and political risks associated with companies that operate in taiwan 

relations between taiwan and the people’s republic of china also referred to as the prc and other factors affecting the political or economic conditions of taiwan in the future could affect our business and the market price and the liquidity of our shares our principal manufacturing facilities where we manufacture all of our products except our panelmounted aviation products are located in taiwan 

taiwan has a unique international political status the prc asserts sovereignty over all of china including taiwan certain other islands and all of mainland china the prc government does not recognize the legitimacy of the taiwan government although significant economic and cultural relations have been established during recent years between taiwan and the prc the prc government has indicated that it may use military force to gain control over taiwan in certain circumstances such as the declaration of independence by taiwan relations between taiwan and the prc have on occasion adversely affected the market value of taiwanese companies and could negatively affect our operations in taiwan in the future 

there is uncertainty as to our shareholders’ ability to enforce certain foreign civil liabilities in the cayman islands and taiwan 

we are a cayman islands company and a substantial portion of our assets are located outside the united states particularly in taiwan as a result it may be difficult to effect service of process within the united states upon us in addition there is uncertainty as to whether the courts of the cayman islands or taiwan would recognize or enforce judgments of united states courts obtained against us predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the united states or any state thereof or be competent to hear original actions brought in the cayman islands or taiwan against us predicated upon the securities laws of the united states or any state thereof 

our shareholders may face difficulties in protecting their interests because we are incorporated under cayman islands law 

our corporate affairs are governed by our memorandum and articles of association as amended and by the companies law 2004 revision and the common law of the cayman islands the rights of our shareholders and the fiduciary responsibilities of our directors under cayman islands law are not as clearly established as under statutes or judicial precedent in existence in jurisdictions in the united states therefore you may have more difficulty in protecting your interests in the face of actions by the management directors or our controlling shareholders than would shareholders of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction in the united states due to the comparatively less developed nature of cayman islands law in this area 

unlike many jurisdictions in the united states cayman islands law does not specifically provide for shareholder appraisal rights on a merger or consolidation of a company this may make it more difficult for you to assess the value of any consideration you may receive in a merger or consolidation or to require that the offeror give you additional consideration if you believe the consideration offered is insufficient 

shareholders of cayman islands exempted companies such as ourselves have no general rights under cayman islands law to inspect corporate records and accounts or to obtain copies of lists of shareholders of the company this may make it more difficult for you to obtain the information needed to establish any facts necessary for a shareholder motion or to solicit proxies from other shareholders in connection with a proxy contest 

subject to limited exceptions under cayman islands law a minority shareholder may not bring a derivative action against the board of directors our cayman islands counsel is not aware of any reported class action or derivative action having been brought in a cayman islands court 

enforcement of civil liabilities holders of our common shares may have difficulty obtaining or enforcing a judgment against us because we are incorporated under the laws of the cayman islands 

there is uncertainty as to whether the grand court of the cayman islands would recognize or enforce judgments of united states courts obtained against us predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the united states or any state thereof or be competent to hear original actions brought in the cayman islands against us predicated upon the securities laws of the united states or any state thereof 

we may pursue strategic acquisitions investments strategic partnerships or other ventures and our business could be materially harmed if we fail to successfully identify complete and integrate such transactions 

we intend to evaluate acquisition opportunities and opportunities to make investments in complementary businesses technologies services or products or to enter into any strategic partnerships with parties who can provide access to those assets additional product or services offerings or additional industry expertise in august 2003 we acquired ups aviation technologies inc we currently have no commitments to make any material investments or acquisitions or to enter into strategic partnerships we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition investment or strategic partnership candidates or if we do identify suitable candidates in the future we may not be able to complete those transactions on commercially favorable terms or at all 

any future acquisition could result in difficulties assimilating acquired operations and products and diversion of capital and management’s attention away from other business issues and opportunities integration of acquired companies may result in problems related to integration of technology and inexperienced management teams in addition the key personnel of the acquired company may decide not to work for us our management has had limited experience in assimilating acquired organizations and products into our operations we may not successfully integrate any operations personnel or products that we may acquire in the future if we fail to successfully integrate such transactions our business could be materially harmed 

we have benefited in the past from taiwan government tax incentives offered on certain high technology capital investments that may not always be available 

our effective tax rate is lower than the us federal statutory rate because we have benefited from lower tax rates since our inception and from incentives offered in taiwan related to our high technology investments in taiwan the loss of these tax benefits could have a significant effect on our financial results in the future 

changes in our united states federal income tax classification or in applicable tax law could result in adverse tax consequences to our shareholders 

we do not believe that we or any of our nonunited states subsidiaries are currently a “foreign personal holding company” or “passive foreign investment company” for united states federal income tax purposes we would constitute a foreign personal holding company in any taxable year if 1 60 or 50 in any year following the year in which we first became a foreign personal holding company or more of our gross income were foreign personal holding company income which is generally income of a passive nature such as dividends interest and royalties the “income test” and 2 more than 50 of the voting power or value of our equity were owned directly or indirectly by five or fewer us holders that are individuals the “shareholder test” 

we do not expect to become a passive foreign investment company however because the passive foreign investment company determination is made annually on the basis of facts and circumstances that may be beyond our control and because the principles for applying the passive foreign investment company tests are not entirely clear we cannot assure that we will not become a passive foreign investment company if we are a passive foreign investment company in any year then any of our shareholders that is a united states person could be liable to pay tax at ordinary income tax rates plus an interest charge upon some distributions by us or when that shareholder sells our common shares at a gain further if we are classified as a passive foreign investment company in any year in which a united states person is a shareholder we generally will continue to be treated as a passive foreign investment company with respect to such shareholder in all succeeding years regardless of whether we continue to satisfy the income or asset tests described above additional tax considerations would apply if we or any of our subsidiaries were a controlled foreign corporation 

if we or any of our nonunited states subsidiaries were classified as a foreign personal holding company for 2004 or any prior period then each shareholder that is a united states person would be required to pay tax on its pro rata share of the undistributed foreign personal holding income of such foreign personal holding company the foreign personal holding company rules have been repealed and should not apply to us after december 25 2004 

risks relating to our shares 

the volatility of our stock price could adversely affect investment in our common shares 

the market price of our common shares has been and may continue to be highly volatile during 2004 the closing price of our common shares ranged from a low of 2836 to a high of 6174 a variety of factors could cause the price of our common shares to fluctuate perhaps substantially including 

          41 

in addition in recent years the stock market in general and the markets for shares of technology companies in particular have experienced extreme price fluctuations which have often been unrelated to the operating performance of affected companies any such fluctuations in the future could adversely affect the market price of our common shares and the market price of our common shares may decline 

our officers and directors exert substantial influence over us as of march 1 2005 members and former members of our board of directors and our executive officers together with members of their families and entities that may be deemed affiliates of or related to such persons or entities beneficially own approximately 40 of our outstanding common shares accordingly these shareholders may be able to determine the outcome of corporate actions requiring shareholder approval such as mergers and acquisitions this level of ownership may have a significant effect in delaying deferring or preventing a change in control of garmin and may adversely affect the voting and other rights of other holders of our common shares 

prior to 2006 without the approval of a majority of certain of our shareholders we may not dispose of our shares of garmin corporation or its assets even if it would benefit all of our shareholders 

in connection with the reorganization whereby garmin became the holding company for garmin corporation shareholders of garmin corporation entered into a shareholders’ agreement whereby each shareholder party to the agreement agreed to take all reasonable actions required to prevent the disposition by garmin of any shares of garmin corporation or of substantially all of the assets of garmin corporation until after december 31 2005 except upon approval of a majority in interest of such shareholders who are us citizens or residents certain of our officers and directors own a substantial portion of these shares 

provisions in our charter documents might deter delay or prevent a third party from acquiring us and cayman islands corporate law may impede a takeover which could decrease the value of our shares 

our board of directors has the authority to issue up to 1000000 preferred shares and to determine the price rights preferences privileges and restrictions including voting rights of those shares without any further vote or action by the shareholders this could have an adverse impact on the market price of our common shares we have no present plans to issue any preferred shares but we may do so the rights of the holders of common shares may be subject to and adversely affected by the rights of the holders of any preferred shares that may be issued in the future in addition we have adopted a classified board of directors our shareholders are unable to remove any director or the entire board of directors without a super majority vote in addition a super majority vote is required to approve transactions with interested shareholders shareholders do not have the right to call a shareholders meeting we have adopted a shareholders’ rights plan which under certain circumstances would significantly impair the ability of third parties to acquire control of us without prior approval of our board of directors this shareholders’ rights plan and the provisions in our charter documents could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us even if doing so would benefit our shareholders 

unlike many jurisdictions in the united states cayman islands law does not provide for mergers as that expression is understood under corporate law in the united states while cayman islands law does have statutory provisions that provide for the reconstruction and amalgamation of companies which are commonly referred to in the cayman islands as a “scheme of arrangement” the procedural and legal requirements necessary to consummate these transactions are more rigorous and take longer to complete than the procedures typically required to consummate a merger in the united states under cayman islands law and practice a scheme of arrangement in relation to a solvent cayman islands exempted company must be approved at a shareholders’ meeting by a majority of the company’s shareholders who are present and voting either in person or by proxy at such meeting the shares voted in favor of the scheme of arrangement must also represent at least 75 of the value of each class of the company’s shareholders excluding the shares owned by the parties to the scheme of arrangement present and voting at the meeting the grand court of the cayman islands must also sanction the convening of these meetings and the terms of the amalgamation although there is no requirement to seek the consent of the creditors of the parties involved in the scheme of arrangement the grand court typically seeks to ensure that the creditors have consented to the transfer of their liabilities to the surviving entity or that the scheme of arrangement does not otherwise materially adversely affect the creditors’ interests furthermore the grand court will only approve a scheme of arrangement if it is satisfied that 

    item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market sensitivity we have market risk primarily in connection with the pricing of our products and services and the purchase of raw materials product pricing and raw materials costs are both significantly influenced by semiconductor market conditions historically during cyclical industry downturns we have been able to offset pricing declines for our products through a combination of improved product mix and success in obtaining price reductions in raw materials costs 

inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our business financial condition or results of operations if our costs were to become subject to significant inflationary pressures we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs through price increases our inability or failure to do so could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

foreign currency exchange rate risk the operation of the company’s subsidiaries in international markets results in exposure to movements in currency exchange rates we generally have not been significantly affected by foreign exchange fluctuations because until recently the new taiwan dollar has proven to be relatively stable however periodically we have experienced significant foreign currency gains and losses due to the strengthening and weakening of the us dollar the potential of volatile foreign exchange rate fluctuations in the future could have a significant effect on our results of operations 

the principal currency involved is the new taiwan dollar garmin corporation located in shijr taiwan uses the local currency as the functional currency the company translates all assets and liabilities at yearend exchange rates and income and expense accounts at average rates during the year in order to minimize the effect of the currency exchange fluctuations on our net assets we have elected to retain most of our taiwan subsidiary’s cash and investments marketable securities in us dollars as discussed above the new taiwan dollarus dollar exchange rate can be volatile the exchange rate decreased 55 during 2004 and resulted in a foreign currency loss of 248 million the exchange rate decreased 30 during 2003 and resulted in a foreign currency loss of 67 million while the net effect of foreign currency moves in fiscal 2002 was neutral there were significant shifts in the exchange rate throughout 2002 a 10 positive or negative change in the us dollar exchange rate versus the new taiwan dollar would have resulted in a foreign currency gain of 472 million positive 10 change or a foreign currency loss of 472 million negative 10 change during 2004 the majority of our worldwide sales are transacted in us dollars therefore the impact on sales related to foreign currency movements is minimal 

interest rate risk we have no outstanding longterm debt and therefore no debtrelated interest rate risk 

we are exposed to interest rate risk in connection with our investments in marketable securities as interest rates change the unrealized gains and losses associated with those securities will fluctuate accordingly a hypothetical change of 10 in interest rates would not have a material effect on such unrealized gains or losses at december 25 2004 unrealized losses on those securities were 19 million 







 item 9 changes in and disagreements with accountants on accounting and financial disclosure none 

item 9a controls and procedures   a conclusion regarding the effectiveness of disclosure controls and procedures 

under the supervision and with the participation of our management including the chief executive officer and chief financial officer we have evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to exchange act rule 13a15c as of the end of the period covered by this report based on the evaluation the chief executive officer and chief financial officer have concluded that these disclosure controls and procedures are effective 

  b managements report on internal control over financial reporting 

management of the company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting the company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

management of the company assessed the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of december 25 2004 in making this assessment management used the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso in “internal controlintegrated framework” 

based on such assessment and those criteria management believes that the company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 25 2004 

ernst  young llp the independent registered public accounting firm that audited the company’s consolidated financial statements issued an attestation report on management’s assessment of the company’s internal control over financial reporting that attestation report appears below 

  c attestation report of the independent registered public accounting   firm 

report of independent registered public accounting firm on internal control over financial reporting the board of directors and shareholders garmin ltd 

we have audited management’s assessment included in the accompanying management’s report on internal control over financial reporting that garmin ltd and subsidiaries maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 25 2004 based on criteria established in internal control—integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission the coso criteria garmin ltd and subsidiaries’ management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting our responsibility is to express an opinion on management’s assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit 

we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting evaluating management’s assessment testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion 

a company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

in our opinion management’s assessment that garmin ltd and subsidiaries maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 25 2004 is fairly stated in all material respects based on the coso criteria also in our opinion garmin ltd and subsidiaries maintained in all material respects effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 25 2004 based on the coso criteria  

we also have audited in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states the consolidated balance sheets of garmin ltd and subsidiaries as of december 25 2004 and december 27 2003 and the related consolidated statements of income shareholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended december 25 2004 of garmin ltd and subsidiaries and our report dated march 7 2005 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon

company overview

     garmin is a leading  worldwide provider of navigation  communications and
information  devices  most of  which  are  enabled  by gps  technology  garmin
designs  develops  manufactures  and markets  under the garmin brand a diverse
family of  handheld  portable and fixed mount  gpsenabled  products and other
navigation communications and information products for the general aviation and
consumer  markets  each of  garmins  gps  products  utilizes  its  proprietary
integrated  circuit  and  receiver  designs to  collect  calculate  and display
location direction speed and other information in forms optimized for specific
uses



overview of the global positioning system

     the  global  positioning  system is a  worldwide  navigation  system  which
enables the precise  determination  of  geographic  location  using  established
satellite  technology  the  system  consists  of a  constellation  of  orbiting
satellites  the satellites and their ground control and monitoring stations are
maintained  and  operated by the united  states  department  of  defense  which
maintains an ongoing satellite replenishment program to ensure continuous global
system  coverage  access to the system is  provided  free of charge by the us
government

                                       2

     reception  of  gps  signals  from  the  satellites  requires  lineofsight
visibility between the satellites and the receiver  gps receivers  generally do
not work  indoors  and when a receiver is  outside  buildings  hills and dense
foliage can attenuate or block reception gps receivers can be very compact and
it is not necessary to have a large dish antenna to receive gps signals

     prior to may 2000 the us  department of defense  intentionally  degraded
the  accuracy  of  civilian  gps  signals  in  a  process   known  as  selective
availability  sa for national  security  purposes  sa variably degraded gps
position accuracy to a radius of 100 meters on may 2 2000 the us department
of defense  discontinued  sa with sa removed  a gps receiver can calculate its
position  to an  accuracy  of  approximately  10 meters or less  enhancing  the
utility of gps for most applications

     the  accuracy  and  utility of gps can be  enhanced  even  further  through
augmentation  techniques  which compute any  remaining  errors in the signal and
broadcast these corrections to a gps device the federal aviation administration
faa is developing a wide area augmentation system waas comprising ground
reference stations and additional  satellites which will improve the accuracy of
gps positioning available in the united states and portions of canada and mexico
to  approximately  3 meters  waas is  intended to support the use of gps as the
primary means of enroute  terminal and approach  navigation for aviation in the
united  states  the  increased  accuracy  offered by waas is  expected  also to
enhance the utility of waasenabled gps receivers for consumer applications the
faa  announced  on july 11  2003  that the waas  system  had  achieved  initial
operating capability and that the system was available for instrument flight use
with appropriately certified avionics equipment

research and development

     garmins product  innovations are driven by its strong emphasis on research
and  development  and the close  partnership  between  garmins  engineering and
manufacturing teams garmins products are created by its engineering and design
staff  which  numbered  approximately  515 people  worldwide as of december 31
2003 garmins  manufacturing staff includes manufacturing process engineers who
work closely with  garmins  design  engineers to ensure  manufacturability  and
manufacturing  cost control for its  products  garmins  design staff  includes
industrial  designers  as well as software engineers  electrical engineers and
mechanical engineers  garmin believes the industrial design of its products has
played an important  role in garmins  success  once a  development  project is
initiated  and  approved  a  multidisciplinary  team is  created to design the
product and transition it into manufacturing

     below is a table of garmins  expenditures on research and development over
the last three fiscal years





                                                                fiscal years ended

manufacturing and operations

     garmin  believes  that one of its core  competencies  is its  manufacturing
capability at both its shijr  taiwan facility and its olathe  kansas facility
garmin  believes  that its  vertically  integrated  approach has provided it the
following benefits

     reduced   timetomarket   utilizing  concurrent  engineering  techniques
garmins products are introduced to production at an early development stage and
the feedback  provided by manufacturing  is incorporated  into the design before
mass  production  begins  in this  manner  garmin  attempts to reduce the time
required to move a product from its design phase to mass production  deliveries
with improved quality and yields  reducing time to market has enabled garmin to
offer  several  industry  firsts  such as the  rino  gpsenabled  family  radio
servicegeneral  mobile radio  service  twoway  radio  the ique 3600  portable
digital  assistant  with  integrated  gps and  mapping  and the gns  430  which
integrates  traditional aviation navigation and communications  systems with gps
in a single package

     design and process optimization garmin uses its manufacturing resources to
rapidly  prototype design  concepts  products and processes in order to achieve
higher efficiency  lower cost and better value for customers  garmins ability
to fully explore product design and  manufacturing  process concepts has enabled
it to optimize  its designs to minimize  size and weight in gps devices that are
functional waterproof and rugged

     logistical agility operating its own manufacturing facilities helps garmin
minimize  problems  such as component  shortages and long  component lead times
which are common in the electronics industry many products can be reengineered
to bypass  component  shortages  or reduce  cost and the new designs can quickly
fill the  distribution  pipeline  garmin  reacts  rapidly  to changes in market
demand by maintaining a safety stock of longlead components and by rescheduling
components from one product line to another

     garmins design and manufacturing processes are certified to iso 90012000
international quality standards developed by the international  organization for
standardization  garmins  taiwan  manufacturing  facility has also achieved qs
9000 quality  certification  a quality  standard for automotive  suppliers  in
addition  garmins aviation  panelmount  products are designed and manufactured
according to processes which are approved and monitored by the faa

materials

     garmin  purchases  components  for its products  from a number of suppliers
around  the  world  for  certain  components  garmin  relies  on  sole  source
suppliers  the failure of our  suppliers to deliver  components  in  sufficient
quantities and in a timely manner could adversely affect our business

seasonality

     our sales are subject to some seasonal fluctuation typically sales of our
consumer  products are highest in the second  quarter  due to increased  demand
during the spring and summer marine season  and in the fourth  quarter  due to
increased  demand during the holiday buying season  sales of consumer  products
are also  influenced by the timing of the release of new products  our aviation
products do not experience much seasonal  variation  but are more influenced by
the timing of the release of new products  when the initial  demand is typically
the strongest

backlog

     our sales are  generally  of a consumer  nature  and there is a  relatively
short cycle  between  order and  shipment  therefore  we believe  that backlog
information is not material to the  understanding of our business  we typically
ship most orders within 72 hours of receipt


intellectual property

     garmins  success  and  ability  to  compete  is  dependent  in part on its
proprietary  technology  garmin relies on a combination  of patent  copyright
trademark  and trade  secret laws  as well as  confidentiality  agreements  to
establish and protect our proprietary  rights  as of march 1 2004 garmin held
141 us  patents that expire at various dates no earlier than 2006 as of march
1 2004 garmin had 153 us patent  applications  pending  our us patents do
not create any patent rights in foreign countries and we do not hold any foreign
patents in addition  garmin often relies on licenses of intellectual  property
for use in its  business  for  example  garmin  obtains  licenses  for digital
cartography  technology for use in our products from various  sources  garmins
registered us  trademarks  include  garmin the garmin logo the garmin globe
design the garmin swoosh design apollo  bluechart city select dcg etrex
etrex camo etrex legend etrex summit etrex vista etrex venture gnc gps ii
gps iii  gps v  gpsmap  guidance  by  garmin  ique  mapsource  metroguide
navtalk personal navigator rino seethru  streetpilot and tracback our mark
garmin and  certain  other  trademarks  have also been  registered  in  selected
foreign countries  garmins  trademarks include  forerunner  foretrex  g1000
geko  ion que and waas enabled  some of garmins  patents and its  registered
trademarks   and  trademarks   are  owned  by  garmins   subsidiaries   garmin
corporation garmin international inc and garmin at inc

     garmin  believes that its  continued  success  depends on the  intellectual
skills of its employees  and their ability to continue to innovate  garmin will
continue to file and prosecute patent  applications  when appropriate to attempt
to protect garmins rights in its proprietary technologies

     it is possible that garmins current patents or patents which it may later
acquire  may be successfully  challenged or invalidated in whole or in part it
is also  possible that garmin may not obtain  issued  patents for  inventions it
seeks to protect  it is also possible  that garmin may not develop  proprietary
products or technologies  in the future that are patentable  or that any patent
issued to garmin may not provide it with any competitive advantages or that the
patents of others will preclude garmin from  manufacturing and marketing certain
products   legal  protections  afford  only  limited  protection  for  garmins
technology   despite  garmins  efforts  to  protect  its  proprietary  rights
unauthorized  parties  may attempt to copy  aspects of  garmins  products or to
obtain and use information that garmin regards as proprietary litigation may be

                                       10
page

necessary in the future to enforce garmins  intellectual  property  rights  to
protect  its  trade  secrets  to  determine  the  validity  and  scope  of  the
proprietary  rights of others or to defend  against  claims of  infringement  or
invalidity  any  resulting  litigation  could result in  substantial  costs and
diversion of garmins  resources  garmins means of protecting its  proprietary
rights may not be adequate and garmins  competitors may  independently  develop
similar technology


regulations

     garmins  aviation  products  that are  intended for  installation  in type
certificated  aircraft  are  required to be  certified  by the faa its european
counterpart  the joint aviation authorities and other comparable organizations
before  they can be used in an  aircraft  the  telecommunications  industry  is
highly  regulated  and the regulatory  environment in which garmin  operates is
subject to change in accordance with federal  communication  commission fcc
rules and  regulations  wireless  transceiver and cellular handset products are
required  to be  certified  by the fcc and  comparable  authorities  in  foreign
countries where they are sold  garmins products sold in europe are required to
comply with relevant directives of the european commission a delay in receiving
required certifications for new products or enhancements to garmins products or
losing  certification  for garmins existing products could adversely affect its
business

     because garmin corporation one of the companys principal subsidiaries is
located in taiwan  foreign exchange control laws and regulations of taiwan with
respect to  remittances  into and out of taiwan  may have an impact on  garmins
operations  the  taiwan  foreign  exchange  control  statute  and  regulations
thereunder  provide that all foreign exchange  transactions must be executed by
banks  designated  to handle such  business by the ministry of finance of taiwan
and by the  central  bank  of  china  also  referred  to as  the  cbc  current
regulations favor  traderelated  foreign exchange  transactions  consequently
foreign  currency  earned from  exports of  merchandise  and services may now be
retained and used freely by exporters while all foreign currency needed for the
import of merchandise  and services may be purchased  freely from the designated
foreign exchange banks aside from traderelated foreign exchange  transactions
taiwan  companies and residents may without foreign  exchange  approval  remit
outside and into taiwan  foreign  currencies of up to 50 million and 5 million
respectively  or their  equivalent  each calendar year  currency  conversions
within the limits are  processed by the  designated  banks and do not have to be
reviewed  and  approved  by the cbc  the  above  limits  apply  to  remittances
involving  a  conversion  between new taiwan  dollars and us  dollars or other
foreign currencies the cbc typically approves foreign exchange in excess of the
limits  if a party  applies  with the cbc for  review  and  presents  legitimate
business  reasons  justifying  the currency  conversion  a requirement  is also
imposed on all  enterprises  to register all medium and  longterm  foreign debt
with the cbc


environmental matters

     capital expenditures  earnings and the competitive position of garmin have

overview

     we are a leading  worldwide  provider  of  navigation  communications  and
information devices  most of which are enabled by global positioning system or
gps technology  we operate in two business segments the consumer and aviation
markets  both of our segments offer products through our network of independent
dealers and distributors however the nature of products and types of customers
for the two  segments  vary  significantly  as such  the  segments are managed
separately our consumer segment includes portable gps receivers and accessories
for marine  recreation  land and  automotive  applications  sold  primarily to
retail outlets  our aviation products are portable and panelmount avionics for
visual  flight  rules  and  instrument  flight  rules  navigation  and are  sold
primarily to retail outlets and certain aircraft manufacturers

     since our first products were delivered in 1991 we have generated positive
income from  operations each year and have funded our growth from these profits
our sales have  increased at a compounded  annual  growth rate of 23 since 1996
and our net income has increased at a compounded annual growth rate of 34 since
1996  the vast  majority  of this  growth has been  organic  only a very small
amount of new revenue  occurred as a result of the  acquisition  of ups aviation
technologies  in 2003 and this  acquisition  had no  significant  impact on net
income for that year

     since our  principal  locations  are in the united  states  taiwan and the
uk we experience some foreign currency fluctuations in our operating results
the functional currency of our european operations is the us dollar effective
in 2001 and the functional  currency of our asian  operations is the new taiwan
dollar  minimal  transactions of our european operations are now denominated in
british  pounds  sterling  or the euro  we  experienced  67  million  00
million  116 million  70 million  and 15 million in foreign  currency
gains  losses  during  fiscal  years  2003   2002   2001  2000  and  1999
respectively  to date we have not entered into hedging  transactions  with the
european dollar  the british pound sterling or the new taiwan dollar  although
we may utilize hedging transactions in the future

critical accounting policies and estimates


general

     the  companys  discussion  and  analysis of its  financial  condition  and
results  of  operations  are based  upon the  companys  consolidated  financial
statements  which have been prepared in accordance with  accounting  principles
generally  accepted in the united states  the  presentation  of these financial
statements requires the company to make estimates and judgements that affect the
reported  amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and  expenses  and related
disclosure of  contingent  assets and  liabilities  on an ongoing  basis  the
company  evaluates its  estimates  including  those  related to customer  sales
programs and incentives  product returns bad debts inventories  investments
intangible assets  income taxes  warranty  obligations  and contingencies and
litigation  the company  bases its estimates on  historical  experience  and on
various  other  assumptions  that  are  believed  to  be  reasonable  under  the
circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making  judgements about
the carrying value of assets and liabilities  that are not readily apparent from
other sources  actual results may differ from these  estimates  under different
assumptions or conditions


revenue recognition

     the company  records  estimated  reductions  to revenue for customer  sales
programs returns and incentive  offerings  including rebates  price protection
promotions  and other  volumebased  incentives  the  reductions to revenue are
based on estimates and judgements using historical experience and expectation of
future  conditions  changes  in these  estimates  could  negatively  affect the
companys operating results these incentives are accrued for on a percentage of
sales basis and reviewed periodically if market conditions were to decline the
company  may take  actions to increase  customer  incentive  offerings  possibly
resulting in an  incremental  reduction of revenue at the time the  incentive is
offered


warranties

     the companys products sold are generally covered by a warranty for periods
ranging  from one to two  years  the  company  accrues a warranty  reserve  for
estimated costs to provide warranty services the companys estimate of costs to
service  its  warranty  obligations  is  based  on  historical   experience  and
expectation  of  future  conditions  to  the  extent  the  company  experiences
increased  warranty claim activity or increased costs  associated with servicing
those claims  its warranty  accrual will increase  resulting in decreased gross
profit


inventory

     the  company  writes  down its  inventory  for  estimated  obsolescence  or
unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and
the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market
conditions  if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected
by management additional inventory writedowns may be required

investments

     investments  are  classified  as  available  for sale and  recorded at fair
value and unrealized investment gains and losses are reflected in stockholders
equity  investment income is recorded when earned and capital gains and losses
are recognized when investments are sold  investments are reviewed periodically
to determine if they have  suffered an  impairment  of value that is  considered
other than temporary  if investments  are determined to be impaired  a capital
loss is recognized at the date of determination

     testing for impairment of investments also requires significant  management
judgement   the  identification  of  potentially  impaired   investments   the
determination  of their fair value and the  assessment of whether any decline in
value is other than temporary are the key judgement  elements  the discovery of
new  information  and  the  passage  of  time  can  significantly  change  these
judgements  revisions of impairment  judgements  are made when new  information

                                       17
page

becomes known and any resulting  impairment  adjustments are made at that time
the current  economic  environment and recent  volatility of securities  markets
increase the  difficulty  of  determining  fair value and  assessing  investment
impairment


income taxes

     while no valuation allowance has been recorded  it is the companys policy
to record a valuation  allowance  to reduce its deferred tax assets to an amount
that it believes is more likely than not to be  realized  while the company has
considered  future taxable income and ongoing  prudent and feasible tax planning
strategies in assessing the need for the valuation  allowance  in the event the
company  were to  determine  that it would not be able to realize all or part of
its net deferred  tax assets in the future  an  adjustment  to the deferred tax
assets  would be charged to income in the period  such  determination  was made
likewise  should the  company  determine  that it would be able to realize  its
deferred  tax  assets in the  future in excess of its net  recorded  amount  an
adjustment to the deferred tax assets would  increase  income in the period such
determination was made

     in addition  the calculation of our tax liabilities  involves dealing with
uncertainties  in the  application  of complex  tax  regulations  we  recognize
liabilities for tax audit issues in the us and other tax  jurisdictions  based
on our estimate of whether  and the extent to which  additional  taxes will be
due  if payment  of these  amounts  ultimately  proves to be  unnecessary  the
reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the
period  when we  determine  the  liabilities  are no  longer  necessary  if our
estimate of tax liabilities  proves to be less than the ultimate  assessment  a
further charge to expense would result

stock based compensation

     the company  distributes  a small number of stock options each year as part
of the companys  compensation  package for  employees  employees  with certain
levels of  responsibility  within the  company  are  eligible  for stock  option
grants  but the granting of options is at the  discretion  of the  compensation
committee of the board of directors and is not a contractual  obligation  stock
compensation  plans  are  discussed  in  detail  in  note  11 of  the  notes  to
consolidated financial statements


accounting terms and characteristics


net sales

     our net sales are  primarily  generated  through sales to our global dealer
and distributor  network and to original equipment  manufacturers  we recognize
sales when  products  are shipped  our sales are largely of a consumer  nature
therefore  backlog  levels are not  necessarily  indicative  of our future sales
results  we aim to  achieve a quick  turnaround  on orders we  receive  and we
typically ship most orders within 72 hours

     net sales are subject to some seasonal fluctuation typically sales of our
consumer  products are highest in the second  quarter  due to increased  demand
during the spring and summer marine season  and in the fourth  quarter  due to
increased demand during the holiday buying season  our aviation products do not
experience much seasonal variation but are more influenced by the timing of the
release of new products when the initial demand is typically the strongest


gross profit

     the  most  significant  components  of our  cost  of  goods  sold  are  raw
materials  labor  and  depreciation  raw  material  costs  which are our most
significant  cost item  have come down  slightly  as a  percentage  of sales in
recent  years  as we have  negotiated  lower raw  material  costs  with our key
suppliers  as a result  gross profit has improved  somewhat as a percentage of
sales when compared with prior years


                                       18
page

     in 2000 we  experienced  upward pricing  pressures on our high  technology
components  but  had  offset  those  with  efficiencies  in  our  manufacturing
processes we did not experience significant pricing pressure on high technology
components  in fiscal  2001 and  fiscal  2002  we  experienced  upward  pricing
pressures on our high  technology  components  in late 2003  but offset much of
those with efficiencies in our manufacturing processes our existing practice of
performing the design and manufacture of our products inhouse has enabled us to
utilize  alternative  lower cost components from different  suppliers and where
possible  to  redesign  our  products  to  permit us to use  these  lower  cost
components  we believe that because of our practice of  performing  the design
manufacture and marketing of our products inhouse  both our shijr  taiwan and
olathe  kansas  manufacturing  plants have experienced  relatively low costs of
manufacturing compared to our competition in general products manufactured in
taiwan have been our highest  volume  products  our  manufacturing  labor costs
historically have been lower in taiwan than in olathe

     sales  price  variability  has had and can be expected to have an effect on
our gross profit  in the past prices of some of our handheld devices sold into
the consumer  market have declined due to market  pressures and  introduction of
new  products  sold at lower price  points  the average  selling  prices of our
aviation  products  have  decreased  due to  product  mix and  market  pressures
partially  offset by the  introduction of more advanced  products sold at higher
prices  in  conjunction  with the effects of lower labor costs  experienced  on
taiwan production the effect of the sales price variability inherent within the
mix of  gpsenabled  products sold could have a significant  impact on our gross
profit


selling general and administrative expenses

         our selling general and administrative expenses consist primarily of

         o    salaries for sales and marketing personnel

         o    salaries and related costs for executives and administrative
              personnel

         o    advertising marketing and other brand building costs

         o    accounting and legal costs

         o    information systems and infrastructure costs

         o    travel and related costs and

         o    occupancy and other overhead costs

     since we plan to  increase  market  penetration  in the  future  we expect
selling  general and  administrative  expenses to continue to increase  for the
foreseeable future we intend to increase  advertising and marketing expenses in
order to build increased brand awareness in the consumer marketplace especially
as we continue to develop new markets  such as automotive and personal  digital
assistants pda we also intend to increase our customer call center support as
our consumer  segment  continues to grow  another  cause of increased  selling
general and administrative  costs is the continued  implementation of an oracle
enterprise  resource  planning  erp system during  fiscal 2004 and  associated
information  system staffing needed to support oracle  we anticipate that these
increased  expenses  could  impact  our  financial  results  in fiscal  2004 and
subsequent periods although it is unclear at this point what the extent of this
impact may be

research and development

     the majority of our research and development  costs represent  salaries for
our  engineers  costs  for  high  technology  components  used in  product  and
prototype  development  and  costs  of test  equipment  needed  during  product
development

     we have continued to grow our research and development  capabilities  since
our inception substantially all of the research and development of our products
is performed in the united states

                                       19
page

     we  are  committed  to  increasing  the  level  of  innovative  design  and
development  of new  products  as we strive  for  expanded  ability to serve our
existing  consumer and aviation  markets as well as new markets for  gpsenabled
devices  we continue to grow our  research and  development  budget on absolute
terms  research  and  development  expenses may also grow at a faster rate when
compared to our projected revenue growth for fiscal year 2003


customers

     no customer  accounted  for greater than 10 of our sales in the year ended
december 27 2003 our top ten customers  accounted for approximately 25 of net
sales  we  have  experienced  average  sales  days  in  our  customer  accounts
receivable  between 35 and 51 days since  1999  the  average  sales days in our
customer accounts receivable was 51 days as of december 27 2004


income taxes

     we have  experienced  a relatively  low effective tax rate in taiwan due to
lower marginal tax rates and substantial tax incentives offered by the taiwanese
government on certain  hightechnology capital investments  therefore  profits
earned in taiwan have been taxed at a lower rate than those in the united states
and europe as a result  our consolidated  effective tax rate was approximately
21 during 2003 we have taken advantage of this tax benefit in taiwan since our
inception and we expect to continue to benefit from lower effective tax rates at
least  through  2008  the current  taiwan tax  incentives  for which garmin has
received  approval  will  end in  2008  we  plan  on  applying  for  additional
incentives for years beyond 2008 based on capital  investments we expect to make
in the future  however there can be no assurance that such tax incentives will
be available indefinitely

     the increase in total net sales during fiscal 2003 was primarily due to the
introduction  of 16 new products and overall  demand for our consumer  products
total consumer and aviation units sold increased 330 to 2066000 in 2003 from
1557000 in 2002 in general  management  believes that continuous  innovation
and the introduction of new products are essential for future revenue growth

     the  companys  revenues are  seasonal  with the fiscal  second and fourth
quarter revenues  meaningfully  higher than the first and third fiscal quarters
the revenue increase in second quarter is primarily attributable to the onset of
the marine  selling  season and  secondarily  fathers  day  purchases  and the
revenue  increase  in  the  fourth  quarter  is  primarily  attributable  to the
traditional  holiday selling season  revenues can also be impacted in any given
quarter by the timing of new product introductions

     the  increase  in  net  sales  to  consumers   was  primarily  due  to  the
introduction  of 16 new consumer  products  and overall  demand for our consumer
products  as total units sold were up 33  it is  managements  belief that the
continued demand for the companys  consumer products is due to the emergence of
the gps market in  general  and overall  increased  consumer  awareness  of the
capabilities and applications of gps

     the  increase  in  aviation  sales for  fiscal  2003 was  primarily  due to
increased  sales from panel mount  products  sold into the  retrofit  market and
sales from ups aviation  technologies now garmin at inc  which was acquired
during the third quarter of 2003  while temporary flight  restrictions  tfrs
continue to impact general  aviation  the flying community is adapting to these
changes  and  returning  to the skies in greater  numbers  should  the  federal
aviation  administration  faa impose more  restrictions  or elect to shutdown
us airspace in the future  these factors could have a material adverse effect
on our business

gross profit

     the increase in gross profit is primarily attributed to the introduction of
16 new products and overall demand for our consumer products the improvement in
gross  margin  was  primarily  due to the  introduction  of  new  higher  margin
products  improved  manufacturing  efficiencies  on many  of the  new  products
introduced  throughout the year and reductions of certain  material costs early
in the fiscal year the company  experienced  upward pricing pressure on certain
raw materials components in the latter part of 2003 it is unclear at this point
if this pricing pressure will abate or continue in 2004

     the  increase in  consumer  gross  margin is  primarily  attributed  to the
introduction  of 16 new consumer  products  and overall  demand for our consumer
products

     the increase in aviation gross profit is primarily due to improved  product
mix within our oem and retrofit products partially offset by certain lower gross
profit  margin  products  as  a  result  of  the  acquisition  of  ups  aviation
technologies


selling general and administrative expenses




                      
                                     2003                                2002                        year over year

     the  increase  in  expense  was  primarily  attributable  to  increases  in
employment  generally across the organization net increase of approximately 300
nonengineering  employees  significantly increased advertising costs up 32
associated  primarily with consumer  products  oracle  software  implementation
costs  and  additional  staffing  in our  customer  call  center  in the past
selling  general and  administrative  expenses  increased  at a lower rate than
revenues  due to  strong  demand  for newly  introduced  and  existing  consumer
products  management  expects that in spite of strong  demand for our products
selling  general  and  administrative  expenses  will  remain  flat or increase
slightly as a percentage of sales during fiscal 2004


research and development expenses

     the increase in research and development expense was primarily attributable
to the addition of 50 ups aviation  technologies  engineering  associates to our
aviation  research and development team and the addition of 100 new engineers to
our research and development teams during fiscal 2003  management believes that
one of the key  strategic  initiatives  for  future  growth  and  success of the
company is continuous innovation development and introduction of new products

                                       22

management  expects that its research and  development  expenses  will  increase
approximately  20 to 25 during fiscal 2004 on an absolute  dollar basis due to
the anticipated  introduction of  approximately 45 new products for fiscal 2004
management  expects to continue to invest in the research and development of new
products and technology in order to maintain the companys competitive advantage
in the markets in which it competes


other income expense

     other income expense  principally  consists of interest income  interest
expense  and  foreign  currency  exchange  gains and  losses  other  income was
significantly  lower in fiscal  2003  relative  to fiscal  year 2002  with the
majority of this difference caused by foreign currency losses in 2003  interest
income for fiscal 2003  increased due to larger cash and  marketable  securities
balances during the year  increasing the returns on the companys cash and cash
equivalents  interest expense  decreased 60 for fiscal 2003 relative to fiscal
2002 due primarily to the  retirement of 20 million of  outstanding  longterm
debt during fiscal 2003

     during fiscal 2003 the company experienced foreign currency exchange losses
of 67 million as the us dollar weakened versus the new taiwan dollar 3405
ntdusd relative to the end of fiscal 2002 3490 ntdusd  during fiscal 2002
the  companys  position  was neutral with regard to foreign  currency  exchange
gains and losses and the us dollar was at approximately the same level at the
beginning of 2002 relative to the new taiwan dollar  3517  ntdusd as it was
at the end of fiscal 2002 3490 ntdusd


income tax provision

     income tax expense increased by 74 million to 473 million  for fiscal
year 2003 from  399  million  for fiscal  year 2002 due to our higher  taxable
income the effective tax rate was 209 for fiscal 2003 versus 219 for fiscal
2002  the  decrease in tax rate is due  primarily  to  additional  tax benefits
received  from taiwan as a result of our  continued  capital  investment  in our
manufacturing  facilities there management believes that the effective tax rate
for fiscal 2004 will be comparable to fiscal 2003 the actual effective tax rate
will be dependent upon the production volume and additional capital  investments
made during fiscal 2004


net income

     as a result of the various factors noted above  net income increased 251
to 1786  million  for fiscal year 2003  compared to 1428  million for fiscal
year 2002

     the  increase  in net sales  during  fiscal 2002 was  primarily  due to the
introduction  of 22 new products and overall  demand for our consumer  products
total consumer and aviation units sold increased 170 to 1557000 in 2002 from
1331000 in 2001 in general  management  believes that continuous  innovation
and the introduction of new products are essential for future revenue growth

     the increase in consumer net sales was primarily due to the introduction of
18 new consumer  products and overall demand for our consumer  products as total
units sold were up 171  it is managements  belief that the continued  demand
for the companys consumer products is due to the emergence of the gps market in
general  and overall  increased  consumer  awareness  of the  capabilities  and
applications of gps

     the increase in aviation net sales for fiscal 2002 was primarily due to the
introduction of four new products  increased  penetration  into the oem market
and  significant  reductions  of the  restrictions  placed on  general  aviation
following the events of september 11 2001 while temporary flight  restrictions
tfrs continue to impact general aviation the flying community is adapting to
these changes and returning to the skies in greater numbers  should the federal
aviation  administration  faa impose more  restrictions  or elect to shutdown
us airspace in the future  these factors could have a material adverse effect
on our business

     the increase in gross profit is primarily attributed to the introduction of
22 new products and overall demand for our consumer products the improvement in
gross  margin  was  primarily  due to the  introduction  of  new  higher  margin
products  improved  manufacturing  efficiencies  on many  of the  new  products
introduced throughout the year and a reduction of material costs

     the increase in the consumer  segment gross profit is primarily  attributed
to the  introduction  of 18 new  consumer  products  and overall  demand for our
consumer products

     the increase in the aviation  segment  gross profit is primarily due to the
increase in  revenues  associated  with the  introduction  of four new  aviation
products  increased  penetration  into the oem  market  and a  return  to less
restricted airspace for general aviation aircraft  the decrease in gross margin
as a percentage of net revenues for the aviation segment is primarily attributed
to product mix as we  experienced  a 194  increase in lower margin panel mount
unit sales during 2002 when compared to 2001

     the increase in selling  general and administrative expense was primarily
attributable to increases in employment  generally across the organization  net
increase of 146 employees  increased  advertising  costs up 133 associated
primarily with new product  releases  additional  staffing in the customer call
center  and  increases in insurance  premiums  overall  selling  general and
administrative  expenses  increased at a lower rate than  revenues due to strong
demand for newly introduced and existing consumer products

     the increase in research and  development  expense  during  fiscal 2002 was
primarily  attributable to the development and  introduction of 22 new products
and the addition of 67 new engineers to our staff  management believes that one
of the key strategic initiatives for future growth and success of the company is
continuous innovation development and introduction of new products

     the majority of the difference  between 2001 and 2002 was caused by foreign
currency gains in 2001  interest  income for fiscal 2002 decreased  relative to
fiscal  2001 due to the fall in  interest  rates  reducing  the  returns on the
companys cash and cash equivalents interest expense decreased from fiscal 2001
to fiscal 2002 due primarily to the reduction of debt and a lower  interest rate
environment during fiscal 2002

     during  fiscal  2002 the  companys  position  was  neutral  with regard to
foreign  currency  exchange  gains  and  losses  as  the  us  dollar  was  at
approximately the same level at the beginning of 2002 relative to the new taiwan
dollar 3517 ntdusd as it was at the end of fiscal 2002 3490  ntdusd  in
fiscal 2001 there was an 116 million gain due to the  significantly  increased
strength of the us  dollar compared to the new taiwan dollar during 2001 when
the exchange  rate  increased  to 3517  ntdusd at december 29 2001 from 3301
ntdusd at december 30 2000

income tax provision

     income tax expense increased by 13 million to 399 million  for fiscal
year 2002 from  386  million  for fiscal  year 2001 due to our higher  taxable
income the effective tax rate was 219 for fiscal 2002 versus 254 for fiscal
2001  the  decrease in tax rate is due  primarily  to  additional  tax benefits
received  from taiwan as a result of our  continued  capital  investment  in our
manufacturing facilities there


net income

     as a result of the above  net income increased 259 to 1428 million for
fiscal year 2002 compared to 1134 million for fiscal year 2001


liquidity and capital resources

     net cash generated by operations was 1752 million  1754  million  and
1300 for fiscal years 2003  2002 and 2001  respectively  we operate with a
customer  oriented  approach and seek to maintain  sufficient  inventory to meet
customer  demand  because we desire to respond  quickly  to our  customers  and
minimize order fulfillment time our inventory levels are generally  substantial
enough to meet most demand we also attempt to carry sufficient inventory levels
of key components so that potential supplier shortages have as minimal an impact
as possible on our ability to deliver our finished  products  we  significantly
increased  our raw  material  inventories  in late 2003 in  anticipation  of new
product  releases  in the  first  half of 2004  and  also as a  response  to the
significant  increase in the leadtime of high dollar  components  such as lcds
and flash memory  in addition  we prefer to have sufficient  finished goods on
hand to meet  anticipated  demand for our  products  finished  goods  inventory
levels also continued to grow  gradually as a function of our growing sales  we
were able to reduce  inventory  levels  during  fiscal year 2002 by 36 million
when  compared to fiscal year end 2001  without  impairing  our ability to meet
customer  demand  by effectively  managing the  introduction of 22 new products
during the year we expect that inventory  levels may decrease during the latter
half of  fiscal  2004 as raw  materials  inventories  are  consumed  during  the
manufacture and delivery of new products in the first half of 2004

     capital  expenditures  in 2003 totaled 328 million  an increase of 204
million over fiscal 2002  this increase in 2003 was primarily  attributable  to
the  initiation  of expansion of our olathe  kansas  facility 17 million and
maintenance capital expenditures 34 million during fiscal 2002 our capital
expenditures  totaled  124  million  the  expenditures  in  fiscal  2002 were
primarily related to general corporate  purposes 98 million and the addition
of  surfacemount  production  equipment  in both the olathe  kansas and shijr
taiwan facilities 26 million

     we have budgeted  approximately 60 million of capital  expenditures during
fiscal  2004 to include  construction  costs  related to the  completion  of our
facilities expansion in olathe kansas and purchases of production machinery and
equipment to expand capacity in the shijr taiwan facility

     in addition to capital  expenditures  in 2003 cash flow used in  investing
relates to the 382 million acquisition of ups aviation  technologies  renamed
garmin  at  the  purchase  of  fixed  income  securities  associated  with the
investment  of our onhand  cash  balances  and  approximately  23  million of
intangible assets the companys average return on its investments during fiscal
2003 was  approximately  15 in 2002 cash flow used in investing  principally
related  to  the  purchase  of  fixed  income  securities  associated  with  the
investment of our onhand cash balances and approximately  135 million related
to the  purchase  of  licenses  of which  115  million  consists  of  prepaid
royalties  under  our  license  agreement  with  palmsource  inc  for the palm
operating  system it is managements goal to invest the onhand cash consistent
with the companys  investment  policy  which has been approved by the board of
directors  the  investment  policys  primary  purpose is to preserve  capital
maintain an  acceptable  degree of  liquidity  and  maximize  yield  within the
constraint of maximum  safety  the companys  average return on its investments
during fiscal year 2002 was approximately 16

     cash flow used in financing activities during 2003 relates primarily to the
payment  of a  dividend  540  million  and  reduction  of our  debt  200
million  the company  retired  approximately  200 million of longterm  debt
during fiscal 2003 which  represented the remainder of an outstanding  issue of


                                       26

industrial revenue bonds the employee stock option exercises and employee stock
purchase plan purchases  generated a 43 million  source of cash in 2003  cash
flow used in financing activities during 2002 relates primarily to the reduction
of our debt the company  retired  approximately  122 million of its longterm
debt during  fiscal 2002  consisting  in good part of an  outstanding  issue of
industrial  revenue  bonds  the employee  stock  purchase plan and stock option
exercises were a 21 million  source of cash in 2002  during 2001 the company
repurchased  595200  shares of its  common  shares  under its stock  repurchase
program that was  approved by the board of  directors on september  24 2001 and
expired on december 31 2002

     we currently use cash flow from operations to fund our capital expenditures
and to support  our  working  capital  requirements  we expect that future cash
requirements  will  principally be for capital  expenditures and working capital
requirements

     cash dividends paid to shareholders were 540 million  00 million 00
million  and 290  million  during  fiscal  years 2003  2002  2001 and 2000
respectively  included in cash dividends for fiscal 2000 was a special onetime
dividend  of  174  million  that  was  paid  in  order  to  provide  funds  to
shareholders  to pay  withholding  taxes and stock transfer taxes related to the
reorganization of garmin corporation

     we believe that our existing  cash  balances and cash flow from  operations
will be sufficient to meet our projected capital  expenditures  working capital
and other cash requirements at least through the end of fiscal 2004

recent accounting pronouncements

     in december 2002 the fasb issued sfas no 148 accounting for stockbased
compensation  transition and disclosure this statement requires all entities
with  stockbased  employee  compensation  arrangements  to  provide  additional
disclosures in their summary of significant  accounting policies note since the
company uses the intrinsic value method of accounting  principles  board apb
opinion no 25  accounting  for stock  issued to  employees  the  accounting
policies  note  includes  a tabular  presentation  of pro forma net  income  and
earnings  per share  using the fair value  method  prescribed  by sfas no  123
accounting for stockbased  compensation  also sfas no 148 permits entities
changing to the fair value method of accounting for employee stock  compensation
to choose from one of three transition  methods  the prospective  method  the
modified  prospective method or the retroactive  restatement  method  finally
sfas no 148 requires the company to make  interimperiod  pro forma disclosures
if stockbased compensation is accounted for under the intrinsic value method in
any period  presented  the  expanded  annual  disclosure  requirements  and the
transition provisions were effective for the companys fiscal year 2002 the new
interim period disclosures were required in the companys  financial  statements
for  interim  periods  beginning  in the  first  quarter  of fiscal  2003  this
statement did not have a material impact on the companys  results of operations
or financial condition

     in july  2001  the  fasb  issued  sfas  no  143  accounting  for  asset
retirement   obligations  the  objective  of  this  statement  is  to  provide
accounting  guidance for legal  obligations  associated  with the  retirement of
longlived  assets by  requiring  the fair  value of a  liability  for the asset
retirement  obligation  to be  recognized in the period in which it is incurred
when the liability is initially  recognized  the asset  retirement costs should
also be capitalized by increasing the carrying amount of the related  longlived
asset  the  liability is then accreted to its present value each period and the
capitalized  costs are depreciated over the useful life of the associated asset
this statement is effective for fiscal years  beginning after june 15 2002 and
did not have a material impact on our financial statements

     at its november 2002  meeting  the eitf reached a consensus on issue 0021
accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverable  which provides
a  model  to  be  used  in  the  context  of  a  multipledeliverable   revenue
arrangement  in determining  a how the  arrangement  consideration  should be
measured  b whether the arrangement  should be divided into separate units of
accounting  and  if so  c  how  the  arrangement  consideration  should  be
allocated  to the separate  units of  accounting  issue 0021 is effective  for
revenue  arrangements  entered  into  in  fiscal  periods  annual  or  interim
beginning after june 15 2003 with earlier adoption  permitted  companies also
are  permitted to adopt issue 0021 by reporting  the change in  accounting as a
cumulative effect adjustment in accordance with apb opinion no 20  accounting
changes  and fasb statement no 3  reporting  accounting  changes in interim
financial  statements  the  adoption of this  standard did not have a material
impact on the companys results of operations or financial condition

     in january 2003  the financial  accounting  standards  board fasb issued
interpretation   no  46   consolidation  of  variable   interest   entities
interpretation  no 46 requires that the assets  liabilities and results of the
activity  of  variable  interest  entities be  consolidated  into the  financial
statements  of  the  company  that  has  the  controlling   financial  interest
interpretation  no 46 also  provides the framework  for  determining  whether a
variable  interest  entity should be consolidated  based on voting  interests or
significant  financial support provided to it interpretation no 46 will become
effective  for the  company on march 31  2004 for  variable  interest  entities
created  prior  to  december  31  2003  we  do  not  expect  the  adoption  of
interpretation  no 46 to have a material impact on our results of operations or
financial condition


companyspecific trends and risks

     you should  carefully  consider  the risks  described  below  regarding  an
investment in our common shares the risks described below are not the only ones

facing our company additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us
or that we  currently  believe to be  immaterial  may also  impair our  business
operations  if  any of the  following  risks  occur  our  business  financial
condition or operating results could be materially adversely affected


risks related to the company

our global positioning system products depend upon satellites  maintained by the
united states department of defense if a significant number of these satellites
become  inoperable  unavailable  or are not  replaced or if the policies of the
united states  government for the use of the global  positioning  system without
charge are changed or if there is interference  with global  positioning  system
signals our business will suffer

     the  global  positioning   system  is  a  satellitebased   navigation  and
positioning  system  consisting of a constellation of orbiting  satellites  the
satellites and their ground  control and monitoring  stations are maintained and
operated by the united states  department of defense  the department of defense
does not  currently  charge  users for access to the  satellite  signals  these
satellites  and their  ground  support  systems are complex  electronic  systems
subject to  electronic  and  mechanical  failures  and  possible  sabotage  the
satellites were  originally  designed to have lives of 75 years and are subject
to damage by the hostile space  environment in which they operate  however  of
the current deployment of satellites in place some have been operating for more
than 13 years

     if  a  significant   number  of  satellites  were  to  become   inoperable
unavailable  or are not  replaced  it would  impair the current  utility of our
global  positioning  system  products  and the growth of current and  additional
market  opportunities  in  addition  there can be no  assurance  that the us
government  will remain  committed to the  operation and  maintenance  of global
positioning  system  satellites over a long period  or that the policies of the
us  government  that  provide  for the use of the  global  positioning  system
without charge and without accuracy  degradation will remain unchanged  because
of the increasing  commercial  applications  of the global  positioning  system
other us  government agencies may become involved in the administration or the
regulation of the use of global positioning system signals

     european  governments  have  expressed  interest in building an independent
satellite  navigation  system  known  as  galileo   depending  on  the  as  yet
undetermined  design and operation of this system  it is possible that it could
cause interference with global positioning system signals

     any of the foregoing  factors could affect the willingness of buyers of our
products to select global positioning  systembased products instead of products

a shut down of us airspace would harm our business

     on september  11  2001  terrorists  hijacked  and crashed four  passenger
aircraft  operated by commercial  air carriers  resulting in major loss of life
and   property   following  the  terrorist   attacks   the  federal   aviation
administration faa ordered all aircraft operating in the us to be grounded
for several  days in addition to this shut down of us  airspace  the general
aviation   industry  was  further   impacted  by  the  additional   restrictions
implemented  by the faa on those flights that fly utilizing  visual flight rules
vfr  the faa  restricted  vfr flight inside 30 enhanced class b a 2025 mile
radius around the 30 largest  metropolitan areas in the usa airspace areas the
aircraft owners and pilots  association aopa estimated that these restrictions
affected  approximately  41800 general aviation  aircraft based at 282 airports
inside  the 30  enhanced  class  b  airspace  areas  the  aopa  estimates  that
approximately  90 of all general  aviation  flights are conducted vfr and that
only 15 of general  aviation  pilots are  current to fly  utilizing  instrument
flight rules ifr

     the shut down of us airspace following  september 11 2001 caused reduced
sales of our  general  aviation  products  and  delays  in the  shipment  of our
products  manufactured in our taiwan manufacturing  facility to our distribution
facility in olathe  kansas  thereby adversely  affecting our ability to supply
new and existing products to our dealers and distributors

     any future shut down of us  airspace or  imposition  of  restrictions  on
general  aviation  could  have a material  adverse  effect on our  business  and
financial results

any reallocation of radio frequency  spectrum could cause  interference with the
reception of global positioning system signals this interference could harm our
business

     our global  positioning  system  technology  is dependent on the use of the
standard  positioning  service sps  provided by the us  governments  global
positioning system  satellites  the global positioning system operates in radio
frequency  bands that are  globally  allocated  for radio  navigation  satellite
services   the  assignment  of  spectrum  is  controlled  by  an  international
organization known as the international  telecommunications  union itu  the
federal  communications  commission fcc is responsible for the assignment of
spectrum for  nongovernment  use in the united  states in  accordance  with itu
regulations  any itu or fcc reallocation of radio frequency spectrum including
frequency band  segmentation  or sharing of spectrum  could cause  interference
with the reception of global  positioning  system signals and may materially and
adversely  affect the utility and  reliability of our products  which would in
turn  have a material  adverse  effect on our operating  results  in addition
emissions  from  mobile  satellite  service  and other  equipment  operating  in
adjacent  frequency  bands or inband may  materially  and  adversely  affect the
utility  and  reliability  of our  products  which  could  result in a material
adverse effect on our operating results


ultrawideband  radio  devices  could cause  interference  with the reception of
global  positioning  system  signals if the fcc were to change  its rules  this
interference could harm our business

     on february 13 2003  the fcc adopted a memorandum  opinion and order the
order  that  allows a limited  number of  ultrawideband  uwb  devices to
operate on a licensed basis in the frequency band used by the global positioning
system the order limits these devices to use by qualified  emergency  officials
at emission  limits  that  protect the global  positioning  system  the fcc has
stated  that it plans to review the rules of  operation  for uwb  devices  again
within a twelve to eighteen  month period  following the date of adoption of the
order  if the fcc were to issue a further  rule  authorizing  operation  of uwb
devices in the frequency  band used by the global  positioning  system at higher
power  levels  than  those  set  out  in  the  order  or  otherwise  change  the
definitional  or  operational  characteristics  of permitted  uwb devices  such
devices might cause interference with the reception of global positioning system
signals  such interference  could reduce demand for global  positioning  system
products  in the  future  any  resulting  change in market  demand  for  global
positioning  system  products  could  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on our
financial results


if we are not successful in the continued  development  introduction  or timely
manufacture of new products demand for our products could decrease

     we expect that a significant portion of our future revenue will continue to
be derived from sales of newly introduced products  the market for our products
is characterized by rapidly changing technology evolving industry standards and
changes in  customer  needs  if we fail to modify or improve  our  products  in
response to changes in technology  industry  standards or customer  needs  our
products could rapidly become less competitive or obsolete  we must continue to
make significant investments in research and development in order to continue to
develop new products  enhance existing  products and achieve market  acceptance
for such products  however  there can be no assurance that  development  stage
products  will  be  successfully  completed  or  if  developed   will  achieve
significant customer acceptance

     if we are unable to  successfully  develop and  introduce  competitive  new
products  and enhance our existing  products  our future results of operations
would be adversely  affected  our pursuit of necessary  technology  may require
substantial time and expense we may need to license new technologies to respond
to technological change these licenses may not be available to us on terms that
we can accept or may  materially  change the gross  profits  that we are able to
obtain on our  products  we may not  succeed in  adapting  our  products to new
technologies  as  they  emerge  development  and  manufacturing  schedules  for
technology products are difficult to predict and there can be no assurance that
we will achieve timely initial  customer  shipments of new products  the timely
availability  of these products in volume and their  acceptance by customers are
important  to our  future  success  we have  previously  experienced  delays in
shipping  certain of our products and any future delays  whether due to product

                                       30
page

development delays  manufacturing delays lack of market acceptance  delays in
regulatory approval  or otherwise  could have a material adverse effect on our
results of operations


if we do not correctly anticipate demand for our products we may not be able to
secure sufficient quantities or costeffective  production of our products or we
could have costly excess production or inventories

     historically  we have  experienced  steady  increases  in  demand  for our
products  although  we did  experience  a decline  in demand  for our  aviation
products in 2001 due to declining economic  conditions and the shut down of us
airspace as a result of the  terrorist  attacks that  occurred on september  11
2001  and we have  generally  been  able to  increase  production  to meet that
demand however the demand for our products depends on many factors and will be
difficult to forecast  we expect that it will become more difficult to forecast
demand as we introduce and support  multiple  products and as competition in the
market for our products intensifies  significant unanticipated  fluctuations in
demand could cause the following problems in our operations

         o if demand increases beyond what we forecast we would have to rapidly
           increase production we would depend on suppliers to provide
           additional volumes of components and those suppliers might not be
           able to increase production rapidly enough to meet unexpected demand

         o rapid increases in production levels to meet unanticipated demand
           could result in higher costs for manufacturing and supply of
           components and other expenses these higher costs could lower our
           profit margins further if production is increased rapidly
           manufacturing quality could decline which may also lower our
           margins

         o if forecasted demand does not develop we could have excess
           production resulting in higher inventories of finished products and
           components which would use cash and could lead to writeoffs of some
           or all of the excess inventories lower than forecasted demand could
           also result in excess manufacturing capacity at our facilities which
           could result in lower margins


we may become subject to significant product liability costs

     if our aviation products malfunction or contain errors or defects airplane
collisions or crashes could occur resulting in property damage  personal injury
or death  malfunctions or errors or defects in our marine navigational products
could cause boats to run aground or cause  other  wreckage  personal  injury or
death  if any of  these  events  occurs  we could be  subject  to  significant
liability for personal injury and property damage we maintain insurance against
accidentrelated  risks  involving  our  products  however  there  can  be  no
assurance that such  insurance  would be sufficient to cover the cost of damages
to others or that such insurance  will continue to be available at  commercially
reasonable  rates  if we are unable to maintain  sufficient  insurance to cover
product liability costs our business could be harmed


we  depend on our  suppliers  some of which are the sole  source  for  specific
components  and our production would be seriously harmed if these suppliers are
not able to meet our demand and alternative sources are not available or if the
costs of components rise

     we are dependent on third party  suppliers for various  components  used in
our current  products  some of the components  that we procure from third party
suppliers include semiconductors and  electroluminescent  panels liquid crystal
displays  memory chips and microprocessors  the cost quality and availability
of  components  are  essential  to the  successful  production  and  sale of our
products  some  components  we use are  from  sole  source  suppliers  certain
applicationspecific  integrated circuits  incorporating our proprietary designs
are manufactured for us by sole source suppliers alternative sources may not be
currently available for these sole source components

     in  the  past  we  have  experienced  shortages   particularly  involving
components  that are also used in cellular  phones  in  addition  if there are
shortages in supply of  components  the costs of such  components  may rise if
suppliers are unable to meet our demand for  components on a timely basis and if

                                       31
page

we are unable to obtain an alternative source or if the price of the alternative
source is  prohibitive  or if the costs of  components  rise  our  ability  to
maintain timely and costeffective production of our products would be seriously
harmed

     we license mapping data for use in our products from various sources there
are only a limited  number of suppliers  of mapping  data for each  geographical
region if we are unable to continue  licensing such mapping data and are unable
to obtain an alternative  source  or if the price of the alternative  source is
prohibitive our ability to supply mapping data for use in our products would be
seriously harmed


we rely on  independent  dealers  and  distributors  to sell our  products  and
disruption to these channels would harm our business

     because we sell a majority  of our  products  to  independent  dealers  and
distributors  we are subject to many risks  including  risks  related to their
inventory  levels and support for our products  in particular  our dealers and
distributors  maintain  significant levels of our products in their inventories
if dealers and  distributors  attempt to reduce  their levels of inventory or if
they do not maintain  sufficient levels to meet customer demand our sales could
be negatively impacted

     our dealers and distributors also sell products offered by our competitors
if our  competitors  offer our dealers and  distributors  more favorable  terms
those  dealers  and  distributors  may  deemphasize  or  decline  to carry  our
products  in the future  we may not be able to retain or attract a  sufficient
number of  qualified  dealers  and  distributors  if we are unable to  maintain
successful  relationships  with  dealers  and  distributors  or  to  expand  our
distribution channels our business will suffer


failure to manage our growth and expansion  effectively  could adversely  impact
our business

     our ability to  successfully  offer our products and implement our business
plan in a rapidly evolving market requires an effective  planning and management
process  we continue to increase the scope of our operations  domestically  and
internationally and have grown our shipments and headcount  substantially  this
growth has placed and our anticipated growth in future operations will continue
to place a significant strain on our management systems and resources


our  business  may  suffer  if we are not  able to hire  and  retain  sufficient
qualified personnel or if we lose our key personnel

     our future success depends partly on the continued  contribution of our key
executive  engineering  sales  marketing  manufacturing  and  administrative
personnel  we currently do not have  employment  agreements with any of our key
executive  officers  we do not have key man  life  insurance  on any of our key
executive  officers and do not currently  intend to obtain such  insurance  the
loss of the  services  of any of our  senior  level  management  or  other  key
employees  could  harm our  business  recruiting  and  retaining  the  skilled
personnel  we require to maintain  our market  position  may be  difficult  for
example  in some recent years there has been a nationwide shortage of qualified
electrical  engineers and software  engineers who are necessary for us to design
and develop new products and  therefore  it has sometimes  been  challenging to
recruit such personnel  if we fail to hire and retain qualified  employees  we
may not be able to maintain and expand our business


our sales and gross margins for our products may fluctuate or erode

     our sales and gross margins for our products may  fluctuate  from period to
period due to a number of factors  including product mix  competition and unit
volumes in particular the average selling prices of a specific product tend to
decrease over that products life to offset such  decreases  we intend to rely
primarily on obtaining yield  improvements and corresponding  cost reductions in
the  manufacture  of existing  products and on  introducing  new  products  that
incorporate  advanced  features  and  therefore  can be sold at  higher  average
selling  prices  however  there  can be no  assurance  that we will be able to
obtain any such yield  improvements or cost reductions or introduce any such new
products in the future  to the extent that such cost reductions and new product

                                       32
page

introductions do not occur in a timely manner or our customers  products do not
achieve  market  acceptance  our business  financial  condition and results of
operations could be materially  adversely affected  as we introduce new product
lines that serve personal  digital  assistant  pda  and original  equipment
manufacturer  automotive  and sensor  board  applications  we may  experience a
decline in our overall gross margins from sales of these potentially high volume
but low margin product lines


our quarterly operating results are subject to fluctuations and seasonality

     our  operating  results  are  difficult  to predict  our future  quarterly
operating results may fluctuate significantly  if this occurs the price of our
stock would likely decline as we expand our operations our operating expenses
particularly  our sales  marketing  and research  and  development  costs  may
increase as a percentage of our sales if revenues decrease and we are unable to
reduce those costs rapidly our operating results would be negatively affected

     historically  our revenues have usually been weaker in the first and third
quarters of each fiscal  year and have  from time to time  been lower than the
preceding quarter our devices are highly consumeroriented and consumer buying
is  traditionally  lower in these  quarters  sales of certain  of our  consumer
products  tend to be  higher  in our  second  fiscal  quarter  due to  increased
consumer  spending for such products during the recreational  marine and fishing
season  sales of certain of our consumer products also tend to be higher in our
fourth fiscal quarter due to increased  consumer spending patterns on electronic
devices  during the  holiday  season  in  addition  we attempt to time our new
product  releases to coincide with relatively  higher  consumer  spending in the
second  and  fourth  fiscal  quarters   which  contributes  to  these  seasonal
variations


our quarterly financial statements will reflect fluctuations in foreign currency
translation

     our  taiwan  subsidiary  holds  and  is  expected  to  continue  to  hold
significant cash cash equivalents and marketable securities  because the us
dollar is the primary  currency for our  business and in order to  substantially
reduce the economic  consequence  of any  variation in the exchange rate for the
us dollar and the new taiwan dollar on these assets  management  expects that
the taiwan subsidiary will continue to hold the majority of these assets in us
dollar or us dollar denominated instruments  nonetheless  us gaap requires
the company at the end of each  accounting  period to translate  into new taiwan
dollars all such us dollar  denominated  assets held by our taiwan subsidiary
this  translation  is required  because the new taiwan dollar is the  functional
currency of the subsidiary this us gaapmandated translation will cause us to
recognize gain or loss on our financial statements as the new taiwan dollarus
dollar  exchange  rate varies  such gain or loss will create  variations in our
earnings per share because there is minimal cash impact caused by such exchange
rate  variations  management will continue to focus on the companys  operating
performance before the impact of the foreign currency translation


if we are unable to compete  effectively with existing or new  competitors  our
resulting loss of competitive  position could result in price reductions  fewer
customer orders reduced margins and loss of market share

     the  markets  for  our  products  are  highly  competitive  and  we  expect
competition  to  increase  in  the  future   many  of  our   competitors   have
significantly  greater financial  technical and marketing resources than we do
these  competitors  may be able  to  respond  more  rapidly  to new or  emerging
technologies  or  changes  in  customer  requirements  they may also be able to
devote  greater  resources  to the  development  promotion  and  sale of  their
products increased competition could result in price reductions fewer customer
orders  reduced  margins  and loss of market  share  our  failure  to  compete
successfully  against  current or future  competitors  could  seriously harm our
business financial condition and results of operations


our intellectual property rights are important to our operations and we could
suffer loss if they infringe upon others rights or are infringed upon by
others

     we rely on a  combination  of  patents  copyrights  trademarks  and trade
secrets  confidentiality provisions and licensing arrangements to establish and
protect  our  proprietary  rights  to this end  we hold  rights to a number of

                                       33
page

patents and registered  trademarks and regularly file applications to attempt to
protect  our  rights in new  technology  and  trademarks  however  there is no
guarantee that our patent  applications will become issued patents  or that our
trademark  applications will become  registered  trademarks  moreover  even if
approved our patents or trademarks may thereafter be successfully challenged by
others or otherwise  become  invalidated for a variety of reasons  in addition
the only  patents  we have  obtained  are us  patents  thus  any  patents or
trademarks  we  currently  have  or may  later  acquire  may  not  provide  us a
significant competitive advantage

     third parties may claim that we are infringing their intellectual  property
rights  such claims  could have a serious  adverse  effect on our  business and
financial condition  from time to time we receive letters alleging infringement
of patents  litigation  concerning  patents or other  intellectual  property is
costly and time  consuming  we may seek licenses  from such  parties  but they
could refuse to grant us a license or demand commercially unreasonable terms we
might not have sufficient  resources to pay for the licenses  such infringement
claims could also cause us to incur  substantial  liabilities  and to suspend or
permanently  cease  the  use  of  critical  technologies  or  processes  or  the
production or sale of major products


failure to obtain  required  certifications  of our  products on a timely  basis
could harm our business

     we have certain  products  especially  in our aviation  segment  that are
subject to governmental and similar  certifications before they can be sold for
example  federal aviation  administration faa certification is required for
all of our  aviation  products  that  are  intended  for  installation  in  type
certificated aircraft to the extent required certification is an expensive and
time  consuming  process  that  requires  significant  focus and  resources  an
inability to obtain or excessive delay in obtaining  such certifications could
have an adverse effect on our ability to introduce new products and  therefore
our  operating  results  in addition  we cannot  assure you that our certified
products will not be decertified any such decertification could have an adverse
effect on our operating results


our business is subject to economic  political and other risks  associated with
international sales and operations

     our  business  is  subject  to  risks   associated   with  doing   business
internationally  we  estimate  that  approximately  29 of our net sales in the
fiscal  year  ended   december  27  2003   represented   products   shipped  to
international destinations accordingly our future results could be harmed by a
variety of international factors including

        o changes in foreign currency exchange rates


        o changes in a specific countrys or regions political or economic
          conditions particularly in emerging markets

        o trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements

        o potentially negative consequences from changes in tax laws

        o difficulty in managing widespread sales and manufacturing operations
          and

        o less effective protection of intellectual property


we may experience  unique economic and political risks associated with companies
that operate in taiwan

     relations  between taiwan and the peoples republic of china also referred
to as the prc and other factors affecting the political or economic  conditions
of taiwan in the future  could  affect our business and the market price and the
liquidity  of our  shares  our  principal  manufacturing  facilities  where  we
manufacture all of our products except our panelmounted aviation products are
located in taiwan

                                       34
page

     taiwan  has a  unique  international  political  status  the  prc  asserts
sovereignty over all of china  including taiwan  certain other islands and all
of mainland  china  the prc government does not recognize the legitimacy of the
taiwan  government  although  significant  economic and cultural relations have
been  established  during  recent  years  between  taiwan  and the prc  the prc
government  has  indicated  that it may use military  force to gain control over
taiwan in certain  circumstances  such as the  declaration of  independence  by
taiwan relations between taiwan and the prc have on occasion adversely affected
the  market  value of  taiwanese  companies  and  could  negatively  affect  our
operations in taiwan in the future


there is uncertainty as to our shareholders  ability to enforce certain foreign
civil liabilities in the cayman islands and taiwan

     we are a cayman islands company and a substantial portion of our assets are
located outside the united states  particularly in taiwan  as a result it may
be difficult for you to effect  service of process within the united states upon
us in  addition  there is  uncertainty  as to whether the courts of the cayman
islands or taiwan would  recognize or enforce  judgments of united states courts
obtained  against  us  predicated  upon the civil  liability  provisions  of the
securities  laws of the united states or any state  thereof  or be competent to
hear  original  actions  brought  in the  cayman  islands  or taiwan  against us
predicated upon the securities laws of the united states or any state thereof


our shareholders may face difficulties in protecting their interests because we
are incorporated under cayman islands law

     our  corporate  affairs are  governed  by our  memorandum  and  articles of
association  and by the companies law 2003  revision and the common law of the
cayman   islands   the   rights   of  our   shareholders   and  the   fiduciary
responsibilities  of our directors  under cayman  islands law are not as clearly
established   as  under   statutes  or  judicial   precedent   in  existence  in
jurisdictions in the united states  therefore our public shareholders may have
more  difficulty  in  protecting  their  interests in the face of actions by the
management directors or our controlling shareholders than would shareholders of
a corporation  incorporated in a jurisdiction  in the united states  due to the
comparatively less developed nature of cayman islands law in this area


we may pursue strategic  acquisitions  investments  strategic  partnerships or
other  ventures  and our  business  could be  materially  harmed  if we fail to
successfully identify complete and integrate such transactions

     we intend to evaluate  acquisition  opportunities and opportunities to make
investments in complementary businesses  technologies services or products or
to enter into any strategic  partnerships with parties who can provide access to
those assets  additional product or services  offerings or additional  industry
expertise  in august  2003  we acquired  ups  aviation  technologies  inc we
currently have no commitments to make any material  investments or acquisitions
or to enter into strategic partnerships we may not be able to identify suitable
acquisition  investment  or  strategic  partnership  candidates  or  if  we do
identify suitable candidates in the future we may not be able to complete those
transactions on commercially favorable terms or at all

     any future acquisition could result in difficulties  assimilating  acquired
operations and products and diversion of capital and managements attention away
from other business issues and opportunities  integration of acquired companies
may result in problems  related to integration  of technology and  inexperienced
management  teams  in addition  the key personnel of the acquired  company may
decide  not to work  for  us  our  management  has had  limited  experience  in
assimilating acquired organizations and products into our operations we may not
successfully integrate any operations personnel or products that we may acquire
in the future  if we fail to  successfully  integrate  such  transactions  our
business could be materially harmed

we have benefited in the past from taiwan  government tax incentives  offered on
certain high technology capital investments that may not always be available

     our  effective  tax rate is lower  than the us  federal  statutory  rate
because we have  benefited  from lower tax rates  since our  inception  and from
incentives  offered in taiwan  related  to our high  technology  investments  in
taiwan  the loss of these tax benefits  could have a significant  effect on our
financial results in the future


changes in our united states federal income tax  classification or in applicable
tax law could result in adverse tax consequences to our shareholders

     we do not believe that we or any of our  nonunited  states  subsidiaries
are  currently  a  foreign   personal  holding  company  or  passive  foreign
investment  company for united states  federal  income tax  purposes  we would
constitute a foreign personal holding company in any taxable year if 1 60 or
50 in any year  following the year in which we first became a foreign  personal
holding  company or more of our gross  income  were  foreign  personal  holding
company income which is generally income of a passive nature such as dividends
interest and royalties  the income test and 2 more than 50 of the voting
power or value of our equity were  owned  directly  or  indirectly  by five or
fewer us holders that are individuals the shareholder  test if we or any
of our nonunited  states  subsidiaries  are  classified as a foreign  personal
holding  company in any taxable  year  then each  shareholder  that is a united
states  person  would  be  required  to pay tax on its  pro  rata  share  of the
undistributed  foreign  personal holding income of such foreign personal holding
company  we currently  satisfy the shareholder test for qualifying as a foreign
personal  holding  company  but intend to manage our affairs so as to attempt to
avoid  satisfaction  of the income  test for  qualifying  as a foreign  personal
holding  company  or minimize the impact to our  shareholders if we satisfy the
income test  to the extent this  management  of our affairs would be consistent
with our business goals although we cannot assure you in this regard

     we do not expect to become a passive foreign investment  company  however
because the passive foreign investment company determination is made annually on
the basis of facts and circumstances  that may be beyond our control and because
the principles for applying the passive foreign investment company tests are not
entirely  clear  we cannot assure you that we will not become a passive foreign
investment  company if we are a passive foreign investment company in any year
then any of our  shareholders  that is a united states person could be liable to
pay  tax at  ordinary  income  tax  rates  plus an  interest  charge  upon  some
distributions by us or when that shareholder  sells our common shares at a gain
further  if we are classified as a passive  foreign  investment  company in any
year in which a  united  states  person  is a  shareholder  we  generally  will
continue to be treated as a passive foreign  investment  company with respect to
such shareholder in all succeeding  years  regardless of whether we continue to
satisfy the income or asset tests described above additional tax considerations
would  apply  if we or  any  of  our  subsidiaries  were  a  controlled  foreign
corporation or a personal holding company


risks relating to our shares

the markets for high technology stocks have experienced  extreme  volatility and
our share price may be subject to significant fluctuations and volatility

     the markets for high technology stocks have experienced  extreme volatility
that has often been  unrelated to the operating  performance  of the  particular
companies  these broad market  fluctuations  may  adversely  affect the trading
price of our common shares

our officers and directors exert substantial influence over us

     as of march 1 2004  members of our board of  directors  and our  executive
officers  together  with members of their  families  and  entities  that may be
deemed  affiliates of or related to such persons or entities  beneficially  own
approximately  45  of  our  outstanding  common  shares   accordingly   these
shareholders may be able to determine the outcome of corporate actions requiring
shareholder approval such as mergers and acquisitions  this level of ownership
may have a significant  effect in delaying  deferring or preventing a change in
control of garmin and may adversely  affect the voting and other rights of other
holders of our common shares


prior  to  2006   without  the  approval  of  a  majority  of  certain  of  our
shareholders  we may not  dispose  of our shares of garmin  corporation  or its
assets even if it would benefit all of our shareholders

     in connection  with the  reorganization  whereby  garmin became the holding
company for garmin corporation  shareholders of garmin corporation entered into
a shareholders agreement whereby each shareholder party to the agreement agreed
to take all reasonable  actions required to prevent the disposition by garmin of
any shares of garmin corporation or of substantially all of the assets of garmin
corporation  until after december 31 2005 except upon approval of a majority in
interest of such shareholders who are us citizens or residents certain of our
officers and directors own a substantial portion of these shares


provisions in our charter documents might deter  delay or prevent a third party
from acquiring us which could decrease the value of our shares

     our board of directors has the authority to issue up to 1000000 preferred
shares  and  to  determine  the  price  rights  preferences   privileges  and
restrictions  including voting rights of those shares without any further vote
or action by the  shareholders  this could have an adverse impact on the market
price of our  common  shares  we have no present  plans to issue any  preferred
shares  but we may do so  the rights of the  holders  of common  shares may be
subject  to  and  adversely  affected  by  the  rights of the  holders  of any
preferred shares that may be issued in the future in addition  we have adopted
a  classified  board of  directors  our  shareholders  are unable to remove any
director or the entire  board of directors  without a super  majority  vote  in
addition  a super  majority  vote is  required  to  approve  transactions  with
interested  shareholders   shareholders  do  not  have  the  right  to  call  a
shareholders  meeting  we have adopted a shareholders  rights plan which under
certain circumstances would significantly impair the ability of third parties to
acquire  control of us without prior  approval of our board of  directors  this
shareholders rights plan and the provisions in our charter documents could make
it more  difficult  for a third  party  to  acquire  us  even if doing so would
benefit our shareholders




item 7a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

         market sensitivity

     we have  market  risk  primarily  in  connection  with the  pricing  of our
products and services and the purchase of raw materials product pricing and raw
materials  costs  are both  significantly  influenced  by  semiconductor  market
conditions  historically during cyclical industry downturns we have been able
to offset  pricing  declines for our products  through a combination of improved
product mix and success in obtaining price reductions in raw materials costs

         inflation

     we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our business
financial  condition  or  results  of  operations  if our costs  were to become
subject  to  significant  inflationary  pressures  we may not be able to  fully
offset such higher costs through price increases our inability or failure to do
so could  adversely  affect our  business  financial  condition  and results of
operations

         foreign currency exchange rate risk

     the  operation  of the  companys  subsidiaries  in  international  markets
results in exposure to movements in currency  exchange  rates we generally have
not been significantly  affected by foreign exchange fluctuations because until
recently  the  taiwan  dollar  has  proven to be  relatively  stable  however
periodically we have experienced  significant  foreign currency gains and losses
due to the  strengthening  and  weakening of the us  dollar  the potential of
volatile  foreign  exchange  rate  fluctuations  in  the  future  could  have  a
significant effect on our results of operations

     the  principal   currency  involved  is  the  new  taiwan  dollar   garmin
corporation  located in shijr taiwan uses the local currency as the functional
currency the company translates all assets and liabilities at yearend exchange
rates and income and expense accounts at average rates during the year in order
to minimize the effect of the currency exchange  fluctuations on our net assets
we have elected to retain most of our taiwan  subsidiarys cash in us dollars
as discussed above the taiwan dollarus dollar exchange rate can be volatile
the exchange rate decreased 30 during 2003 and resulted in a foreign  currency
loss of 67 million  while the net effect of foreign  currency moves in fiscal
2002 was neutral  there were significant shifts in the exchange rate throughout
2002  the exchange  rate  increased  65 during 2001 and resulted in a foreign
currency  gain of 116  million  if the exchange  rate  decreased by a similar
percentage  a  comparable  foreign  currency  loss would be  recognized  a 10
positive or negative change in the us dollar exchange rate versus the new taiwan
dollar would have resulted in a foreign currency gain of 221 million positive
10 change or a foreign  currency loss of 221  million  negative 10 change
during 2003


         interest rate risk

     as of  december  27  2003  we have no  outstanding  longterm  debt  and
therefore no  debtrelated  interest  rate risk  upon  retiring the  industrial
revenue bond issue during 2003 as described above  garmin  international  inc
also  terminated  two interest  rate swap  agreements  one with a 100 million
notional  amount and another  with a 50 million  notional  amount at a cost of
06 million  the  companys  average  outstanding  debt during fiscal 2003 was
approximately 10 million  the average interest rate on debt during fiscal 2003
was 35

     at december  27  2003  the  company is exposed to  interest  rate risk in
connection  with its  investments  in marketable  securities  as interest rates
change  the unrealized  gains and losses  associated with those securities will
fluctuate accordingly  a hypothetical change of 10 in interest rates would not
have a material effect on such unrealized gains or losses at december 27 2003
unrealized gains on those securities were 28 million

company overview

     garmin is a leading  worldwide provider of navigation  communications and
information  devices  most of  which  are  enabled  by gps  technology  garmin
designs  develops  manufactures  and markets  under the garmin brand a diverse
family of  handheld  portable and fixed mount  gpsenabled  products and other
navigation communications and information products for the general aviation and
consumer  markets  each of  garmins  gps  products  utilizes  its  proprietary
integrated  circuit  and  receiver  designs to  collect  calculate  and display
location direction speed and other information in forms optimized for specific
uses


overview of the global positioning system

     the global positioning system  first made available by the us government
for commercial use in 1983 is a worldwide  navigation  system which enables the
precise   determination  of  geographic  location  using  established  satellite
technology  the system consists of a constellation of orbiting satellites  the
satellites and their ground  control and monitoring  stations are maintained and
operated by the united states department of defense  which maintains an ongoing
satellite  replenishment  program to ensure  continuous  global system coverage
access to the system is provided free of charge by the us government

     reception  of  gps  signals  from  the  satellites  requires  lineofsight
visibility between the satellites and the receiver  gps receivers  generally do
not work  indoors  and when a receiver is  outside  buildings  hills and dense
foliage can attenuate or block reception gps receivers can be very compact and
it is not necessary to have a large dish antenna to receive gps signals

     prior to may 2000 the us  department of defense  intentionally  degraded
the  accuracy  of  civilian  gps  signals  in  a  process   known  as  selective
availability  sa for national  security  purposes  sa variably degraded gps
position accuracy to a radius of 100 meters on may 2 2000 the us department
of defense  discontinued  sa with sa removed  a gps receiver can calculate its
position to an accuracy of 10 meters or less  enhancing  the utility of gps for
most applications

     the  accuracy  and  utility of gps can be  enhanced  even  further  through
augmentation  techniques  which compute any  remaining  errors in the signal and
broadcast these corrections to a gps device the federal aviation administration
faa is developing a wide area augmentation system waas comprising ground
reference stations and additional  satellites which will improve the accuracy of
gps positioning available in the united states and portions of canada and mexico
to  approximately  3 meters  waas is  intended to support the use of gps as the
primary means of enroute  terminal and approach  navigation for aviation in the
united  states  the  increased  accuracy  offered by waas is  expected  also to
enhance the utility of waasenabled gps receivers for consumer applications the
faa has  stated  that it  expects  the waas  system  to have  initial  operating
capability by july 2003

research and development

     garmins product  innovations are driven by its strong emphasis on research
and  development  and the close  partnership  between  garmins  engineering and
manufacturing teams garmins products are created by its engineering and design
staff of  approximately  340  people  worldwide  garmins  manufacturing  staff
includes  manufacturing  process engineers who work closely with garmins design
engineers to ensure  manufacturability  and  manufacturing  cost control for its
products  garmins  design  staff  includes  industrial  designers  as well as
software  engineers  electrical  engineers  and  mechanical  engineers  garmin
believes the  industrial  design of its products has played an important role in
garmins  success  once a  development  project is initiated  and  approved  a
multidisciplinary  team is created to design the product and transition it into
manufacturing

manufacturing and operations

     garmin  believes  that one of its core  competencies  is its  manufacturing
capability at both its shijr  taiwan facility and its olathe  kansas facility
garmin  believes  that its  vertically  integrated  approach has provided it the
following competitive advantages

     reduced   timetomarket   utilizing  concurrent  engineering  techniques
garmins products are introduced to production at an early development stage and
the feedback  provided by manufacturing  is incorporated  into the design before
mass production begins in this manner garmin can significantly reduce the time
required to move a product from its design phase to mass production  deliveries
with improved quality and yields  reducing time to market has enabled garmin to
offer  several  industry  firsts  such as the  rino  gpsenabled  family  radio
servicegeneral  mobile  radio  service  twoway  radio  and the gns 430  which
integrates  traditional aviation navigation and communications  systems with gps
in a single package

     design and process optimization  using its manufacturing resources garmin
can rapidly  prototype  design  concepts  products  and  processes  in order to
achieve higher efficiency  lower cost and best value for the customer garmins
ability to fully explore product design and  manufacturing  process concepts has
enabled it to optimize  its designs to minimize  size and weight in a gps device
that is fully functional waterproof and rugged

     logistical agility operating its own manufacturing facilities helps garmin
minimize  problems  common  to  the  electronics  industry  such  as  component
shortages and long component lead times  many products can be  reengineered to
bypass  component  shortages or reduce cost and the new designs can quickly fill
the distribution pipeline  garmin can react rapidly to changes in market demand
by  maintaining  a  safety  stock of  longlead  components  or by  rescheduling
components from one product line to another

     garmins  design and  manufacturing  processes are certified to iso 90012
international quality standards developed by the international  organization for
standardization  garmins  taiwan  manufacturing  facility has also achieved qs
9000  quality  certification  qs  9000 is a  quality  standard  for  automotive
suppliers  in addition garmins aviation  panelmount products are designed and
manufactured according to processes which are approved and monitored by the faa


intellectual property

     garmins  success  and  ability  to  compete  is  dependent  in part on its
proprietary  technology  garmin relies on a combination  of patent  copyright
trademark  and trade  secret laws  as well as  confidentiality  agreements  to
establish and protect our proprietary  rights  as of march 7 2003 garmin held
97 us  patents that expire at various  dates no earlier than 2006 as of march
7 2003 garmin had 123 us patent applications pending  garmins us patents
do not create any patent rights in foreign countries in addition  garmin often
relies  on  licenses  of  intellectual  property  for use in its  business  for
example  garmin obtains licenses for digital cartography  technology for use in
our products from various sources  garmins registered us trademarks include

garmins  trademarks  include etrex legend  etrex mariner  rino ique que and
geko some of

page

garmins  patents and its  registered  trademarks  and  trademarks  are owned by
garmins subsidiary garmin corporation

     garmin  believes  that its continued  success  depends in large part on the
intellectual  skills of its employees and their ability to continue to innovate
garmin will continue to file and prosecute patent  applications when appropriate
to attempt to protect garmins rights in its proprietary technologies

     it is possible that garmins current patents or patents which it may later
acquire  may be successfully  challenged or invalidated in whole or in part it
is also  possible that garmin may not obtain  issued  patents for  inventions it
seeks to protect  it is also possible  that garmin may not develop  proprietary
products or technologies  in the future that are patentable  or that any patent
issued to garmin may not provide it with any competitive advantages or that the
patents  of others  will harm or  altogether  preclude  garmins  ability  to do
business   legal  protections  afford  only  limited  protection  for  garmins
technology   despite  garmins  efforts  to  protect  its  proprietary  rights
unauthorized  parties  may attempt to copy  aspects of  garmins  products or to
obtain and use information that garmin regards as proprietary litigation may be
necessary in the future to enforce garmins  intellectual  property  rights  to
protect  its  trade  secrets  to  determine  the  validity  and  scope  of  the
proprietary  rights of others or to defend  against  claims of  infringement  or
invalidity  any  resulting  litigation  could result in  substantial  costs and
diversion of garmins  resources  garmins means of protecting its  proprietary
rights may not be adequate and garmins  competitors may  independently  develop
similar technology


regulations

     garmins  aviation  products  that are  intended for  installation  in type
certificated  aircraft  are  required to be  certified  by the faa its european
counterpart  the joint aviation authorities and other comparable organizations
before  they can be used in an  aircraft  the  telecommunications  industry  is
highly  regulated  and the regulatory  environment in which garmin  operates is
subject to change in accordance with federal  communication  commission fcc
rules and  regulations  wireless  transceiver and cellular handset products are
required  to be  certified  by the fcc and  comparable  authorities  in  foreign
countries where they are sold  garmins products sold in europe are required to
comply with relevant directives of the european commission a delay in receiving
required certifications for new products or enhancements to garmins products or
losing  certification  for garmins existing products could adversely affect its
business

     because garmin corporation one of the companys principal subsidiaries is
located in taiwan  foreign exchange control laws and regulations of taiwan with
respect to  remittances  into and out of taiwan  may have an impact on  garmins
operations  the  taiwan  foreign  exchange  control  statute  and  regulations
thereunder  provide that all foreign exchange  transactions must be executed by
banks  designated  to handle such  business by the ministry of finance of taiwan
and by the  central  bank  of  china  also  referred  to as  the  cbc  current
regulations favor  traderelated  foreign exchange  transactions  consequently
foreign  currency  earned from  exports of  merchandise  and services may now be
retained and used freely by exporters while all foreign currency needed for the
import of merchandise  and services may be purchased  freely from the designated
foreign exchange banks aside from traderelated foreign exchange  transactions
taiwan  companies and residents may without foreign  exchange  approval  remit
outside and into taiwan  foreign  currencies of up to 50 million and 5 million
respectively  or their  equivalent  each calendar year  currency  conversions
within the limits are  processed by the  designated  banks and do not have to be
reviewed  and  approved  by the cbc  the  above  limits  apply  to  remittances
involving  a  conversion  between new taiwan  dollars and us  dollars or other
foreign currencies the cbc typically approves foreign exchange in excess of the
limits  if a party  applies  with the cbc for  review  and  presents  legitimate
business  reasons  justifying  the currency  conversion  a requirement  is also
imposed on all  enterprises  to register all medium and  longterm  foreign debt
with the cbc

overview

     we are a leading  worldwide  provider  of  navigation  communications  and
information devices  most of which are enabled by global positioning system or
gps technology  we operate in two business segments the consumer and aviation
markets  both of our segments offer products through our network of independent
dealers and distributors however the nature of products and types of customers
for the two  segments  vary  significantly  as such  the  segments are managed
separately our consumer segment includes portable gps receivers and accessories
for marine  recreation  land and  automotive  applications  sold  primarily to
retail outlets  our aviation products are portable and panelmount avionics for
visual  flight  rules  and  instrument  flight  rules  navigation  and are  sold
primarily to retail outlets and certain aircraft manufacturers

     since our first products were delivered in 1991 we have generated positive
income from  operations each year and have funded our growth from these profits
our sales have  increased at a compounded  annual  growth rate of 23 since 1996
and our net income has increased at a compounded annual growth rate of 36 since
1996 all of this growth has been organic  none has occurred as a result of any
acquisition or merger

     since our  principal  locations  are in the united  states  taiwan and the
uk we experience some foreign currency fluctuations in our operating results
the functional currency of our european operations is the us dollar effective
in 2001 and the functional  currency of our asian  operations is the new taiwan
dollar  minimal  transactions of our european operations are now denominated in
british pound  sterling  we  experienced  00  million  116  million  70
million  and 15 million in foreign  currency  gains losses  during fiscal
years 2002  2001  2000 and 1999  respectively  to date we have not entered
into  hedging  transactions  with either the british  pound  sterling or the new
taiwan dollar although we may utilize hedging transactions in the future

critical accounting policies and estimates


general

     the  companys  discussion  and  analysis of its  financial  condition  and
results  of  operations  are based  upon the  companys  consolidated  financial
statements  which have been prepared in accordance with  accounting  principles
generally  accepted in the united states  the  presentation  of these financial
statements requires the company to make estimates and judgements that affect the
reported  amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and  expenses  and related
disclosure of  contingent  assets and  liabilities  on an ongoing  basis  the
company  evaluates its  estimates  including  those  related to customer  sales
programs and incentives  product returns bad debts inventories  investments
intangible assets  income taxes  warranty  obligations  and contingencies and
litigation  the company  bases its estimates on  historical  experience  and on
various  other  assumptions  that  are  believed  to  be  reasonable  under  the
circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making  judgements about
the carrying value of assets and liabilities  that are not readily apparent from
other sources  actual results may differ from these  estimates  under different
assumptions or conditions


revenue recognition

     the company  records  estimated  reductions  to revenue for customer  sales
programs and incentive offerings including rebates price protection promotions
and other  volumebased  incentives  the  reductions  to  revenue  are based on
estimates and judgements using  historical  experience and expectation of future
conditions  changes in these  estimates could  negatively  affect the companys
operating  results  these  incentives  are accrued for on a percentage of sales
basis and  reviewed  periodically  if market  conditions  were to decline  the
company  may take  actions to increase  customer  incentive  offerings  possibly
resulting in an  incremental  reduction of revenue at the time the  incentive is
offered


bad debt

     the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses
resulting  from the inability of its customers to make  required  payments  the
companys estimated losses are based on historical experience and expectation of
future conditions if the financial condition of the companys customers were to
deteriorate  resulting  in an  impairment  of their  ability to make  payments
additional allowances may be required


warranties

     the companys products sold are generally covered by a warranty for periods
ranging  from one to two  years  the  company  accrues a warranty  reserve  for
estimated costs to provide warranty services the companys estimate of costs to
service  its  warranty  obligations  is  based  on  historical   experience  and
expectation  of  future  conditions  to  the  extent  the  company  experiences
increased  warranty claim activity or increased costs  associated with servicing
those claims  its warranty  accrual will increase  resulting in decreased gross
profit


product liability

     the company has no product liability claims  outstanding as of december 28
2002 that are not covered by product liability insurance


inventory

     the  company  writes  down its  inventory  for  estimated  obsolescence  or
unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and
the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future

page

demand and market  conditions  if actual market  conditions  are less favorable
than those  projected by management  additional  inventory  writedowns  may be
required

investments

     investments  are  classified  as  available  for sale and  recorded at fair
value and unrealized investment gains and losses are reflected in stockholders
equity  investment income is recorded when earned and capital gains and losses
are recognized when investments are sold  investments are reviewed periodically
to determine if they have  suffered an  impairment  of value that is  considered
other than temporary  if investments  are determined to be impaired  a capital
loss is recognized at the date of determination

     testing for impairment of investments also requires significant  management
judgement   the  identification  of  potentially  impaired   investments   the
determination  of their fair value and the  assessment of whether any decline in
value is other than temporary are the key judgement  elements  the discovery of
new  information  and  the  passage  of  time  can  significantly  change  these
judgements  revisions of impairment  judgements  are made when new  information
becomes known and any resulting  impairment  adjustments are made at that time
the current  economic  environment and recent  volatility of securities  markets
increase the  difficulty  of  determining  fair value and  assessing  investment
impairment  the  same  influences  tend to  increase  the  risk of  potentially
impaired assets


income taxes

     while no valuation allowance has been recorded  it is the companys policy
to record a valuation  allowance  to reduce its deferred tax assets to an amount
that it believes is more likely than not to be  realized  while the company has
considered  future taxable income and ongoing  prudent and feasible tax planning
strategies in assessing the need for the valuation  allowance  in the event the
company  were to  determine  that it would not be able to realize all or part of
its net deferred  tax assets in the future  an  adjustment  to the deferred tax
assets  would be charged to income in the period  such  determination  was made
likewise  should the  company  determine  that it would be able to realize  its
deferred  tax  assets in the  future in excess of its net  recorded  amount  an
adjustment to the deferred tax assets would  increase  income in the period such
determination was made


impairments and restructuring charges

     the company has experienced no impairments of longlived assets securities
held for investment or goodwill no restructuring charges have been necessary


depreciation and amortization

     the company  depreciates  or amortizes  its assets using the  straightline
method


retirement and post retirement liabilities pension income and expense

     the retirement  benefits  provided by the company are classified as defined
contribution  plans  as this is the case  there is no retirement  liability to
fund  because the retirement  benefits  provided by the company are not defined
benefit plans  there are no funds held in trust and therefore no pension income
or expense disclosures are necessary


environmental liabilities

     the company is not aware of any environmental liabilities at this time


page


repurchase obligations

     the company has no repurchase obligations at this time

stockbased compensation

     the company  distributes  a small number of stock options each year as part
of the companys  compensation  package for  employees  employees  with certain
levels of  responsibility  within the company  are  eligible  for stock  options
grants  but the granting of options is at the  discretion  of the  compensation
committee of the board of directors and is not a contractual  obligation  stock
compensation  plans  are  discussed  in  detail  in  note  13 of  the  notes  to
consolidated financial statements


insurance loss reserves

     historically  the company has not experienced  losses related to general or
product liability claims therefore no loss reserves have been created


accounting terms and characteristics


net sales

     our net sales are  primarily  generated  through sales to our global dealer
and distributor  network and to original equipment  manufacturers  we recognize
sales when  products  are shipped  our sales are largely of a consumer  nature
therefore  backlog  levels are not  necessarily  indicative  of our future sales
results  we aim to  achieve a quick  turnaround  on orders we  receive  and we
typically ship most orders within 72 hours

     net sales are subject to some seasonal fluctuation typically sales of our
consumer  products are highest in the second  quarter  due to increased  demand
during the spring and summer marine season  and in the fourth  quarter  due to
increased demand during the holiday buying season  our aviation products do not
experience much seasonal variation but are more influenced by the timing of the
release of new products when the initial demand is typically the strongest


gross profit

     the most significant components of our cost of goods sold are raw material
labor and depreciation  raw material costs which are our most significant cost
item  have come down slightly as a percentage  of sales in recent years  as we
have  negotiated  lower raw material costs with our key suppliers  as a result
gross profit has improved  somewhat as a percentage  of sales when compared with
prior years

     in 2000 we  experienced  upward pricing  pressures on our high  technology
components  but  had  offset  those  with  efficiencies  in  our  manufacturing
processes we did not experience significant pricing pressure in fiscal 2001 and
fiscal 2002 our existing  practice of performing the design and  manufacture of
our  products  inhouse  has  enabled  us  to  utilize  alternative  lower  cost
components  from  different  suppliers  and  where  necessary  to redesign our
products  to permit us to use these  lower  cost  components  we  believe  that
because of our practice of performing the design  manufacture  and marketing of
our products inhouse  both our shijr taiwan and olathe  kansas manufacturing
plants have experienced  relatively low costs of manufacturing  compared to our
competition  in general  products manufactured in taiwan have been our highest
volume products  our manufacturing  labor costs historically have been lower in
taiwan than in olathe

     sales  price  variability  has had and can be expected to have an effect on
our gross profit  in the past prices of some of our handheld devices sold into
the consumer  market have declined due to market  pressures and  introduction of
new  products  sold at lower price  points  the average  selling  prices of our
aviation  products  have  decreased  due to  product  mix and  market  pressures
partially  offset by the  introduction of more advanced  products

page

sold at higher  prices  in  conjunction  with the  effects of lower labor costs
experienced  on taiwan  production  the effect of the sales  price  variability
inherent  within the mix of  gpsenabled  products sold could have a significant
impact on our gross profit


selling general and administrative expenses

     our selling general and administrative expenses consist primarily of

        o   salaries for sales and marketing personnel

        o   salaries and related costs for executives and administrative
            personnel

        o   advertising marketing and other brand building costs

        o   accounting and legal costs

        o   information systems and infrastructure costs

        o   travel and related costs and

        o   occupancy and other overhead costs

     since we plan to  increase  market  penetration  in the  future  we expect
selling  general and  administrative  expenses to continue to increase  for the
foreseeable future we intend to increase  advertising and marketing expenses in
order to build increased brand awareness in the consumer marketplace especially
as we enter into new markets  such as wireless and personal digital  assistants
pda  we also  intend to increase  our  customer  call  center  support as our
consumer  segment  continues to grow we do not anticipate  that these increased
expenses will significantly  impact our financial results in 2003 and subsequent
periods


research and development

     the majority of our research and development  costs represent  salaries for
our  engineers  costs  for  high  technology  components  used in  product  and
prototype  development  and  costs  of test  equipment  needed  during  product
development

     we have continued to grow our research and development  capabilities  since
our inception substantially all of the research and development of our products
is performed in the united states

     we  are  committed  to  increasing  the  level  of  innovative  design  and
development  of new  products  as we strive  for  expanded  ability to serve our
existing  consumer and aviation  markets as well as new markets for  gpsenabled
devices  we continue to grow our  research and  development  budget on absolute
terms  research  and  development  expenses may also grow at a faster rate when
compared to our projected revenue growth for fiscal year 2003


customers

     no customer  accounted  for greater than 10 of our sales in the year ended
december 28 2002 our top ten customers  accounted for approximately 25 of net
sales  we  have  experienced  average  sales  days  in  our  customer  accounts
receivable between 35 and 45 days since 1998

page

income taxes

     we have  experienced  a relatively  low effective tax rate in taiwan due to
lower marginal tax rates and substantial tax incentives offered by the taiwanese
government on certain  hightechnology capital investments  therefore  profits
earned in taiwan have been taxed at a lower rate than those in the united states
and europe as a result  our consolidated  effective tax rate was approximately
22 during 2002 we have taken advantage of this tax benefit in taiwan since our
inception and we expect to continue to benefit from lower effective tax rates at
least through 2007 the current  taiwan tax incentives  that garmin has received
approval for will end in 2007  we have applied for  additional  incentives  for
years beyond 2007  however  there can be no assurance that such tax incentives
will be granted after 2007


results of operations

year ended december 28 2002 from 3691 million for fiscal year ended december
29 2001 the increase during fiscal 2002 was primarily due to the  introduction
of 22 new products and overall demand for our consumer products  sales from our
consumer  products  accounted for 754 of net revenues for fiscal 2002 compared
to 713 during  fiscal 2001  sales from our aviation  products  accounted  for
246 of net  revenues  for fiscal 2002  compared to 287  during  fiscal 2001
total consumer and aviation units sold increased 170 to 1557000 in 2002 from

and the introduction of new products are essential for future revenue growth

     net sales for the consumer  segment  increased 873 million  or 332 to
3507 million for fiscal 2002 from 2634 million for fiscal 2001 the increase
was primarily due to the  introduction  of 18 new consumer  products and overall
demand  for our  consumer  products  as total  units  sold were up 171  it is
managements  belief  that  the  continued  demand  for the  companys  consumer
products  is due to the  emergence  of the gps market in  general  and  overall
increased consumer awareness of the capabilities and applications of gps

     net sales for the aviation  segment  increased  87  million  or 82 to
1145 million for fiscal 2002 from 1058 million for fiscal 2001 the increase
for fiscal 2002 was  primarily  due to the  introduction  of four new  products
increased  penetration  into the oem market  and significant  reductions of the
restrictions  placed on general  aviation  following the events of september 11
2001  while temporary  flight  restrictions  tfrs continue to impact general
aviation the flying community is adapting to these changes and returning to the
skies in greater  numbers  should the  federal  aviation  administration  faa
impose  more  restrictions  or elect to shutdown  us  airspace in the future
these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business

year and a reduction of material costs

     gross profit for the consumer segment increased 520 million or 393 to
1845  million for fiscal 2002 from 1325 million in fiscal 2001 the increase

     gross profit for the aviation segment  increased 49 million  or 74 to
705 million for fiscal 2002 from 656  million for fiscal 2001  the increase
in gross profit is primarily due to the increase in revenues associated with the
introduction of four new aviation products  increased  penetration into the oem
market and a return to less restricted  airspace for general aviation aircraft
gross profit as a percentage of net revenues decreased slightly to 616 in 2002
from 621 in 2001  this  decrease  as a  percentage  of net  revenues  for the
aviation  segment is primarily  attributed  to product mix as we  experienced  a
194  increase in lower margin panel mount unit sales during 2002 when compared
to 2001

page

67 in the aviation segment the increase in expense was primarily attributable
to increases in employment  generally across the  organization  net increase of
146 employees increased advertising costs up 133 associated primarily with
new product  releases  additional  staffing in the customer  call  center  and
increases in insurance premiums  overall  selling  general and administrative
expenses  increased at a lower rate than revenues due to strong demand for newly
introduced  and  existing  consumer  products  management  expects its selling
general and  administrative  expenses to increase  approximately  1215  during
fiscal 2003 on an absolute dollar basis due to the  anticipated  introduction of
new products for 2003

     research and  development  expenses  increased 40 million  or 142  to
322  million  69 of net  revenues  for fiscal year 2002 from 282 million

other income expense

     other income expense  principally  consists of interest income  interest
expense and foreign currency exchange gains and losses  other income for fiscal
year 2002 amounted to 53 million compared to other income of 207 million for
fiscal  year  2001  with the  majority  of this  difference  caused by  foreign
currency gains in 2001 interest income for fiscal 2002 amounted to 65 million
compared to 112 million for fiscal 2001  the decrease being  attributable  to
the fall in interest rates  reducing the returns on the companys cash and cash
equivalents  interest  expense  decreased  to 13 million for fiscal 2002 from
22 million for fiscal 2001 due primarily to the reduction of debt and a lower
interest rate environment during fiscal 2002

     during  fiscal  2002 the  companys  position  was  neutral  with regard to
foreign  currency  exchange  gains  and  losses  as  the  us  dollar  was  at
approximately the same level at the beginning of 2002 relative to the new taiwan
dollar 3517 ntdusd as it was at the end of fiscal 2002 3490  ntdusd  in
fiscal 2001 there was an 116 million gain due to the  significantly  increased
strength of the us  dollar compared to the new taiwan dollar during 2001 when
the exchange  rate  increased  to 3517  ntdusd at december 29 2001 from 3301
ntdusd at december 30 2000


income tax provision

     income tax expense increased by 14 million to 399 million  for fiscal
year 2002 from  386  million  for fiscal  year 2001 due to our higher  taxable
income the effective tax rate was 219 for fiscal 2002 versus 254 for fiscal
2001  the  decrease in tax rate is due  primarily  to  additional  tax benefits
received  from taiwan as a result of our  continued  capital  investment  in our
manufacturing  facilities there management believes that the effective tax rate
for fiscal 2003 will be comparable to fiscal 2002


net income

     as a result of the above  net income increased 259 to 1428 million for
fiscal year 2002 compared to 1134 million for fiscal year 2001

1058 million for fiscal 2001 from 1156 million for fiscal 2000 the decrease
for fiscal 2001 was primarily due to declining economic  conditions and the shut
down of us  airspace as a result of the  terrorist  attacks  that  occurred on
september 11 2001 in addition to the shut down of us  airspace  the general
aviation   industry  was  further   impacted  by  the  additional   restrictions
implemented by the federal aviation  administration  faa on those flights that
fly utilizing visual flight rules vfr the faa restricted vfr flight inside 30
enhanced class b a 2025 mile radius around the 30 largest  metropolitan  areas
in the  country  airspace  areas  the aircraft  owners and pilots  association
aopa estimated that these restrictions  affected  approximately 41800 general
aviation  aircraft based at 282 airports inside the 30 enhanced class b airspace
areas the aopa estimates that approximately 90 of all general aviation flights
are conducted vfr and that only 15 of general  aviation  pilots are current to
fly utilizing  instrument flight rules ifr  these  restrictions  impacted our
revenues since many general  aviation  aircraft were grounded and were unable to
fly to  aviation  dealers  to buy  our  products  as a  result  of the  factors
indicated above total aviation units sold during fiscal 2001 declined 93 when
compared to fiscal 2000

when compared to 502 for 2000

     gross profit for the aviation segment  decreased 26 million  or 38 to
656 million for fiscal 2001 from 682 million for fiscal 2000 the decline in
gross  profit was  primarily  due to the  decrease in revenues  associated  with
declining economic  conditions and the shut down of us airspace as a result of
the terrorist  attacks that  occurred on september  11 2001  gross profit as a
percentage  of net revenues for the aviation  segment  improved to 621 in 2001
from  590 in 2000  this  improvement  as a  percentage  of net  revenues  was

advertising  costs up 276  associated with new product  releases  increased
costs  associated  with  being a public  company  and  increases  in  insurance
premiums  overall  selling general and administrative expenses increased at a
higher  rate than  revenues  due to the need to rampup  for the  release of new
products

decreased to 22 million for fiscal 2001 from 23 million for fiscal 2000 due

fiscal 2001

     we recognized a foreign currency  exchange gain of 116 million for fiscal
2001 compared to a gain of 70 million for fiscal 2000  the 116 million gain

the new taiwan  dollar during 2001  when the exchange  rate  increased to 3517
ntdusd at december 29 2001 from 3301  ntdusd at december 30 2000  the 70

liquidity and capital resources

     net cash generated by operations was 1754 million  1300  million  and
835 million for fiscal years 2002  2001 and 2000  respectively  we operate
with a strong customer driven approach and therefore carry sufficient  inventory
to meet customer  demand  because we desire to respond quickly to our customers
and minimize order  fulfillment  time  our inventory  levels are generally high
enough to meet most demand we also attempt to carry sufficient inventory levels
on key components so that potential supplier shortages have as minimal an impact
as  possible  on  our  ability  to  deliver  our  finished  products  we do not
anticipate that our inventory management  techniques will have a negative impact
on our financial  results in the future we were able to reduce inventory levels
during  fiscal year 2002 by 36 million when  compared to fiscal year end 2001
without impairing our ability to meet customer demand  by effectively  managing
the  introduction  of 22 new products  during the year we expect that inventory
levels may increase during fiscal 2003 due to anticipated increase in sales

     during fiscal 2002 our capital expenditures  totaled 124 million  which
was 25  million less than during  2001  in fiscal 2001 and 2000  our capital
expenditures   totaled   approximately   149   million   and  248   million
respectively  the expenditures in fiscal 2002 were primarily related to general
corporate  purposes 98 million and the addition of surfacemount  production
equipment  in both  the  olathe  kansas  and  shijr  taiwan  facilities  26
million  the  expenditures  in fiscal  2001 were  incurred  primarily  for the
completed  expansion  of  our  olathe  kansas  facility  32  million   the
construction  of our new flight test and  certification  facility 16 million
located  at the new  century  airport  near  olathe  kansas  and  for  general
corporate  purposes  the expenditures in fiscal 2000 were incurred primarily to
increase our manufacturing  capacity both in the united states and in taiwan we
financed  these capital  expenditures  through net operating  cash flow and debt
from outside financial institutions

     we expect our future capital  requirements  to include  construction  costs
related to our  recentlyannounced  facilities expansion in olathe  kansas and
purchases of production  machinery and equipment to expand  capacity  a portion
will  also be used for  conversion  of  available  space in our  olathe  kansas
building for  manufacturing  use and expansion of our  manufacturing  operations
within our facility in shijr  taiwan  we may use a portion of the net proceeds
from our  december  2000 initial  public  offering  ipo to acquire  targeted
strategic businesses and we continue to look for these opportunities

     in addition to capital expenditures cash flow used in investing activities
principally  relates to the purchase of fixed income securities  associated with
the  investment  of our onhand cash  balances and  approximately  135 million
related to the purchase of licenses  of which 115 million consists of prepaid
royalties  under  our  license  agreement  with  palmsource  inc  for the palm
operating  system it is managements goal to invest the onhand cash consistent
with the companys  investment  policy  which has been approved by the board of
directors  the  investment  policys  primary  purpose is to preserve  capital
maintain an  acceptable  degree of  liquidity  and  maximize  yield  within the
constraint of maximum  safety  the companys  average return on its investments
during fiscal year 2002 was approximately 16

     cash flow used in financing activities during 2002 relates primarily to the
reduction of our debt the company  retired  approximately  122 million of its
longterm  debt during fiscal 2002  consisting  in good part of an  outstanding
issue of industrial revenue bonds the employee stock purchase program and stock
option exercises were sources of cash in 2002 the company retired approximately
142 million of its longterm debt during fiscal 2001 the company  repurchased
595200 shares of its common stock under its stock  repurchase  program that was
approved by the board of directors on september 24 2001 and expired on december
31 2002  the cash flow source from  financing  activities  during 2000 was due
primarily to the issuance of debt and ipo proceeds less dividend distributions

     we  currently   use  cash  flow  from   operations   to  fund  our  capital
expenditures  to repay debt and to support our working capital requirements we
expect  that  future  cash   requirements   will   principally  be  for  capital
expenditures repayment of indebtedness and working capital requirements

     cash dividends paid to stockholders  were 00 million  00 million  and
290 million during fiscal years 2002 2001 and 2000 respectively included in
cash dividends for fiscal 2000 was a special onetime  dividend of 174 million
that was paid in order to provide funds to shareholders to pay withholding taxes
and stock transfer taxes related to the reorganization of garmin corporation

page

     we believe that our existing  cash  balances and cash flow from  operations
will be sufficient to meet our projected capital  expenditures  working capital
and other cash requirements at least through the end of fiscal 2003


contractual obligations and commercial commitments

     on march 23 2000  garmin  international  inc  completed a 200 million
20year  taxable  industrial  revenue bond  issuance  the 2000 bonds for the
expansion of its olathe  kansas  facility  at december  28 2002  outstanding
principal under the 2000 bonds totaled 200 million interest on the 2000 bonds
is payable  monthly at a variable  interest  rate 150 at december 28  2002
which is  adjusted  weekly  to the  current  market  rate as  determined  by the
remarketing  agent of the 2000 bonds with  principal  due upon maturity on april
15 2020

     the 2000 bonds are  secured  by an  irrevocable  letter of credit  totaling
203  million with  facility  fees of 075  this  renewable  letter of credit
initially expires on september 20 2004 the bank has required a sinking fund be
established  with  principal  payments on  longterm  debt  beginning in 2004 of
4002 with semiannual payments of 667 thereafter

     on january 1 1995  garmin  international  inc  completed a 95 million
30year taxexempt  industrial revenue bond issuance for the construction of its
new corporate  headquarters  located in olathe  kansas  upon completion of the
project in 1996  garmin  international  retired  bonds  totaling  02 million
during may of fiscal 2002 the remainder of the  outstanding  bonds were retired
by garmin international inc for a total of 94 million

     the reimbursement agreements entered into by garmin international  inc in
connection  with the 2000 bonds contain  restrictive  covenants  which include
among other things  financial  covenants  requiring minimum cash flow leverage
maximum  capitalization  minimum tangible net worth and other  affirmative and
negative covenants we do not expect these limitations to have a material effect
on our  business  or  results  of  operations  we are in  compliance  with  all
covenants contained in the reimbursement agreements

     during  1999  garmin  corporation  borrowed  180  million to finance the
purchase  of  land  and a new  manufacturing  facility  in  shijr  taiwan  the
outstanding  balance of 28 million at december  29 2001  was paid in full in
january 2002

     we utilize  interest rate swap agreements to manage interest rate exposure
the principal  objective of such financial  derivative  contracts is to moderate
the effect of fluctuations in interest rates we as a matter of policy  do not
speculate in financial  markets and  therefore do not hold these  contracts  for
trading  purposes  we utilize what are considered simple  instruments  such as
nonleveraged interest rate swaps to accomplish our objectives

     the  company  has the  option at any time to retire a portion or all of its
longterm  debt the company  believes the funds necessary to fulfill these debt
obligations and  commitments  will be generated in the course of normal business
operations


offbalance sheet arrangements

     we do not have any offbalance sheet arrangements


recent accounting pronouncements

     in june 2002 the financial  accounting  standards  board  fasb  issued
statement of financial  accounting  standards  sfas no 146  accounting for
costs  associated with exit or disposal  activities  which addresses  financial
accounting and reporting for costs  associated with exit or disposal  activities
and  nullifies  emerging  issues task force eitf  issue no  943  liability
recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an
activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring  the provisions
of this statement are effective for exit or disposal activities  initiated after
december  31  2002  the  company  does not expect  that the  adoption  of this
statement will have a significant impact on the companys  financial position as
no exit or disposal activities are currently planned

page

     in december 2002 the fasb issued sfas no 148  accounting for stockbased
compensation  transition and disclosure  this statement requires all entities
with  stockbased  employee  compensation  arrangements  to  provide  additional
disclosures in their summary of significant  accounting policies note since the
company uses the intrinsic value method of accounting  principles  board apb
opinion  no  25  accounting  for stock  issued to  employees  the  accounting
policies  note will include a tabular  presentation  of pro forma net income and
earnings  per share  using the fair value  method  prescribed  by sfas no  123
accounting for stockbased  compensation  also  sfas no 148 permits  entities
changing to the fair value method of accounting for employee stock  compensation
to choose from one of three transition  methods  the prospective  method  the
modified  prospective method or the retroactive  restatement  method  finally
sfas  no  148  will  require  the  company  to make  interimperiod  pro  forma
disclosures  if  stockbased  compensation  is accounted for under the intrinsic
value  method  in  any  period   presented   the  expanded  annual   disclosure
requirements  and the  transition  provisions  are  effective  for the companys
fiscal  year 2002  the new  interim  period  disclosures  are  required  in the
companys  financial  statements  for  interim  periods  beginning  in the first
quarter of fiscal 2003 this statement has not had and is not expected to have a
material impact on the companys results of operations or financial condition

     in  october  2001  the fasb  issued  sfas  no  144  accounting  for the
impairment  or disposal of  longlived  assets  which is effective  for fiscal
years beginning  after december 15 2001 this new standard  supersedes sfas no
121  accounting  for the  impairment of longlived  assets and for  longlived
assets to be disposed  of  providing  one  accounting  model for the review of
asset  impairment  sfas no 144 retains much of the recognition and measurement
provisions  of sfas no  121  but  removes  goodwill  from its  scope  it also
requires longlived assets to be disposed of other than by sale to be considered
as held and  used  until  disposed  of  requiring  the  depreciable  life to be
adjusted as an accounting change  criteria to classify  longlived assets to be
disposed of by sale has changed from sfas no 121  but these costs  continue to
be  reported  at the lower of their  carrying  amount or fair value less cost to
sell and will cease to be depreciated

     sfas no 144 also  supersedes  the section of the apb opinion no 30 which
prescribes  reporting  for the effects of a disposal of a segment of a business
sfas no 144 retains  the basic  presentation  provisions  of the  opinion  but
requires  losses on a disposal or  discontinued  operation to be  recognized  as
incurred it also broadens the definition of a discontinued operation to include
a component of an entity  the adoption of this statement has not had and is not
expected  to have a material  impact on our  financial  condition  or results of
operations

     in july  2001  the  fasb  issued  sfas  no  143  accounting  for  asset
retirement   obligations  the  objective  of  this  statement  is  to  provide
accounting  guidance for legal  obligations  associated  with the  retirement of
longlived  assets by  requiring  the fair  value of a  liability  for the asset
retirement  obligation  to be  recognized in the period in which it is incurred
when the liability is initially  recognized  the asset  retirement costs should
also be capitalized by increasing the carrying amount of the related  longlived
asset  the  liability is then accreted to its present value each period and the
capitalized  costs are depreciated over the useful life of the associated asset
this statement is effective for fiscal years  beginning after june 15 2002 and
is not expected to have a material impact on our financial statements

     in june 2001 the fasb issued sfas no 141  business  combinations  and
sfas no 142  goodwill and other  intangible  assets sfas no 141 supercedes
apb opinion no 16 business  combinations  and sfas no 28  accounting for
preacquisition contingencies of purchased enterprises this statement requires
accounting for all business  combinations using the purchase method and changes
the  criteria  for  recognizing  intangible  assets  apart from  goodwill  this
statement is effective for all business  combinations  initiated  after june 30
2001  sfas no 142  supercedes  apb  opinion  no 17  intangible  assets and
addresses how purchased  intangibles  should be accounted for upon  acquisition
the statement also addresses how goodwill and other intangible  assets should be
accounted  for after  they  have  been  initially  recognized  in the  financial
statements  all intangibles are subject to periodic  impairment testing and are
adjusted  down to fair value  this  statement  is  effective  for fiscal  years
beginning  after  december  15  2001  and its  adoption has not had and is not
expected  to have a material  impact on our  financial  condition  or results of

companyspecific trends and risks

     you should  carefully  consider  the risks  described  below  regarding  an
investment in our common shares the risks described below are not the only ones
facing our company additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us
or that we  currently  believe to be  immaterial  may also  impair our  business
operations  if  any of the  following  risks  occur  our  business  financial
condition or operating results could be materially adversely affected


risks related to the company

     our global positioning system products depend upon satellites maintained by
the united  states  department  of  defense  if a  significant  number of these
satellites become inoperable unavailable or are not replaced or if the policies
of the united states  government  for the use of the global  positioning  system
without charge are changed or if there is interference  with global  positioning
system signals our business will suffer

     the  global  positioning   system  is  a  satellitebased   navigation  and
positioning  system  consisting of a constellation of orbiting  satellites  the
satellites and their ground  control and monitoring  stations are maintained and
operated by the united states  department of defense  the department of defense
does not  currently  charge  users for access to the  satellite  signals  these
satellites  and their  ground  support  systems are complex  electronic  systems
subject to  electronic  and  mechanical  failures  and  possible  sabotage  the
satellites were  originally  designed to have lives of 75 years and are subject
to damage by the hostile space  environment in which they operate  however  of
the current deployment of satellites in place some have been operating for more
than 11 years

     if  a  significant   number  of  satellites  were  to  become   inoperable
unavailable  or are not  replaced  it would  impair the current  utility of our
global  positioning  system  products  and the growth of current and  additional
market  opportunities  in  addition  there can be no  assurance  that the us
government  will remain  committed to the  operation and  maintenance  of global
positioning  system  satellites over a long period  or that the policies of the
us  government  that  provide  for the use of the  global  positioning  system
without charge and without accuracy  degradation will remain unchanged  because
of the increasing  commercial  applications  of the global  positioning  system
other us  government agencies may become involved in the administration or the
regulation of the use of global positioning system signals

     european  governments  have  expressed  interest in building an independent
satellite  navigation  system  known  as  galileo   depending  on  the  as  yet
undetermined  design and operation of this system  it is possible that it could
cause interference with global positioning system signals

     any of the foregoing  factors could affect the willingness of buyers of our
products to select global positioning  systembased products instead of products
based on competing technologies


a shut down of us airspace would harm our business

     on september  11  2001  terrorists  hijacked  and crashed four  passenger
aircraft  operated by commercial  air carriers  resulting in major loss of life
and   property   following  the  terrorist   attacks   the  federal   aviation
administration faa ordered all aircraft operating in the us to be grounded
for several  days in addition to this shut down of us  airspace  the general
aviation   industry  was  further   impacted  by  the  additional   restrictions
implemented  by the faa on those flights that fly utilizing  visual flight rules
vfr  the faa  restricted  vfr flight inside 30 enhanced class b a 2025 mile
radius around the 30 largest  metropolitan areas in the usa airspace areas the
aircraft owners and pilots  association aopa estimated that these restrictions
affected  approximately  41800 general aviation  aircraft based at 282 airports
inside  the 30  enhanced  class  b  airspace  areas  the  aopa  estimates  that
approximately  90 of all general  aviation  flights are conducted vfr and that
only 15 of general  aviation  pilots are  current to fly  utilizing  instrument
flight rules  ifr  these  restrictions  impacted our revenues in
page

the aviation segment since many general aviation aircraft were grounded and this
caused potential customers to forgo or defer purchasing our aviation products

     the shut down of us airspace following the september 11 2001 also caused
delays in the shipment of our products  manufactured in our taiwan manufacturing
facility to our  distribution  facility  in olathe  kansas  thereby  adversely
affecting  our  ability to supply new and  existing  products to our dealers and
distributors

     any future shut down of us  airspace or  imposition  of  restrictions  on
general  aviation  could  have a material  adverse  effect on our  business  and
financial results


any reallocation of radio frequency  spectrum could cause  interference with the
reception of global positioning system signals this interference could harm our
business

     our global  positioning  system  technology  is dependent on the use of the
standard  positioning  service sps  provided by the us  governments  global
positioning system  satellites  the global positioning system operates in radio
frequency  bands that are  globally  allocated  for radio  navigation  satellite
services   the  assignment  of  spectrum  is  controlled  by  an  international
organization known as the international  telecommunications  union itu  the
federal  communications  commission fcc is responsible for the assignment of
spectrum for  nongovernment  use in the united  states in  accordance  with itu
regulations  any itu or fcc reallocation of radio frequency spectrum including
frequency band  segmentation  or sharing of spectrum  could cause  interference
with the reception of global  positioning  system signals and may materially and
adversely  affect the utility and  reliability of our products  which would in
turn  have a material  adverse  effect on our operating  results  in addition
emissions  from  mobile  satellite  service  and other  equipment  operating  in
adjacent  frequency  bands or inband may  materially  and  adversely  affect the
utility  and  reliability  of our  products  which  could  result in a material
adverse effect on our operating results


ultrawideband  radio  devices  could cause  interference  with the reception of
global  positioning  system  signals if the fcc were to change  its rules  this
interference could harm our business

     on february 13 2003  the fcc adopted a memorandum  opinion and order the
order  that  allows a limited  number of  ultrawideband  uwb  devices to
operate on a licensed basis in the frequency band used by the global positioning
system the order limits these devices to use by qualified  emergency  officials
at emission  limits  that  protect the global  positioning  system  the fcc has
stated  that it plans to review the rules of  operation  for uwb  devices  again
within a twelve to eighteen  month period  following the date of adoption of the
order  if the fcc were to issue a further  rule  authorizing  operation  of uwb
devices in the frequency  band used by the global  positioning  system at higher
power  levels  than  those  set  out  in  the  order  or  otherwise  change  the
definitional  or  operational  characteristics  of permitted  uwb devices  such
devices might cause interference with the reception of global positioning system
signals  such interference  could reduce demand for global  positioning  system
products  in the  future  any  resulting  change in market  demand  for  global
positioning  system  products  could  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on our
financial results


if we are not successful in the continued  development  introduction  or timely
manufacture of new products demand for our products could decrease

     we expect that a significant portion of our future revenue will continue to
be derived from sales of newly introduced products  the market for our products
is characterized by rapidly changing technology evolving industry standards and
changes in  customer  needs  if we fail to modify or improve  our  products  in
response to changes in technology  industry  standards or customer  needs  our
products could rapidly become less competitive or obsolete  we must continue to
make significant investments in research and development in order to continue to
develop new products  enhance existing  products and achieve market  acceptance
for such products  however  there can be no assurance that  development  stage
products  will  be  successfully  completed  or  if  developed   will  achieve
significant customer acceptance

page

         if we are unable to successfully develop and introduce competitive new
products and enhance our existing products our future results of operations
would be adversely affected our pursuit of necessary technology may require
substantial time and expense we may need to license new technologies to respond
to technological change these licenses may not be available to us on terms that
we can accept we may not succeed in adapting our products to new technologies
as they emerge development and manufacturing schedules for technology products
are difficult to predict and there can be no assurance that we will achieve
timely initial customer shipments of new products the timely availability of
these products in volume and their acceptance by customers are important to our
future success we have previously experienced delays in shipping certain of our
products and any future delays whether due to manufacturing delays lack of
market acceptance delays in regulatory approval or otherwise could have a
material adverse effect on our results of operations


if we do not correctly anticipate demand for our products we may not be able to
secure sufficient quantities or costeffective  production of our products or we
could have costly excess production or inventories

     historically  we have  experienced  steady  increases  in  demand  for our
products  although  we did  experience  a decline  in demand  for our  aviation
products in 2001 due to declining economic  conditions and the shut down of us
airspace as a result of the  terrorist  attacks that  occurred on september  11
2001  and we have  generally  been  able to  increase  production  to meet that
demand however the demand for our products depends on many factors and will be
difficult to forecast  we expect that it will become more difficult to forecast
demand as we introduce and support  multiple  products and as competition in the
market for our products intensifies  significant unanticipated  fluctuations in
demand could cause the following problems in our operations

         o if demand increases beyond what we forecast we would have to rapidly
           increase production we would depend on suppliers to provide
           additional volumes of components and those suppliers might not be
           able to increase production rapidly enough to meet unexpected demand

         o rapid increases in production levels to meet unanticipated demand
           could result in higher costs for manufacturing and supply of
           components and other expenses these higher costs could lower our
           profit margins further if production is increased rapidly
           manufacturing quality could decline which may also lower our
           margins

         o if forecasted demand does not develop we could have excess
           production resulting in higher inventories of finished products and
           components which would use cash and could lead to writeoffs of some
           or all of the excess inventories lower than forecasted demand could
           also result in excess manufacturing capacity at our facilities which
           could result in lower margins


we may become subject to significant product liability costs

     if our aviation products malfunction or contain errors or defects airplane
collisions or crashes could occur resulting in property damage  personal injury
or death  malfunctions or errors or defects in our marine navigational products
could cause boats to run aground or cause  other  wreckage  personal  injury or
death  if any of  these  events  occurs  we could be  subject  to  significant
liability for personal injury and property damage we maintain insurance against
accidentrelated  risks  involving  our  products  however  there  can  be  no
assurance that such  insurance  would be sufficient to cover the cost of damages
to others or that such insurance  will continue to be available at  commercially
reasonable  rates  if we are unable to maintain  sufficient  insurance to cover
product liability costs our business could be harmed


we  depend on our  suppliers  some of which are the sole  source  for  specific
components  and our production would be seriously harmed if these suppliers are
not able to meet our demand and alternative sources are not available or if the
costs of components rise

     we are dependent on third party  suppliers for various  components  used in
our current  products  some of the components  that we procure from third party
suppliers include semiconductors and  electroluminescent  panels liquid crystal
displays  memory chips and microprocessors  the cost quality and availability
of  components  are


page

essential to the successful production and sale of our products some components
come  from  our  sole  source   suppliers   international   business   machines
corporation rf micro devices inc nec electronics  inc and texas instruments
taiwan   ltd   are  each   the  sole   source   supplier   to  us  of   certain
applicationspecific  integrated circuits  incorporating our proprietary designs
which they manufacture for us intel  corporation is the sole source supplier of
certain  microprocessors used in some of our products  analog devices  inc is
the sole source  supplier of a  microprocessor  used in our navtalk gsm and ique
3600 products  motorola  inc is the sole source supplier of a  microprocessor
used  in our  ique  3600  product  alternative  sources  may  not be  currently
available for these sole source components

     in  the  past  we  have  experienced  shortages   particularly  involving
components  that are also used in cellular  phones  in  addition  if there are
shortages in supply of  components  the costs of such  components  may rise if
suppliers are unable to meet our demand for  components on a timely basis and if
we are unable to obtain an alternative source or if the price of the alternative
source is  prohibitive  or if the costs of  components  rise  our  ability  to
maintain timely and costeffective production of our products would be seriously
harmed

     we license mapping data for use in our products from various sources there
are only a limited  number of suppliers  of mapping  data for each  geographical
region if we are unable to continue  licensing such mapping data and are unable
to obtain an alternative  source  or if the price of the alternative  source is
prohibitive our ability to supply mapping data for use in our products would be
seriously harmed


we rely on  independent  dealers  and  distributors  to sell our  products  and
disruption to these channels would harm our business

     because we sell a majority  of our  products  to  independent  dealers  and
distributors  we are subject to many risks  including  risks  related to their
inventory  levels and support for our products  in particular  our dealers and
distributors  maintain  significant levels of our products in their inventories
if dealers and  distributors  attempt to reduce  their levels of inventory or if
they do not maintain  sufficient levels to meet customer demand our sales could
be negatively impacted

     our dealers and distributors also sell products offered by our competitors
if our  competitors  offer our dealers and  distributors  more favorable  terms
those  dealers  and  distributors  may  deemphasize  or  decline  to carry  our
products  in the future  we may not be able to retain or attract a  sufficient
number of  qualified  dealers  and  distributors  if we are unable to  maintain
successful  relationships  with  dealers  and  distributors  or  to  expand  our
distribution channels our business will suffer


if we fail to manage our growth and expansion effectively we may not be able to
successfully manage our business

     our ability to  successfully  offer our products and implement our business
plan in a rapidly evolving market requires an effective  planning and management
process  we continue to increase the scope of our operations  domestically  and
internationally and have grown our shipments and headcount  substantially  this
growth has placed and our anticipated growth in future operations will continue
to place a significant strain on our management systems and resources


our  business  may  suffer  if we are not  able to hire  and  retain  sufficient
qualified personnel or if we lose our key personnel

     our future success depends partly on the continued  contribution of our key
executive  engineering  sales  marketing  manufacturing  and  administrative
personnel  we currently do not have  employment  agreements with any of our key
executive  officers  we do not have key man  life  insurance  on any of our key
executive  officers and do not currently  intend to obtain such  insurance  the
loss of the  services  of any of our  senior  level  management  or  other  key
employees  could  harm our  business  recruiting  and  retaining  the  skilled
personnel  we require to maintain  our market  position  may be  difficult  for
example  in recent  years there has been a  nationwide  shortage  of  qualified
electrical  engineers and software  engineers who are necessary for us to design
and develop new products

page

and therefore  it has been challenging to recruit such personnel if we fail to
hire and retain qualified  employees  we may not be able to maintain and expand
our business


our sales and gross margins for our products may fluctuate or erode

     our sales and gross margins for our products may  fluctuate  from period to
period due to a number of factors  including product mix  competition and unit
volumes in particular the average selling prices of a specific product tend to
decrease over that products life to offset such  decreases  we intend to rely
primarily on obtaining yield  improvements and corresponding  cost reductions in
the  manufacture  of existing  products and on  introducing  new  products  that
incorporate  advanced  features  and  therefore  can be sold at  higher  average
selling  prices  however  there  can be no  assurance  that we will be able to
obtain any such yield  improvements or cost reductions or introduce any such new
products in the future  to the extent that such cost reductions and new product
introductions do not occur in a timely manner or our customers  products do not
achieve  market  acceptance  our business  financial  condition and results of
operations could be materially  adversely affected  as we introduce new product
lines that serve cellular  handset  personal  digital  assistant  family radio
service  and  original  equipment  manufacturer   automotive  and  sensor  board
applications  we may  experience  a decline in our overall  gross  margins from
sales of these potentially high volume but low margin product lines


our quarterly operating results are subject to fluctuations and seasonality

     our  operating  results  are  difficult  to predict  our future  quarterly
operating results may fluctuate significantly  if this occurs the price of our
stock would likely decline as we expand our operations our operating expenses
particularly  our sales  marketing  and research  and  development  costs  may
increase  if revenues decrease and we are unable to reduce those costs rapidly
our operating results would be negatively affected

     historically  our revenues have usually been weaker in the first and third
quarters of each fiscal  year and have  from time to time  been lower than the
preceding quarter our devices are highly consumeroriented and consumer buying
is  traditionally  lower in these  quarters  sales of certain  of our  consumer
products  tend to be  higher  in our  second  fiscal  quarter  due to  increased
consumer  spending for such products during the recreational  marine and fishing
season  sales of certain of our consumer products also tend to be higher in our
fourth fiscal quarter due to increased  consumer spending patterns on electronic
devices  during the  holiday  season  in  addition  we attempt to time our new
product  releases to coincide with relatively  higher  consumer  spending in the
second  and  fourth  fiscal  quarters   which  contributes  to  these  seasonal
variations


because our reporting currency is in us dollars and the functional currency of
one of our primary  operating  subsidiaries is in new taiwan  dollars  exchange
rate fluctuations impact the financial  statements of this operating  subsidiary
and our consolidated financial statements

     foreign  exchange  effects  on our  financial  statements  can be  material
because our reporting currency is in us dollars while the functional  currency
of garmin  corporation  one of our  operating  subsidiaries  is in new  taiwan
dollars  we are exposed to foreign exchange risks related to recurring  foreign
currency  payments  principally in us dollars  in addition  fluctuations in
exchange  rates  between the us  dollar and the new taiwan  dollar may have an
adverse  impact on the  financial  statements of garmin  corporation  and as a
consequence   upon  consolidation  have  an  indirect  adverse  effect  on  our
consolidated financial statements


if we are unable to compete  effectively with existing or new  competitors  our
resulting loss of competitive  position could result in price reductions  fewer
customer orders reduced margins and loss of market share

     the  markets  for  our  products  are  highly  competitive  and  we  expect
competition  to increase in the future  we plan to enter the  cellular  handset
market and the portable digital  assistant market and will be competing  against
telefon ab lm ericsson  motorola  inc nokia oy palm inc sony corporation
and hewlettpackard company with certain products these competitors as well as
some of our existing  competitors  or potential  competitors  such as honeywell
international  inc and ups aviation  technologies  have significantly greater
financial  technical and

page

marketing  resources than we do these  competitors  may be able to respond more
rapidly to new or emerging  technologies  or changes in  customer  requirements
they may also be able to devote greater resources to the development  promotion
and  sale of  their  products  increased  competition  could  result  in  price
reductions fewer customer orders reduced margins and loss of market share our
failure to compete  successfully  against  current or future  competitors  could
seriously harm our business financial condition and results of operations


our intellectual  property rights are important to our operations  and we could
suffer  loss if they  infringe  upon  others  rights or are  infringed  upon by
others

     we rely on a  combination  of  patents  copyrights  trademarks  and trade
secrets  confidentiality provisions and licensing arrangements to establish and
protect  our  proprietary  rights  to this end  we hold  rights to a number of
patents and registered  trademarks and regularly file applications to attempt to
protect  our  rights in new  technology  and  trademarks  however  there is no
guarantee that our patent  applications will become issued patents  or that our
trademark  applications will become  registered  trademarks  moreover  even if
approved our patents or trademarks may thereafter be successfully challenged by
others or otherwise  become  invalidated for a variety of reasons  in addition
the only  patents  we have  obtained  are us  patents  thus  any  patents or
trademarks  we  currently  have  or may  later  acquire  may  not  provide  us a
significant competitive advantage

     third parties may claim that we are infringing their intellectual  property
rights  such claims  could have a serious  adverse  effect on our  business and
financial  condition   litigation  concerning  patents  or  other  intellectual
property  can be  costly  and time  consuming  we may seek  licenses  from such
parties  but they  could  refuse to grant us a license  or demand  commercially
unreasonable  terms  we might  not  have  sufficient  resources  to pay for the
licenses  such  infringement  claims  could also cause us to incur  substantial
liabilities and to suspend or permanently cease the use of critical technologies
or processes or the production or sale of major products


failure to obtain  required  certifications  of our  products on a timely  basis
could harm our business

     we have certain  products  especially  in our aviation  segment  that are
subject to governmental and similar  certifications before they can be sold for
example  federal aviation  administration faa certification is required for
all of our  aviation  products  that  are  intended  for  installation  in  type
certificated  aircraft  to the extent that it is required  certification is an
expensive  and time  consuming  process  that  requires  significant  focus  and
resources  an  inability  to obtain  or  excessive  delay in  obtaining  such
certifications  could have an adverse  effect on our  ability to  introduce  new
products and therefore  our operating results  in addition  we cannot assure
you  that  our   certified   products   will  not  be   decertified   any  such
decertification could have an adverse effect on our operating results


our business is subject to economic  political and other risks  associated with
international sales and operations

     our  business  is  subject  to  risks   associated   with  doing   business
internationally  we  estimate  that  approximately  27 of our net sales in the
fiscal  year  ended   december  28  2002   represented   products   shipped  to
international destinations accordingly our future results could be harmed by a
variety of international factors including

         o changes in foreign currency exchange rates

         o changes in a specific countrys or regions political or economic
           conditions particularly in emerging markets

         o trade protection measures and import or export licensing
           requirements

         o potentially negative consequences from changes in tax laws

         o difficulty in managing widespread sales and manufacturing operations
           and
page

         o less effective protection of intellectual property


we may experience  unique economic and political risks associated with companies
that operate in taiwan

     relations  between taiwan and the peoples republic of china also referred
to as the prc and other factors affecting the political or economic  conditions
of taiwan in the future  could  affect our business and the market price and the
liquidity  of our  shares  our  principal  manufacturing  facilities  where  we
manufacture all of our products except our panelmounted aviation products are
located in taiwan

     taiwan  has a  unique  international  political  status  the  prc  asserts
sovereignty over all of china  including taiwan  certain other islands and all
of mainland  china  the prc government does not recognize the legitimacy of the
taiwan  government  although  significant  economic and cultural relations have
been  established  during  recent  years  between  taiwan  and the prc  the prc
government  has  indicated  that it may use military  force to gain control over
taiwan in certain  circumstances  such as the  declaration of  independence  by
taiwan relations between taiwan and the prc have on occasion adversely affected
the  market  value of  taiwanese  companies  and  could  negatively  affect  our
operations in taiwan in the future


there is uncertainty as to our shareholders  ability to enforce certain foreign
civil liabilities in the cayman islands and taiwan

     we are a cayman islands company and a substantial portion of our assets are
located outside the united states  particularly in taiwan  as a result it may
be difficult for you to effect  service of process within the united states upon
us in  addition  there is  uncertainty  as to whether the courts of the cayman
islands and taiwan would recognize or enforce  judgments of united states courts
obtained  against  us  predicated  upon the civil  liability  provisions  of the
securities  laws of the united states or any state  thereof  or be competent to
hear  original  actions  brought  in the  cayman  islands  or taiwan  against us
predicated upon the securities laws of the united states or any state thereof


our shareholders may face  difficulties in protecting their interests because we
are incorporated under cayman islands law

     our  corporate  affairs are  governed  by our  memorandum  and  articles of
association  and by the companies law 2002  revision and the common law of the
cayman   islands   the   rights   of  our   shareholders   and  the   fiduciary
responsibilities  of our directors  under cayman  islands law are not as clearly
established   as  under   statutes  or  judicial   precedent   in  existence  in
jurisdictions in the united states  therefore our public shareholders may have
more  difficulty  in  protecting  their  interests in the face of actions by the
management directors or our controlling shareholders than would shareholders of
a corporation  incorporated in a jurisdiction  in the united states  due to the
comparatively less developed nature of cayman islands law in this area


we may pursue strategic  acquisitions  investments  strategic  partnerships or
other  ventures  and our  business  could be  materially  harmed  if we fail to
successfully identify complete and integrate such transactions

     we intend to evaluate  acquisition  opportunities and opportunities to make
investments in complementary businesses  technologies services or products or
to enter into any strategic  partnerships with parties who can provide access to
those assets  additional product or services  offerings or additional  industry
expertise  we currently have no commitments to make any material investments or
acquisitions  or to enter  into  strategic  partnerships  we may not  identify
suitable acquisition  investment or strategic partnership candidates  or if we
do identify  suitable  candidates  we may not complete  those  transactions  on
commercially favorable terms or at all

     any future acquisition could result in difficulties  assimilating  acquired
operations and products and diversion of capital and managements attention away
from other business issues and opportunities  integration of acquired companies
may result in problems  related to integration  of technology and  inexperienced
management

page

teams in addition  the key personnel of the acquired company may decide not to
work for us our  management  has not had  experience in  assimilating  acquired
organizations  and  products  into  our  operations  we  may  not  successfully
integrate  any  operations  personnel  or  products  that we may acquire in the
future  if we fail to successfully  integrate such  transactions  our business
could be materially harmed


we have benefited in the past from taiwan  government tax incentives  offered on
certain high technology capital investments that may not always be available

     our  effective  tax rate is lower  than the us  federal  statutory  rate
because we have  benefited  from lower tax rates  since our  inception  and from
incentives  offered in taiwan  related  to our high  technology  investments  in
taiwan  the loss of these tax benefits  could have a significant  effect on our
financial results in the future


changes in our united states federal income tax  classification or in applicable
tax law could result in adverse tax consequences to our shareholders

     we do not believe that we or any of our  nonunited  states  subsidiaries
are  currently  a  foreign   personal  holding  company  or  passive  foreign
investment  company for united states  federal  income tax  purposes  we would
constitute a foreign personal holding company in any taxable year if 1 60 or
50 in any year  following the year in which we first became a foreign  personal
holding  company or more of our gross  income  were  foreign  personal  holding
company income which is generally income of a passive nature such as dividends
interest and royalties  the income test and 2 more than 50 of the voting
power or value of our equity were  owned  directly  or  indirectly  by five or
fewer us holders that are individuals the shareholder  test if we or any
of our nonunited  states  subsidiaries  are  classified as a foreign  personal
holding  company in any taxable  year  then each  shareholder  that is a united
states  person  would  be  required  to pay tax on its  pro  rata  share  of the
undistributed  foreign  personal holding income of such foreign personal holding
company  we currently  satisfy the shareholder test for qualifying as a foreign
personal  holding  company  but intend to manage our affairs so as to attempt to
avoid  satisfaction  of the income  test for  qualifying  as a foreign  personal
holding  company  or minimize the impact to our  shareholders if we satisfy the
income test  to the extent this  management  of our affairs would be consistent
with our business goals although we cannot assure you in this regard

     we do not expect to become a passive foreign investment  company  however
because the passive foreign investment company determination is made annually on
the basis of facts and circumstances  that may be beyond our control and because
the principles for applying the passive foreign investment company tests are not
entirely  clear  we cannot assure you that we will not become a passive foreign
investment  company if we are a passive foreign investment company in any year
then any of our  shareholders  that is a united states person could be liable to
pay  tax at  ordinary  income  tax  rates  plus an  interest  charge  upon  some
distributions by us or when that shareholder  sells our common shares at a gain
further  if we are classified as a passive  foreign  investment  company in any
year in which a  united  states  person  is a  shareholder  we  generally  will
continue to be treated as a passive foreign  investment  company with respect to
such shareholder in all succeeding  years  regardless of whether we continue to
satisfy the income or asset tests described above additional tax considerations
would  apply  if we or  any  of  our  subsidiaries  were  a  controlled  foreign
corporation or a personal holding company


risks relating to our shares

we do not plan to pay dividends in the foreseeable future

     we do not currently  anticipate  paying cash dividends for the  foreseeable
future  in addition  if in the future we  determined  to pay  dividends on our
shares  as a holding company  we may be dependent on receipt of funds from our
operating  subsidiaries  our principal operating subsidiary is a taiwan company
and  dividends  payable  to us from  that  company  would be  subject  to taiwan
withholding tax

the markets for high technology stocks have experienced extreme volatility and
our share price may be subject to significant fluctuations and volatility

     the markets for high technology stocks have experienced  extreme volatility
that has often been  unrelated to the operating  performance  of the  particular
companies  these broad market  fluctuations  may  adversely  affect the trading
price of our common shares


our officers and directors exert substantial influence over us

     members of our board of directors and our executive officers together with
members of their  families  and  entities  that may be deemed  affiliates  of or
related to such persons or entities  beneficially own  approximately 44 of our
outstanding  common  shares  accordingly  these  shareholders  may be  able to
determine the outcome of corporate actions requiring shareholder approval  such
as mergers and  acquisitions  this level of  ownership  may have a  significant
effect in delaying  deferring  or  preventing a change in control of garmin and
may adversely  affect the voting and other rights of other holders of our common
shares


prior to 2006 without the approval of a majority of certain of our
shareholders we may not dispose of our shares of garmin corporation or its
assets even if it would benefit all of our shareholders

     in connection  with the  reorganization  whereby  garmin became the holding
company for garmin corporation  shareholders of garmin corporation entered into
a shareholders agreement whereby each shareholder party to the agreement agreed
to take all reasonable  actions required to prevent the disposition by garmin of
any shares of garmin corporation or of substantially all of the assets of garmin
corporation  until after december 31 2005 except upon approval of a majority in
interest of such shareholders who are us citizens or residents certain of our
officers and directors own a substantial portion of these shares


provisions in our charter documents might deter delay or prevent a third party
from acquiring us which could decrease the value of our shares

     our board of directors has the authority to issue up to 1000000 preferred
shares  and  to  determine  the  price  rights  preferences   privileges  and
restrictions  including voting rights of those shares without any further vote
or action by the  shareholders  this could have an adverse impact on the market
price of our  common  shares  we have no present  plans to issue any  preferred
shares  but we may do so  the rights of the  holders  of common  shares may be
subject  to  and  adversely  affected  by  the  rights of the  holders  of any
preferred shares that may be issued in the future in addition  we have adopted
a  classified  board of  directors  our  shareholders  are unable to remove any
director or the entire  board of directors  without a super  majority  vote  in
addition  a super  majority  vote is  required  to  approve  transactions  with
interested  shareholders   shareholders  do  not  have  the  right  to  call  a
shareholders  meeting  we have adopted a shareholders  rights plan which under
certain circumstances would significantly impair the ability of third parties to
acquire  control of us without prior  approval of our board of  directors  this
shareholders rights plan and the provisions in our charter documents could make
it more  difficult  for a third  party  to  acquire  us  even if doing so would
benefit our shareholders




item 7a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

         market sensitivity

     we have  market  risk  primarily  in  connection  with the  pricing  of our
products and services and the purchase of raw materials product pricing and raw
materials  costs  are both  significantly  influenced  by  semiconductor  market
conditions  historically during cyclical industry downturns we have been able
to offset  pricing  declines for our products  through a combination of improved
product mix and success in obtaining price reductions in raw materials costs

page

     inflation

     we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our business
financial  condition  or  results  of  operations  if our costs  were to become
subject  to  significant  inflationary  pressures  we may not be able to  fully
offset such higher costs through price increases our inability or failure to do
so could  adversely  affect our  business  financial  condition  and results of
operations

     foreign currency exchange rate risk

     the  operation  of the  companys  subsidiaries  in  international  markets
results in exposure to movements in currency  exchange  rates we generally have
not been significantly  affected by foreign exchange fluctuations because until
recently the taiwan dollar has proven to be relatively stable  however during
2000 and 2001 we  experienced  significant  foreign  currency  gains  due to the
strengthening  of the us  dollar  the potential of volatile  foreign exchange
rate  fluctuations in the future could have a significant  effect on our results
of operations

     the  principal   currency  involved  is  the  new  taiwan  dollar   garmin
corporation  located in shijr taiwan uses the local currency as the functional
currency the company translates all assets and liabilities at yearend exchange
rates and income and expense accounts at average rates during the year in order
to minimize the effect of the currency exchange  fluctuations on our net assets
we have elected to retain most of our taiwan  subsidiarys cash in us dollars
as discussed above  the exchange rate can be volatile  while the net effect of
foreign currency moves in fiscal 2002 was neutral there were significant shifts
in the exchange rate  throughout  2002  the exchange rate increased 65 during
2001 and resulted in a foreign  currency gain of 116 million  if the exchange
rate decreased by a similar percentage a comparable foreign currency loss would
be recognized  a 10 positive or negative change in the us dollar exchange rate
versus the new taiwan dollar would have  resulted in a foreign  currency gain of
187 million  positive 10 change or a foreign currency loss of 189 million
negative 10 change respectively during 2002

     interest rate risk

     as of december 28 2002 we have interest rate risk in connection  with our
industrial  revenue  bonds  that  bear  interest  at  a  floating  rate  garmin
international  inc entered into two interest rate swap agreements one on july
1 2000 100  million  notional and another on february 6 2001 50 million
notional   totaling  150  million  to  modify  the  characteristics  of  its
outstanding  longterm  debt from a floating  rate to a fixed rate basis  these
agreements  involve the receipt of floating  rate  amounts in exchange for fixed
rate interest  payments over the life of the  agreements  without an exchange of
the underlying  principal amount  the estimated fair value of the interest swap
agreements  of 10  million  is the  amount  we  would  be  required  to pay to
terminate  the swap  agreements at december 28 2002 a 10 positive or negative
change in the floating  counterparty  interest rates  associated  with the swaps
would change the estimated  fair value of the interest  rate swap  agreements to
09  million  positive  10 change or 11  million  negative  10  change
respectively

     the companys average outstanding debt during fiscal 2002 was approximately
26 million  the average interest rate on debt during fiscal 2002 was 50 the
average  outstanding  debt  during  fiscal  year  2001 was  approximately  393
million  the average  interest  rate on debt during fiscal 2001 was 55 a 10
positive or  negative  change in the average  interest  rate during  fiscal 2002
would have resulted in interest expense of 14 million positive 10 change or
12 million  negative 10 change  respectively  this compares to the actual
interest expense of 13 million during fiscal 2002

     in addition  at december 28 2002 the company is exposed to interest  rate
risk in connection  with its investments in marketable  securities  as interest
rates change  the unrealized gains and losses  associated with those securities
will fluctuate accordingly a hypothetical change of 10 in interest rates would
not have a material effect on such unrealized gains and losses at december 28
2002 unrealized gains on those securities were 12 million
